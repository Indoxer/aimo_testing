 The problem: 
For any finite set $X$, let $| X |$ denote the number of elements in $X$. Define
\[S_n = \sum | A \cap B | ,\]
where the sum is taken over all ordered pairs $(A, B)$ such that $A$ and $B$ are subsets of $\left\{ 1 , 2 , 3,  \cdots , n \right\}$ with $|A| = |B|$.
For example, $S_2 = 4$ because the sum is taken over the pairs of subsets
\[(A, B) \in \left\{ (\emptyset, \emptyset) , ( \{1\} , \{1\} ), ( \{1\} , \{2\} ) , ( \{2\} , \{1\} ) , ( \{2\} , \{2\} ) , ( \{1 , 2\} , \{1 , 2\} ) \right\} ,\]
giving $S_2 = 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 2 = 4$.
Let $\frac{S_{2022}}{S_{2021}} = \frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find the remainder when $p + q$ is divided by
1000.


To find \( S_n \), we need to sum \( |A \cap B| \) over all ordered pairs \((A, B)\) where \( A \) and \( B \) are subsets of \(\{1, 2, \ldots, n\}\) with \( |A| = |B| = k \). The value \( |A \cap B| \) counts the number of elements in the intersection of \( A \) and \( B \).

First, consider the number of ways to choose subsets \( A \) and \( B \) both of size \( k \). This is given by \( \binom{n}{k}^2 \). For each such pair \((A, B)\), we need to count the number of elements in \( A \cap B \).

For a fixed element \( i \) in \(\{1, 2, \ldots, n\}\), the probability that \( i \) is in both \( A \) and \( B \) is the probability that \( i \) is in \( A \) and also in \( B \). The probability that \( i \) is in \( A \) is \( \frac{k}{n} \), and the probability that \( i \) is in \( B \) is also \( \frac{k}{n} \). Therefore, the probability that \( i \) is in both \( A \) and \( B \) is \( \left( \frac{k}{n} \right)^2 \).

Since there are \( n \) elements in the set, the expected number of elements in \( A \cap B \) is \( n \left( \frac{k}{n} \right)^2 = \frac{k^2}{n} \). Thus, the total sum \( S_n \) is:
\[
S_n = \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k}^2 \cdot \frac{k^2}{n} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k}^2 k^2.
\]

Using the identity \( \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k}^2 k^2 = n \binom{2n-2}{n-1} \), we get:
\[
S_n = \frac{1}{n} \cdot n \binom{2n-2}{n-1} = \binom{2n-2}{n-1}.
\]

Now, we need to find \( \frac{S_{2022}}{S_{2021}} \):
\[
\frac{S_{2022}}{S_{2021}} = \frac{\binom{4042}{2021}}{\binom{4040}{2020}} = \frac{4042! / (2021! \cdot 2021!)}{4040! / (2020! \cdot 2020!)} = \frac{4042 \cdot 4041}{2021 \cdot 2021} = 2 \cdot 2 = 4.
\]

Thus, \( \frac{S_{2022}}{S_{2021}} = \frac{4}{1} \), so \( p = 4 \) and \( q = 1 \). Therefore, \( p + q = 5 \), and the remainder when \( p + q \) is divided by 1000 is:
\[
\boxed{5}.
