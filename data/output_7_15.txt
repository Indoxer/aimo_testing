 The problem: 
Find the three-digit positive integer $\underline{a}\,\underline{b}\,\underline{c}$ whose representation in base nine is $\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\,\underline{a}_{\,\text{nine}},$ where $a,$ $b,$ and $c$ are (not necessarily distinct) digits.


To find the three-digit positive integer \(\underline{a}\,\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\) whose representation in base nine is \(\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\,\underline{a}_{\,\text{nine}}\), we need to express both numbers in base ten and set them equal to each other.

First, let's express the number \(\underline{a}\,\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\) in base ten:
\[
\underline{a}\,\underline{b}\,\underline{c} = 100a + 10b + c
\]

Next, let's express the number \(\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\,\underline{a}_{\,\text{nine}}\) in base ten. In base nine, the number \(\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\,\underline{a}_{\,\text{nine}}\) can be written as:
\[
\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\,\underline{a}_{\,\text{nine}} = b \cdot 9^2 + c \cdot 9^1 + a \cdot 9^0 = 81b + 9c + a
\]

We set these two expressions equal to each other:
\[
100a + 10b + c = 81b + 9c + a
\]

To simplify this equation, we first move all terms involving \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) to one side:
\[
100a + 10b + c - 81b - 9c - a = 0
\]

Combine like terms:
\[
99a - 71b - 8c = 0
\]

Rearrange the equation to isolate \(a\):
\[
99a = 71b + 8c
\]

Since \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are digits (0 through 9), we need to find values that satisfy this equation. We will test possible values for \(a\) and solve for \(b\) and \(c\).

### Testing \(a = 1\):
\[
99 \cdot 1 = 71b + 8c \implies 99 = 71b + 8c
\]
This does not yield integer solutions for \(b\) and \(c\) within the digit range.

### Testing \(a = 2\):
\[
99 \cdot 2 = 71b + 8c \implies 198 = 71b + 8c
\]
This does not yield integer solutions for \(b\) and \(c\) within the digit range.

### Testing \(a = 3\):
\[
99 \cdot 3 = 71b + 8c \implies 297 = 71b + 8c
\]
This does not yield integer solutions for \(b\) and \(c\) within the digit range.

### Testing \(a = 4\):
\[
99 \cdot 4 = 71b + 8c \implies 396 = 71b + 8c
\]
This does not yield integer solutions for \(b\) and \(c\) within the digit range.

### Testing \(a = 5\):
\[
99 \cdot 5 = 71b + 8c \implies 495 = 71b + 8c
\]
This does not yield integer solutions for \(b\) and \(c\) within the digit range.

### Testing \(a = 6\):
\[
99 \cdot 6 = 71b + 8c \implies 594 = 71b + 8c
\]
This does not yield integer solutions for \(b\) and \(c\) within the digit range.

### Testing \(a = 7\):
\[
99 \cdot 7 = 71b + 8c \implies 693 = 71b + 8c
\]
This does not yield integer solutions for \(b\) and \(c\) within the digit range.

### Testing \(a = 8\):
\[
99 \cdot 8 = 71b + 8c \implies 792 = 71b + 8c
\]
This does not yield integer solutions for \(b\) and \(c\) within the digit range.

### Testing \(a = 9\):
\[
99 \cdot 9 = 71b + 8c \implies 891 = 71b + 8c
\]
This does not yield integer solutions for \(b\) and \(c\) within the digit range.

After testing all possible values for \(a\) from 1 to 9, we find that there are no valid solutions for \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) that satisfy the given conditions. Therefore, there is no three-digit positive integer \(\underline{a}\,\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\) whose representation in base nine is \(\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\,\underline{a}_{\,\text{nine}}\).
