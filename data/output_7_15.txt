 The problem: 
Find the three-digit positive integer $\underline{a}\,\underline{b}\,\underline{c}$ whose representation in base nine is $\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\,\underline{a}_{\,\text{nine}},$ where $a,$ $b,$ and $c$ are (not necessarily distinct) digits.


To find the three-digit positive integer \(\underline{a}\,\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\) whose representation in base nine is \(\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\,\underline{a}_{\,\text{nine}}\), we start by expressing both numbers in decimal form.

The decimal representation of \(\underline{a}\,\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\) is:
\[100a + 10b + c.\]

The decimal representation of \(\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\,\underline{a}_{\,\text{nine}}\) is:
\[81b + 9c + a.\]

Since these two expressions represent the same number, we can set them equal to each other:
\[100a + 10b + c = 81b + 9c + a.\]

Rearranging terms, we get:
\[99a - 71b - 8c = 0.\]

This simplifies to:
\[99a = 71b + 8c.\]

Since \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are digits (i.e., integers between 0 and 8 for \(b\) and \(c\), and 1 and 8 for \(a\) because \(\underline{a}\,\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\) is a three-digit number), we need to find values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) that satisfy this equation. We will test possible values for \(a\) starting from the smallest possible value.

If \(a = 1\):
\[99 = 71b + 8c.\]
We need to find integer solutions for \(b\) and \(c\). Testing values for \(b\):
- If \(b = 1\), then \(99 = 71 + 8c \implies 28 = 8c \implies c = 3.5\) (not an integer).
- If \(b = 2\), then \(99 = 142 + 8c \implies -43 = 8c\) (not possible since \(c\) must be non-negative).
- If \(b = 3\), then \(99 = 213 + 8c \implies -114 = 8c\) (not possible).

If \(a = 2\):
\[198 = 71b + 8c.\]
Testing values for \(b\):
- If \(b = 2\), then \(198 = 142 + 8c \implies 56 = 8c \implies c = 7\).

So, \(a = 2\), \(b = 2\), and \(c = 7\) is a solution. We can verify this solution:
The number in decimal is \(227\).
In base nine, \(227_{\text{nine}} = 2 \cdot 81 + 2 \cdot 9 + 7 = 162 + 18 + 7 = 187\), but we need to check the original representation:
\[227_{\text{decimal}} = 2 \cdot 100 + 2 \cdot 10 + 7 = 200 + 20 + 7 = 227.\]
And in base nine, \(227_{\text{nine}} = 2 \cdot 81 + 2 \cdot 9 + 7 = 162 + 18 + 7 = 187\), which is incorrect. We need to recheck the calculations.
