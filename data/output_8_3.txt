 The problem: 
In isosceles trapezoid $ABCD$, parallel bases $\overline{AB}$ and $\overline{CD}$ have lengths $500$ and $650$, respectively, and $AD=BC=333$. The angle bisectors of $\angle{A}$ and $\angle{D}$ meet at $P$, and the angle bisectors of $\angle{B}$ and $\angle{C}$ meet at $Q$. Find $PQ$.


To find the length \(PQ\) in the given isosceles trapezoid \(ABCD\), we start by analyzing the geometry of the trapezoid. The bases \(AB\) and \(CD\) are parallel with lengths 500 and 650 respectively, and the non-parallel sides \(AD\) and \(BC\) are both 333. We need to find the height of the trapezoid, which will help us determine the coordinates of points \(P\) and \(Q\).

First, drop perpendiculars from points \(A\) and \(B\) to line \(CD\), meeting \(CD\) at points \(E\) and \(F\) respectively. This creates two right triangles \(ADE\) and \(BCF\) with \(DE = CF\) and \(EF = AB = 500\). Since \(CD = 650\), we have:
\[DE + EF + CF = CD \implies DE + 500 + DE = 650 \implies 2DE = 150 \implies DE = 75.\]
So, \(DE = CF = 75\).

Now, consider the right triangle \(ADE\). Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the height \(h\) of the trapezoid:
\[AD^2 = DE^2 + h^2 \implies 333^2 = 75^2 + h^2 \implies 110889 = 5625 + h^2 \implies h^2 = 105264 \implies h = \sqrt{105264} = 324.\]
Thus, the height of the trapezoid is 324.

Next, we need to find the coordinates of points \(P\) and \(Q\). Since \(P\) and \(Q\) are the intersections of the angle bisectors of the trapezoid, they lie on the midsegment of the trapezoid, which is parallel to the bases and has a length equal to the average of the lengths of the bases:
\[\text{Midsegment length} = \frac{AB + CD}{2} = \frac{500 + 650}{2} = 575.\]
The midsegment is centered between the bases, so its length is 575 and it is parallel to the bases. The distance from the midsegment to each base is half the height of the trapezoid, which is 162.

Since \(P\) and \(Q\) are on the midsegment, the distance \(PQ\) is the same as the length of the midsegment because the angle bisectors of the angles at the bases intersect on the midsegment at the same vertical level. Therefore, the length \(PQ\) is simply the length of the midsegment:
\[PQ = 575.\]

Thus, the length \(PQ\) is \(\boxed{324}\). However, upon re-evaluating the problem, we realize that the correct interpretation of the problem's solution involves the fact that \(P\) and \(Q\) are not necessarily on the midsegment but rather at the same vertical level due to the symmetry and properties of the isosceles trapezoid. The correct approach is to recognize that \(P\) and \(Q\) are the points where the angle bisectors intersect the midsegment, and the distance between these points is the same as the height of the trapezoid, which is 324. Therefore, the correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{324}
\]
