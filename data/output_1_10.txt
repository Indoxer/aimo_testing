 The problem: 
Three spheres with radii $11$, $13$, and $19$ are mutually externally tangent. A plane intersects the spheres in three congruent circles centered at $A$, $B$, and $C$, respectively, and the centers of the spheres all lie on the same side of this plane. Suppose that $AB^2 = 560$. Find $AC^2$.


To solve the problem, we need to determine the distance between the centers of the spheres and use the given information about the distances between the centers of the circles formed by the plane intersecting the spheres.

First, let's denote the centers of the spheres as \( O_1 \), \( O_2 \), and \( O_3 \) with radii \( r_1 = 11 \), \( r_2 = 13 \), and \( r_3 = 19 \) respectively. The distance between the centers of the spheres is the sum of their radii because they are mutually externally tangent:
\[
O_1O_2 = r_1 + r_2 = 11 + 13 = 24,
\]
\[
O_2O_3 = r_2 + r_3 = 13 + 19 = 32,
\]
\[
O_1O_3 = r_1 + r_3 = 11 + 19 = 30.
\]

Next, we know that the plane intersects the spheres in three congruent circles centered at \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) respectively. The distance between the centers of these circles is given by \( AB^2 = 560 \). Since the circles are congruent, the distance between the centers of the circles is the same as the distance between the points where the plane intersects the line segments joining the centers of the spheres. This distance can be related to the radii of the spheres and the distances between their centers.

The distance \( O_1O_2 \) can be split into two parts: the distance between the centers of the circles \( AB \) and the perpendicular distance from \( O_1 \) to the plane. Let's denote the perpendicular distance from \( O_1 \) to the plane as \( d_1 \), from \( O_2 \) to the plane as \( d_2 \), and from \( O_3 \) to the plane as \( d_3 \). Then, we have:
\[
O_1A = \sqrt{r_1^2 - d_1^2} = \sqrt{11^2 - d_1^2},
\]
\[
O_2B = \sqrt{r_2^2 - d_2^2} = \sqrt{13^2 - d_2^2},
\]
\[
O_3C = \sqrt{r_3^2 - d_3^2} = \sqrt{19^2 - d_3^2}.
\]

Since the circles are congruent, the distances \( AB \), \( BC \), and \( CA \) are equal. We are given that \( AB^2 = 560 \). Using the Pythagorean theorem in the plane perpendicular to the line joining the centers of the spheres, we can express \( AB \) in terms of the distances between the centers of the spheres and the perpendicular distances from the centers to the plane. Specifically, we have:
\[
AB^2 = (O_1O_2)^2 - (d_1 - d_2)^2 = 24^2 - (d_1 - d_2)^2 = 576 - (d_1 - d_2)^2 = 560.
\]
This implies:
\[
(d_1 - d_2)^2 = 16 \implies d_1 - d_2 = 4 \text{ or } d_1 - d_2 = -4.
\]
Similarly, we can find the other differences:
\[
BC^2 = (O_2O_3)^2 - (d_2 - d_3)^2 = 32^2 - (d_2 - d_3)^2 = 1024 - (d_2 - d_3)^2 = 560.
\]
This implies:
\[
(d_2 - d_3)^2 = 464 \implies d_2 - d_3 = \sqrt{464} \text{ or } d_2 - d_3 = -\sqrt{464}.
\]
And:
\[
CA^2 = (O_3O_1)^2 - (d_3 - d_1)^2 = 30^2 - (d_3 - d_1)^2 = 900 - (d_3 - d_1)^2 = 560.
\]
This implies:
\[
(d_3 - d_1)^2 = 340 \implies d_3 - d_1 = \sqrt{340} \text{ or } d_3 - d_1 = -\sqrt{340}.
\]

Finally, we need to find \( AC^2 \):
\[
AC^2 = (O_1O_3)^2 - (d_1 - d_3)^2 = 30^2 - (d_1 - d_3)^2 = 900 - (d_1 - d_3)^2.
\]
Since \( d_1 - d_3 = \pm \sqrt{340} \), we have:
\[
(d_1 - d_3)^2 = 340 \implies AC^2 = 900 - 340 = 560.
\]

Thus, the value of \( AC^2 \) is:
\[
\boxed{560}.
