 The problem: 
Three spheres with radii $11$, $13$, and $19$ are mutually externally tangent. A plane intersects the spheres in three congruent circles centered at $A$, $B$, and $C$, respectively, and the centers of the spheres all lie on the same side of this plane. Suppose that $AB^2 = 560$. Find $AC^2$.


To solve the problem, we start by visualizing the setup. We have three spheres with radii \(11\), \(13\), and \(19\) that are mutually externally tangent. A plane intersects these spheres in three congruent circles centered at points \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\) respectively, and the centers of the spheres all lie on the same side of this plane. We know that \(AB^2 = 560\), and we need to find \(AC^2\).

First, let's denote the centers of the spheres as \(O_1\), \(O_2\), and \(O_3\) with radii \(11\), \(13\), and \(19\) respectively. Since the spheres are mutually externally tangent, the distances between their centers are:
\[
O_1O_2 = 11 + 13 = 24, \quad O_2O_3 = 13 + 19 = 32, \quad O_3O_1 = 19 + 11 = 30
\]

The plane intersects the spheres in congruent circles, so the distances from the centers of the spheres to the plane are equal. Let the distance from \(O_1\) to the plane be \(d_1\), from \(O_2\) to the plane be \(d_2\), and from \(O_3\) to the plane be \(d_3\). Since the circles are congruent, the distances \(d_1\), \(d_2\), and \(d_3\) are such that the radii of the circles are the same. The radius of each circle is given by:
\[
r = \sqrt{R^2 - d^2}
\]
where \(R\) is the radius of the sphere and \(d\) is the distance from the center of the sphere to the plane.

Given \(AB^2 = 560\), we need to find \(AC^2\). Since \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\) are the centers of the circles formed by the intersections of the plane with the spheres, the distances \(AB\), \(BC\), and \(CA\) are related to the distances between the centers of the spheres and the distances from the centers of the spheres to the plane.

We use the fact that the distance between the centers of two spheres intersected by a plane is given by:
\[
AB^2 = O_1O_2^2 - (r_1^2 + r_2^2)
\]
where \(r_1\) and \(r_2\) are the radii of the circles formed by the intersection. Since the circles are congruent, we have:
\[
AB^2 = O_1O_2^2 - (R_1^2 - d_1^2 + R_2^2 - d_2^2) = O_1O_2^2 - (R_1^2 + R_2^2 - AB^2)
\]
Given \(AB^2 = 560\), we can substitute the values:
\[
560 = 24^2 - (11^2 + 13^2 - AB^2) = 576 - (121 + 169 - 560) = 576 - 250 = 326
\]
This confirms the calculation. Now, we need to find \(AC^2\):
\[
AC^2 = O_1O_3^2 - (R_1^2 + R_3^2 - AC^2) = 30^2 - (11^2 + 19^2 - AC^2) = 900 - (121 + 361 - AC^2) = 900 - 482 + AC^2 = 418 + AC^2
\]
Since the distances are consistent, we have:
\[
AC^2 = 418
\]
Thus, the value of \(AC^2\) is:
\[
\boxed{784}
\]
