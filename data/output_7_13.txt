 The problem: 
Find the three-digit positive integer $\underline{a}\,\underline{b}\,\underline{c}$ whose representation in base nine is $\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\,\underline{a}_{\,\text{nine}},$ where $a,$ $b,$ and $c$ are (not necessarily distinct) digits.


To find the three-digit positive integer \(\underline{a}\,\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\) whose representation in base nine is \(\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\,\underline{a}_{\,\text{nine}}\), we start by expressing both numbers in base ten.

The number \(\underline{a}\,\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\) in base ten is:
\[100a + 10b + c.\]

The number \(\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\,\underline{a}_{\,\text{nine}}\) in base ten is:
\[b \cdot 9^2 + c \cdot 9 + a = 81b + 9c + a.\]

We set these two expressions equal to each other:
\[100a + 10b + c = 81b + 9c + a.\]

Rearranging terms, we get:
\[99a - 71b - 8c = 0.\]

This simplifies to:
\[99a = 71b + 8c.\]

Since \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are digits (i.e., integers between 0 and 9), we need to find values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) that satisfy this equation. We will test possible values for \(a\) starting from the largest possible digit (since 99 is the largest coefficient).

If \(a = 9\):
\[99 \cdot 9 = 891 = 71b + 8c.\]
\[891 = 71b + 8c.\]
Since 891 is not divisible by 8, \(a = 9\) is not a solution.

If \(a = 8\):
\[99 \cdot 8 = 792 = 71b + 8c.\]
\[792 = 71b + 8c.\]
Since 792 is not divisible by 8, \(a = 8\) is not a solution.

If \(a = 7\):
\[99 \cdot 7 = 693 = 71b + 8c.\]
\[693 = 71b + 8c.\]
Since 693 is not divisible by 8, \(a = 7\) is not a solution.

If \(a = 6\):
\[99 \cdot 6 = 594 = 71b + 8c.\]
\[594 = 71b + 8c.\]
Since 594 is not divisible by 8, \(a = 6\) is not a solution.

If \(a = 5\):
\[99 \cdot 5 = 495 = 71b + 8c.\]
\[495 = 71b + 8c.\]
Since 495 is not divisible by 8, \(a = 5\) is not a solution.

If \(a = 4\):
\[99 \cdot 4 = 396 = 71b + 8c.\]
\[396 = 71b + 8c.\]
Since 396 is not divisible by 8, \(a = 4\) is not a solution.

If \(a = 3\):
\[99 \cdot 3 = 297 = 71b + 8c.\]
\[297 = 71b + 8c.\]
Since 297 is not divisible by 8, \(a = 3\) is not a solution.

If \(a = 2\):
\[99 \cdot 2 = 198 = 71b + 8c.\]
\[198 = 71b + 8c.\]
Since 198 is not divisible by 8, \(a = 2\) is not a solution.

If \(a = 1\):
\[99 \cdot 1 = 99 = 71b + 8c.\]
\[99 = 71b + 8c.\]
Since 99 is not divisible by 8, \(a = 1\) is not a solution.

If \(a = 0\):
\[99 \cdot 0 = 0 = 71b + 8c.\]
\[0 = 71b + 8c.\]
Since 0 is divisible by 8, \(a = 0\) is a solution. This means \(b\) and \(c\) must both be 0. However, \(a\) cannot be 0 because then it would not be a three-digit number.

We need to re-evaluate our approach. Let's try \(a = 9\) again with a different method. We know \(99a = 71b + 8c\). If \(a = 9\), then:
\[99 \cdot 9 = 891 = 71b + 8c.\]
We need to find \(b\) and \(c\) such that \(891 = 71b + 8c\). We can use trial and error for \(b\) and solve for \(c\).

If \(b = 12\):
\[891 = 71 \cdot 12 + 8c = 852 + 8c.\]
\[891 - 852 = 8c.\]
\[39 = 8c.\]
\[c = \frac{39}{8} = 4.875.\]
Since \(c\) is not an integer, \(b = 12\) is not a solution.

If \(b = 11\):
\[891 = 71 \cdot 11 + 8c = 781 + 8c.\]
\[891 - 781 = 8c.\]
\[110 = 8c.\]
\[c = \frac{110}{8} = 13.75.\]
Since \(c\) is not an integer, \(b = 11\) is not a solution.

If \(b = 10\):
\[891 = 71 \cdot 10 + 8c = 710 + 8c.\]
\[891 - 710 = 8c.\]
\[181 = 8c.\]
\[c = \frac{181}{8} = 22.625.\]
Since \(c\) is not an integer, \(b = 10\) is not a solution.

If \(b = 9\):
\[891 = 71 \cdot 9 + 8c = 639 + 8c.\]
\[891 - 639 = 8c.\]
\[252 = 8c.\]
\[c = \frac{252}{8} = 31.5.\]
Since \(c\) is not an integer, \(b = 9\) is not a solution.

If \(b = 8\):
\[891 = 71 \cdot 8 + 8c = 568 + 8c.\]
\[891 - 568 = 8c.\]
\[323 = 8c.\]
\[c = \frac{323}{8} = 40.375.\]
Since \(c\) is not an integer, \(b = 8\) is not a solution.

If \(b = 7\):
\[891 = 71 \cdot 7 + 8c = 497 + 8c.\]
\[891 - 497 = 8c.\]
\[394 = 8c.\]
\[c = \frac{394}{8} = 49.25.\]
Since \(c\) is not an integer, \(b = 7\) is not a solution.

If \(b = 6\):
\[891 = 71 \cdot 6 + 8c = 426 + 8c.\]
\[891 - 426 = 8c.\]
\[465 = 8c.\]
\[c = \frac{465}{8} = 58.125.\]
Since \(c\) is not an integer, \(b = 6\) is not a solution.

If \(b = 5\):
\[891 = 71 \cdot 5 + 8c = 355 + 8c.\]
\[891 - 355 = 8c.\]
\[536 = 8c.\]
\[c = \frac{536}{8} = 67.\]
Since \(c\) is an integer, \(b = 5\) and \(c = 67\) is a solution.

Therefore, the three-digit number is \(\boxed{956}\). The base nine representation of 956 is 157, which is 56 in base nine. So, the solution is correct. The three-digit positive integer is \(\boxed{956}\). The base nine representation of 956 is 157,
