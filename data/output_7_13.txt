 The problem: 
Find the three-digit positive integer $\underline{a}\,\underline{b}\,\underline{c}$ whose representation in base nine is $\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\,\underline{a}_{\,\text{nine}},$ where $a,$ $b,$ and $c$ are (not necessarily distinct) digits.


To solve the problem, we need to find a three-digit number \(\underline{a}\,\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\) such that its representation in base nine is \(\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\,\underline{a}_{\,\text{nine}}\). Let's denote the number in decimal form as \(100a + 10b + c\). In base nine, the same number is represented as \(81b + 9c + a\). Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[100a + 10b + c = 81b + 9c + a.\]

Rearranging the terms, we get:

\[100a - a + 10b - 81b + c - 9c = 0,\]
\[99a - 71b - 8c = 0.\]

This simplifies to:

\[99a = 71b + 8c.\]

Since \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are digits (i.e., integers between 0 and 9), we need to find values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) that satisfy this equation. Let's test possible values for \(a\):

1. If \(a = 1\):
   \[99 = 71b + 8c.\]
   We need to find integer values for \(b\) and \(c\) such that \(71b + 8c = 99\). Testing values for \(b\):
   - If \(b = 1\), then \(71 + 8c = 99 \implies 8c = 28 \implies c = 3.5\) (not an integer).
   - If \(b = 0\), then \(8c = 99\) (not an integer).

2. If \(a = 2\):
   \[198 = 71b + 8c.\]
   Testing values for \(b\):
   - If \(b = 2\), then \(142 + 8c = 198 \implies 8c = 56 \implies c = 7\).
   - If \(b = 1\), then \(71 + 8c = 198 \implies 8c = 127\) (not an integer).
   - If \(b = 0\), then \(8c = 198\) (not an integer).

So, the only solution is \(a = 2\), \(b = 2\), and \(c = 7\). Therefore, the three-digit number is \(227\).

To verify, we convert \(227\) to base nine:
\[227_{10} = 2 \cdot 81 + 2 \cdot 9 + 7 = 227_9.\]
The representation in base nine is indeed \(227_9\), which matches the form \(\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\,\underline{a}_{\,\text{nine}} = 272_9\).

Thus, the three-digit positive integer is \(\boxed{227}\).
