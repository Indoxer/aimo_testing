 The problem: 
Let $S$ be the set of all rational numbers that can be expressed as a repeating decimal in the form $0.\overline{abcd},$ where at least one of the digits $a,$ $b,$ $c,$ or $d$ is nonzero. Let $N$ be the number of distinct numerators obtained when numbers in $S$ are written as fractions in lowest terms. For example, both $4$ and $410$ are counted among the distinct numerators for numbers in $S$ because $0.\overline{3636} = \frac{4}{11}$ and $0.\overline{1230} = \frac{410}{3333}.$ Find the remainder when $N$ is divided by $1000.$


To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of distinct numerators when rational numbers in the set \( S \) are written as fractions in lowest terms. The set \( S \) consists of all rational numbers that can be expressed as a repeating decimal in the form \( 0.\overline{abcd} \), where at least one of the digits \( a, b, c, d \) is nonzero.

First, let's express a repeating decimal \( 0.\overline{abcd} \) as a fraction. A repeating decimal \( 0.\overline{abcd} \) can be written as:
\[
0.\overline{abcd} = \frac{abcd}{9999}
\]
where \( abcd \) represents the four-digit number formed by the digits \( a, b, c, \) and \( d \).

Next, we need to consider the fraction \( \frac{abcd}{9999} \) in its lowest terms. To do this, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \( abcd \) and \( 9999 \). The number \( 9999 \) can be factored into prime factors:
\[
9999 = 3^2 \times 11 \times 101
\]

For \( \frac{abcd}{9999} \) to be in its lowest terms, \( abcd \) must not share any common factors with \( 9999 \) other than 1. Therefore, \( abcd \) must be coprime with \( 9999 \).

We need to count the number of four-digit numbers \( abcd \) that are coprime with \( 9999 \). A four-digit number ranges from 1000 to 9999. We will use Euler's Totient Function \( \phi(n) \) to count the number of integers up to \( n \) that are coprime with \( n \).

First, we calculate \( \phi(9999) \):
\[
\phi(9999) = 9999 \left(1 - \frac{1}{3}\right)\left(1 - \frac{1}{11}\right)\left(1 - \frac{1}{101}\right)
\]
\[
= 9999 \times \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{10}{11} \times \frac{100}{101}
\]
\[
= 9999 \times \frac{2000}{3333}
\]
\[
= 6000
\]

Thus, there are 6000 four-digit numbers that are coprime with 9999. However, we need to exclude the cases where \( abcd = 0 \), which is not possible since \( a, b, c, \) and \( d \) are nonzero. Therefore, all 6000 numbers are valid.

Finally, we need to find the remainder when \( N = 6000 \) is divided by 1000:
\[
6000 \mod 1000 = 0
\]

Thus, the remainder when \( N \) is divided by 1000 is:
\[
\boxed{0}
\]
