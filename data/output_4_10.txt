 The problem: 
Let $S$ be the set of all rational numbers that can be expressed as a repeating decimal in the form $0.\overline{abcd},$ where at least one of the digits $a,$ $b,$ $c,$ or $d$ is nonzero. Let $N$ be the number of distinct numerators obtained when numbers in $S$ are written as fractions in lowest terms. For example, both $4$ and $410$ are counted among the distinct numerators for numbers in $S$ because $0.\overline{3636} = \frac{4}{11}$ and $0.\overline{1230} = \frac{410}{3333}.$ Find the remainder when $N$ is divided by $1000.$


To solve the problem, we need to understand the structure of the repeating decimals and their corresponding fractions. A repeating decimal of the form \(0.\overline{abcd}\) can be expressed as a fraction. Specifically, if \(x = 0.\overline{abcd}\), then

\[ x = \frac{abcd}{9999}, \]

where \(abcd\) represents the four-digit number formed by the digits \(a, b, c, d\). Since \(abcd\) can range from 0000 to 9999, there are 10000 possible values for \(abcd\). However, we need to consider only those numbers where at least one of the digits is nonzero, which means we exclude the case where \(abcd = 0000\). Therefore, there are \(10000 - 1 = 9999\) possible values for \(abcd\).

Next, we need to determine how many distinct numerators appear when these fractions are in their lowest terms. This requires us to count the number of integers from 1 to 9999 that are relatively prime to 9999. The number 9999 can be factored as \(9999 = 3^2 \times 11 \times 101\). Using Euler's totient function \(\phi(n)\), which counts the number of integers up to \(n\) that are relatively prime to \(n\), we have:

\[ \phi(9999) = 9999 \left(1 - \frac{1}{3}\right)\left(1 - \frac{1}{11}\right)\left(1 - \frac{1}{101}\right) = 9999 \cdot \frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{10}{11} \cdot \frac{100}{101} = 6000. \]

Thus, there are 6000 integers from 1 to 9999 that are relatively prime to 9999. Therefore, the number of distinct numerators obtained when numbers in \(S\) are written as fractions in lowest terms is 6000. We need to find the remainder when 6000 is divided by 1000, which is simply 0.

The answer is:

\[
