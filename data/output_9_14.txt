 The problem: 
Let $w = \dfrac{\sqrt{3} + i}{2}$ and $z = \dfrac{-1 + i\sqrt{3}}{2},$ where $i = \sqrt{-1}.$ Find the number of ordered pairs $(r,s)$ of positive integers not exceeding $100$ that satisfy the equation $i \cdot w^r = z^s.$


To solve the given problem, we start by expressing \( w \) and \( z \) in polar form. Notice that \( w \) and \( z \) are complex numbers that can be written as:
\[ w = \frac{\sqrt{3} + i}{2} = \cos \frac{\pi}{6} + i \sin \frac{\pi}{6} = e^{i \pi / 6} \]
\[ z = \frac{-1 + i \sqrt{3}}{2} = \cos \frac{2\pi}{3} + i \sin \frac{2\pi}{3} = e^{i 2\pi / 3} \]

We need to find the ordered pairs \((r, s)\) such that:
\[ i \cdot w^r = z^s \]
Substituting the polar forms, we get:
\[ i \cdot e^{i \pi / 6 \cdot r} = e^{i 2\pi / 3 \cdot s} \]
Since \( i = e^{i \pi / 2} \), we can rewrite the left side as:
\[ e^{i \pi / 2} \cdot e^{i \pi / 6 \cdot r} = e^{i (\pi / 2 + \pi / 6 \cdot r)} \]
So the equation becomes:
\[ e^{i (\pi / 2 + \pi / 6 \cdot r)} = e^{i 2\pi / 3 \cdot s} \]
This implies that the exponents must differ by an integer multiple of \( 2\pi \):
\[ \frac{\pi}{2} + \frac{\pi}{6} r = \frac{2\pi}{3} s + 2k\pi \]
for some integer \( k \). Dividing through by \( \pi \), we get:
\[ \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{6} r = \frac{2}{3} s + 2k \]
Multiplying through by 6 to clear the denominators, we obtain:
\[ 3 + r = 4s + 12k \]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[ r - 4s = 12k - 3 \]
This is a linear Diophantine equation. To find solutions, we need to find particular solutions and then the general solution. One particular solution is \( r = 3 \) and \( s = 1 \) (when \( k = 0 \)). The general solution is:
\[ r = 3 + 12m \]
\[ s = 1 + 3m \]
for any integer \( m \). We need \( r \) and \( s \) to be positive integers not exceeding 100. So we have:
\[ 1 \leq 3 + 12m \leq 100 \]
\[ 1 \leq 1 + 3m \leq 100 \]
Solving these inequalities, we get:
\[ -\frac{2}{12} \leq m \leq \frac{97}{12} \]
\[ 0 \leq m \leq \frac{99}{3} \]
So:
\[ 0 \leq m \leq 8 \]
Thus, \( m \) can take any integer value from 0 to 8, inclusive. This gives us 9 possible values for \( m \), and hence 9 ordered pairs \((r, s)\).

Therefore, the number of ordered pairs \((r, s)\) is:
\[ \boxed{9} \]
