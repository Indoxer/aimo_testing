 The problem: 
Find the number of ways to place a digit in each cell of a 2x3 grid so that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is $999$, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is $99$. The grid below is an example of such an arrangement because $8+991=999$ and $9+9+81=99$.
\[\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline 0 & 0 & 8 \\ \hline 9 & 9 & 1 \\ \hline \end{array}\]


To solve this, you need to find the number of solutions to the system:
\[
\begin{cases}
a + b + c = 999 \\
d + e + f = 99
\end{cases}
\]
where \( a, b, c \) are digits from 0 to 9 arranged horizontally, and \( d, e, f \) are digits from 0 to 9 arranged vertically. Each cell must contain exactly one digit.

Wait, no, actually, each cell must contain exactly one digit, but the digits can be repeated.

Wait, let me correct myself: each cell must contain exactly one digit, but the digits can be repeated as long as they satisfy the given sums.

But actually, hold on, the problem says "place a digit in each cell," so it's not necessarily unique. So digits can repeat.

So, the problem is to count the number of 2x3 grids where:

- The first row forms a 1-digit, then another 1-digit, then another 1-digit, which when read left to right as a number (so for example, if the row is [a,b,c], it's interpreted as the number 100a + 10b + c). Similarly, the second row forms another number.

- The sum of these two numbers is 999.

- The columns, when read top to bottom, form three separate 2-digit numbers (since it's a 2x3 grid, each column has two cells, so interpreting top to bottom gives a two-digit number). The sum of these three numbers is 99.

Wait, hold on, the initial problem statement was a bit unclear. Wait, in the example given:

First row: 0, 0, 8. Second row: 9, 9, 1.

So reading left to right, the first row is 008, which is 8, and the second row is 991, so 8 + 991 = 999.

Reading top to bottom, each column is 09, 09, 81. So 09 is 9, 09 is 9, 81 is 81; 9 + 9 + 81 = 99.

Therefore, more precisely:

Each row is a 3-digit number, with leading zeros allowed. So the first row is a 3-digit number ABC, the second row is DEF. Their sum is ABC + DEF = 999.

Each column is a 2-digit number, so first column is AD, second column is BE, third column is CF. Their sum is AD + BE + CF = 99.

We have to count the number of such grids where both conditions are satisfied.

Given that, let's formalize the variables:

Let’s denote the grid as follows:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
A & B & C \\
\hline
D & E & F \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

Where A,B,C,D,E,F are digits (0-9). Note that leading zeros are allowed, since numbers like 09 or 008 are considered as 9 and 8 respectively.

So, the first condition is:

ABC + DEF = 999

Which translates to:

100A + 10B + C + 100D + 10E + F = 999

The second condition is:

AD + BE + CF = 99

Which translates to:

(10A + D) + (10B + E) + (10C + F) = 99

Simplify the second equation:

10A + D + 10B + E + 10C + F = 99

Grouping terms:

10(A + B + C) + (D + E + F) = 99

Let’s denote S = A + B + C and T = D + E + F.

Then, the second equation becomes:

10S + T = 99

So, we have T = 99 - 10S.

Since S and T are sums of digits, their possible ranges are:

For S: A, B, C are digits (0-9), so minimum S is 0 + 0 + 0 = 0, maximum S is 9 + 9 + 9 = 27.

Similarly, T is the sum of D, E, F: same range 0 to 27.

From T = 99 - 10S, since T must be non-negative, 99 - 10S ≥ 0 => S ≤ 9.9, so S ≤ 9.

Also, since T must be less than or equal to 27 (as D, E, F are digits):

T = 99 - 10S ≤ 27 => 99 - 27 ≤ 10S => 72 ≤ 10S => S ≥ 7.2, so S ≥ 8.

Thus, S must satisfy 8 ≤ S ≤ 9.

So, possible values for S are 8 and 9.

Case 1: S = 8

Then, T = 99 - 10*8 = 99 - 80 = 19

Case 2: S = 9

Then, T = 99 - 10*9 = 99 - 90 = 9

So now, we have two cases to consider:

Case 1: S = 8, T = 19

Case 2: S = 9, T = 9

For each case, we need to find the number of solutions for:

In Case 1:

A + B + C = 8

D + E + F = 19

And also, from the first condition:

100A + 10B + C + 100D + 10E + F = 999

But wait, let's see if we can express this equation in terms of S and T.

Wait, 100A + 10B + C = ABC, similarly 100D + 10E + F = DEF.

So ABC + DEF = 999.

But ABC is a 3-digit number, so its value is between 0 and 999, same for DEF.

Moreover, ABC + DEF = 999.

But ABC = 100A + 10B + C

DEF = 100D + 10E + F

So,

100A + 10B + C + 100D + 10E + F = 999

But note that from the second condition, we have:

10(A + B + C) + (D + E + F) = 99

Which is 10S + T = 99, which we already used.

Is there a way to link ABC + DEF with S and T?

Alternatively, perhaps we can write ABC + DEF = 999 in terms of A, B, C, D, E, F.

But maybe not necessary. Perhaps instead, for each case of S and T, we can compute the number of possible triples (A,B,C) and (D,E,F) that satisfy A+B+C=S and D+E+F=T, and then check whether ABC + DEF = 999.

But this might involve some computation. Alternatively, perhaps we can find constraints based on the digits.

Wait, let's think about ABC + DEF = 999.

Note that ABC is a 3-digit number, so ABC can be from 0 to 999. Similarly, DEF can be from 0 to 999, but since their sum is 999, DEF = 999 - ABC.

Therefore, DEF must be 999 - ABC, which is also a 3-digit number.

But DEF must be a 3-digit number or could it be a 2-digit number? Wait, DEF is a 3-digit number because it's formed by three digits, so leading zeros are allowed, making it effectively a number from 0 to 999.

But in reality, DEF is a 3-digit string, but its numerical value is 100D + 10E + F.

Similarly, ABC is 100A + 10B + C.

So, ABC + DEF = 999 implies:

100A + 10B + C + 100D + 10E + F = 999

But 100A + 100D = 100(A + D)

10B + 10E = 10(B + E)

C + F = ?

So, 100(A + D) + 10(B + E) + (C + F) = 999

But 999 in digits is 9 hundreds, 9 tens, and 9 units.

Therefore, we can equate the coefficients:

100(A + D) + 10(B + E) + (C + F) = 999

So, matching digits:

Hundreds place: A + D must contribute to 9 hundreds. But note that A and D are single digits, so A + D can be at most 9 + 9 = 18, but since it's multiplied by 100, it can produce up to 1800, which is too much. Wait, but 100(A + D) is part of the total sum, so 100(A + D) can only contribute up to 900, because 100*9=900.

But 100(A + D) + 10(B + E) + (C + F) = 999

So, let's break down the sum into hundreds, tens, and units:

The hundreds place: 100*(A + D) contributes to the hundreds digit. However, 100*(A + D) will be a multiple of 100, so it affects the hundreds digit directly.

Similarly, 10*(B + E) affects the tens digit, and (C + F) affects the units digit.

But 999 is 9 hundreds, 9 tens, 9 units.

Therefore, we have:

100*(A + D) + 10*(B + E) + (C + F) = 999

So, equating digit-wise:

Units place: C + F = 9 (since 999 has 9 in the units place). However, considering possible carryover from the tens place.

Wait, actually, this is not straightforward because addition can cause carryovers.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently.

Let’s consider adding ABC and DEF as numbers:

ABC
+DEF
=999

Adding digit by digit, starting from the units place:

C + F = 9 or 19 (if there's a carryover of 1)

Similarly, moving to tens place:

B + E + carryover = 9 or 19

And hundreds place:

A + D + carryover = 9

But since we're dealing with digits, the maximum possible sum in any place is 9 + 9 = 18, so carryover can only be 0 or 1.

Wait, let's structure this properly.

Let’s denote:

- Units place: C + F = 9 + 10*k1, where k1 is 0 or 1 (carryover to tens place)

- Tens place: B + E + k1 = 9 + 10*k2, where k2 is 0 or 1 (carryover to hundreds place)

- Hundreds place: A + D + k2 = 9

Because the total sum is 999, which has 9 in each place.

So, starting from the units place:

1. Units place:

C + F = 9 + 10*k1

Possible k1: 0 or 1.

If k1 = 0: C + F = 9

If k1 = 1: C + F = 19

But since C and F are digits (0-9), the maximum C + F can be 18 (9+9). Therefore, k1 cannot be 2, so only k1=0 or 1.

2. Tens place:

B + E + k1 = 9 + 10*k2

Again, k2 can be 0 or 1.

If k2 = 0: B + E + k1 = 9

If k2 = 1: B + E + k1 = 19

But B, E are digits (0-9), so B + E can be at most 18, so B + E + k1 can be at most 18 +1=19.

Hence, k2 can be 0 or 1.

3. Hundreds place:

A + D + k2 = 9

Here, A and D are digits (0-9), so A + D can be 0-18, but with k2 being 0 or 1, A + D can be 9 - k2.

So, A + D can be either 9 - 0 = 9, or 9 -1 = 8.

Therefore, depending on k2:

If k2=0: A + D =9

If k2=1: A + D=8

Now, let's analyze possible scenarios based on k1 and k2.

Case 1: From hundreds place, k2 can be 0 or 1.

Subcase 1a: k2=0

Then, A + D =9

From tens place:

B + E + k1 =9

But k1 comes from units place: C + F=9 or 19.

If k1=0: Then B + E=9

If k1=1: Then B + E=8

But remember, k1 is determined by C + F.

So, Subcase 1a1: k1=0, k2=0

Then:

A + D=9

C + F=9

B + E=9

Subcase 1a2: k1=1, k2=0

Then:

A + D=9

C + F=19

B + E=8

Case 2: k2=1

Then, A + D=8

From tens place:

B + E +k1=19

But since k1 is either 0 or 1.

Subcase 2a: k1=0: Then B + E=19

But B and E are digits, so max B + E=18. Hence, impossible.

Subcase 2b: k1=1: Then B + E=18

Which is possible only if B=E=9

So, Subcase 2b: k2=1, k1=1

A + D=8

C + F=19

B + E=18 => B=E=9

So, compiling all possible subcases:

Total four subcases:

1. Subcase 1a1: A + D=9, C + F=9, B + E=9

2. Subcase 1a2: A + D=9, C + F=19, B + E=8

3. Subcase 2b: A + D=8, C + F=19, B + E=18

But Subcase 1a2: B + E=8, which is possible.

Similarly, Subcase 2b: B + E=18, which is only possible if both B and E are 9.

So, summarizing:

Our possible scenarios are:

1. A + D=9, C + F=9, B + E=9

2. A + D=9, C + F=19, B + E=8

3. A + D=8, C + F=19, B + E=18 (with B=E=9)

Additionally, recall that earlier, we had Cases 1 and 2 based on S=8 and S=9.

Case 1: S=8, T=19

Case 2: S=9, T=9

But now, in our current analysis, we have Subcases 1, 2, 3 above, which depend on different relationships.

Wait, perhaps we can connect these.

In Subcase 1: A + D=9, C + F=9, B + E=9

This would correspond to S = A + B + C = (A + D=9) but D is related to other variables.

Wait, perhaps we need to relate these.

Wait, no, perhaps better to go back.

Wait, S = A + B + C

T = D + E + F

In Subcase 1a1: A + D=9, C + F=9, B + E=9

Therefore, S = A + B + C

But A + D=9 => D=9 - A

Similarly, C + F=9 => F=9 - C

And B + E=9 => E=9 - B

Therefore, T = D + E + F = (9 - A) + (9 - B) + (9 - C) = 27 - (A + B + C) = 27 - S

But in Case 1, where S=8, T=19, 27 - S=19, which matches.

In Case 2, where S=9, T=9, 27 - S=18, which doesn't match T=9.

Wait, so in Subcase 1a1, we have S + T = 27, but in our original problem, S and T are constrained via the two equations.

Earlier, we found that when S=8, T=19, and when S=9, T=9.

So, Subcase 1a1 corresponds to S + T =27, but in our cases, when S=8, T=19, so S + T=27, which fits.

Similarly, when S=9, T=9, S + T=18≠27, so Subcase 1a1 only applies to Case 1 where S=8, T=19.

Wait, but Subcase 1a2: A + D=9, C + F=19, B + E=8

So, S = A + B + C

But A + D=9 => D=9 - A

C + F=19 => F=19 - C

B + E=8 => E=8 - B

Therefore, T = D + E + F = (9 - A) + (8 - B) + (19 - C) = 36 - (A + B + C) = 36 - S

But in Case 1, S=8, so T=36 - 8=28≠19, which contradicts T=19.

In Case 2, S=9, so T=36 -9=27≠9. Also, doesn't fit.

Wait, that suggests that Subcase 1a2 may not align with the previous constraints.

Wait, perhaps my approach is confusing.

Maybe instead, I should proceed step by step.

Let me try to map out the possible scenarios.

From the initial problem, we have two main cases based on S=8 and S=9.

Case 1: S=8, T=19

Case 2: S=9, T=9

Within each case, we have to satisfy the ABC + DEF=999 and also meet the T=19 or T=9.

Additionally, we have the digit sum constraints for each column.

So, perhaps it's better to handle each case separately.

Let me start with Case 1: S=8, T=19

So, A + B + C=8

D + E + F=19

And ABC + DEF=999

We need to find the number of grids where these conditions hold.

Similarly, in Case 2: S=9, T=9

A + B + C=9

D + E + F=9

And ABC + DEF=999

So, let's tackle Case 1 first.

Case 1: S=8, T=19

We need to find the number of 3x2 grids where:

A + B + C=8

D + E + F=19

and

100A + 10B + C + 100D + 10E + F=999

Let me express ABC + DEF=999 as:

100A + 10B + C + 100D + 10E + F=999

We can rewrite this as:

100(A + D) + 10(B + E) + (C + F)=999

So, similar to before, breaking down into hundreds, tens, and units.

As previously discussed:

- Units place: C + F must end with 9, possibly with a carryover.

But since 100(A + D) + 10(B + E) + (C + F)=999, which is 999.

So, in terms of digits:

- The units digit: C + F must be 9 or 19 (if there's a carryover from the tens place).

Wait, but hold on: 100(A + D) + 10(B + E) + (C + F) = 999.

Therefore, looking at the units place: C + F must equal 9 or 19 because the units digit of 999 is 9.

But wait, actually, 100(A + D) contributes to the hundreds place, 10(B + E) contributes to the tens place, and (C + F) contributes to the units place.

However, (C + F) can be greater than 10, causing a carryover to the tens place.

Similarly, 10(B + E) plus any carryover from the units place can cause another carryover to the hundreds place.

Therefore, let's define:

Let k1 be the carryover from units to tens: k1 = floor((C + F)/10)

Similarly, let k2 be the carryover from tens to hundreds: k2 = floor((10(B + E) + k1)/10)

Given that, the total sum:

100(A + D + k2) + 10(B + E + k1 - 10k2) + (C + F - 10k1) = 999

But since 999 is fixed, we can set up equations accordingly.

But this seems complicated. Maybe a better approach is to use algebraic manipulation.

Given that 100(A + D) + 10(B + E) + (C + F) = 999

We know that A + D, B + E, and C + F are integers, so:

Let x = A + D

y = B + E

z = C + F

Then, 100x + 10y + z = 999

With constraints:

x = A + D, where A, D are digits (0-9). So x can range from 0 to 18.

Similarly, y = B + E, B, E digits: y from 0 to 18.

z = C + F, C, F digits: z from 0 to 18.

But in addition, from the second condition:

D + E + F = T

In Case 1, T=19.

So, D + E + F=19.

But D, E, F are digits (0-9), so the maximum D + E + F=27, minimum=0.

19 is feasible.

Similarly, in Case 1, A + B + C=8.

So, A, B, C are digits with sum 8.

So, for both cases, we have to find the number of solutions to these equations.

Perhaps, rather than trying to solve it abstractly, we can fix variables step by step.

Starting with Case 1: S=8, T=19

So, A + B + C=8, D + E + F=19.

And 100x + 10y + z=999, where x=A+D, y=B+E, z=C+F.

We need to find x, y, z such that:

x + y + z is not directly constrained, but x, y, z must satisfy 100x +10y +z=999

Also, x, y, z must be consistent with A + B + C=8 and D + E + F=19.

But maybe we can find x, y, z.

From 100x + 10y + z=999, since x, y, z are integers between 0 and 18.

Looking at 999:

Divide 999 by 100: 9.99, so x can be at most 9.

But x is A + D, which can be up to 18, but in reality, since 100x <=999, x<=9.

So x must be 9, because 100*9=900, and 100*10=1000>999.

Therefore, x=9.

So, A + D=9

Then, substituting back:

100*9 +10y +z=999 => 900 +10y + z=999 =>10y +z=99

So, 10y + z=99.

But y and z are derived from y = B + E, z = C + F.

From A + D=9, and A + B + C=8, we have:

B + C=8 - A

Similarly, since D=9 - A, from A + D=9.

Also, D + E + F=19, so E + F=19 - D=19 - (9 - A)=10 + A

So, E + F=10 + A

But E + F can be at most 18, so 10 + A <=18 => A <=8

But A is a digit (0-9), so A can be from 0 to 8.

Similarly, since A + B + C=8, A can be from 0 to8.

So, A is in 0 to8, integer.

Similarly, B and C are digits such that B + C=8 - A.

Similarly, E and F are digits such that E + F=10 + A.

Also, from y = B + E and z = C + F.

From 10y + z=99, and z=99 -10y.

But z must be equal to C + F.

But z=99 -10y, so z must be between 0 and 18, as C + F is between 0 and18.

So, 99 -10y >=0 => y <=9.9, so y <=9.

Similarly, 99 -10y <=18 =>99 -18<=10y =>81<=10y =>y>=8.1, so y>=9.

Wait, 99 -10y <=18 =>10y >=81 => y>=8.1, but y is integer, so y>=9.

But y<=9, so y=9.

Therefore, y=9.

Thus, z=99 -10*9=9.

Therefore, y=9, z=9.

So, from y = B + E=9

And z = C + F=9

So, now, we have:

From A + D=9

From B + E=9

From C + F=9

From A + B + C=8

From D + E + F=19

But since D=9 - A, E=9 - B, F=9 - C

Therefore, D + E + F= (9 - A) + (9 - B) + (9 - C)=27 - (A + B + C)=27 -8=19

Which matches T=19.

Therefore, all the conditions are satisfied as long as:

A + B + C=8

And D=9 - A, E=9 - B, F=9 - C

With D, E, F being digits (0-9)

So, now, the problem reduces to finding the number of non-negative integer solutions to A + B + C=8, where A, B, C are digits (0-9). Since 8 is small, the constraints A, B, C <=9 are automatically satisfied.

Therefore, the number of solutions is the number of non-negative integer solutions to A + B + C=8, which is C(8 + 3 -1, 3 -1)=C(10,2)=45.

But wait, that's if A, B, C can be zero.

But in our problem, are A, B, C allowed to be zero? Yes, because digits can be 0.

So, 45 solutions.

But, however, D=9 - A, E=9 - B, F=9 - C must also be digits (0-9). Since A, B, C are digits, 0<=A, B, C<=9, so D=9 - A is between 0 and9, same for E and F.

Therefore, all solutions are valid.

Thus, in Case 1, the number of grids is 45.

Now, moving on to Case 2: S=9, T=9

So, A + B + C=9

D + E + F=9

And ABC + DEF=999

Expressed as:

100(A + D) + 10(B + E) + (C + F)=999

Again, x = A + D

y = B + E

z = C + F

So, 100x +10y + z=999

As before, x must be 9 because 100*9=900, 100*10=1000>999.

Thus, x=9 => A + D=9

Then, 10y + z=99

So, same as Case 1, y=9, z=9

Therefore, y=B + E=9

z=C + F=9

Therefore, similar to Case 1, D=9 - A, E=9 - B, F=9 - C

But in this case, A + B + C=9

And D + E + F=(9 - A)+(9 - B)+(9 - C)=27 - (A + B + C)=27 -9=18≠9

But in Case 2, T=9, so D + E + F=9

But according to the above, D + E + F=18≠9

Contradiction.

Wait, so something's wrong here.

Wait, because in Case 2, T=9, which is supposed to be D + E + F=9.

But according to the substitution, D + E + F=27 - (A + B + C)=27 -9=18, which conflicts with T=9.

Therefore, in Case 2, this leads to inconsistency, meaning that there are no solutions in Case 2.

Wait, that can't be right.

Wait, let me double-check.

From the setup:

In Case 2: S=9, T=9

So, A + B + C=9

D + E + F=9

But, from ABC + DEF=999, we have:

100(A + D) +10(B + E) + (C + F)=999

Which leads us to x=9, y=9, z=9

Therefore, A + D=9, B + E=9, C + F=9

So, D=9 - A, E=9 - B, F=9 - C

Therefore, D + E + F= (9 - A) + (9 - B) + (9 - C)=27 - (A + B + C)=27 -9=18

But in Case 2, D + E + F=9, which contradicts 18=9.

Therefore, there are no solutions in Case 2.

Hence, only Case 1 yields solutions, specifically 45.

Wait, so is the answer 45?

But hold on, let me verify.

Wait, in Case 2, S=9, T=9

But according to the above reasoning, D + E + F=18, which is inconsistent with T=9.

Therefore, in Case 2, there are no solutions.

Hence, total number of grids is 45.

But wait, hold on, let me test with the example provided.

In the example, the grid is:

0 0 8

9 9 1

So, A=0, B=0, C=8

D=9, E=9, F=1

Summing rows: 008=8, 991=991; 8 + 991=999.

Columns: 09=9, 09=9, 81=81; 9 + 9 +81=99.

So, in this case, A + B + C=0+0+8=8=S=8

D + E + F=9+9+1=19=T=19

Which is Case 1.

Indeed, in Case 2, we don't have any grids because of the contradiction.

Therefore, the total number of grids is 45.

Wait, but just to make sure, let's think about another scenario.

Suppose, in Case 2, even though D + E + F=18, which conflicts with T=9, but perhaps some of the digits can adjust?

Wait, but D=9 - A, E=9 - B, F=9 - C

So, if A + B + C=9, then D + E + F=27 -9=18, which is fixed.

So, regardless of how A, B, C are chosen, D + E + F is always 18.

But in Case 2, we need D + E + F=9, which is impossible.

Therefore, Case 2 is impossible, hence only Case 1 has 45 solutions.

Therefore, the answer is 45.

But wait, hold on, let me check again.

Wait, in Case 1, we have x=9, y=9, z=9.

Therefore, A + D=9, B + E=9, C + F=9

So, D=9 - A, E=9 - B, F=9 - C

Therefore, D + E + F=27 - (A + B + C)=27 -8=19, which is correct as per Case 1.

But in Case 2, if somehow D + E + F=9, but according to the relationship, D + E + F=27 - (A + B + C)=27 -9=18, which is inconsistent.

Thus, no solution exists for Case 2.

Hence, only 45 solutions.

Therefore, the number of ways is 45.

**Final Answer**
The number of ways is \boxed{45}.

To solve the problem of finding the number of ways to place a digit in each cell of a 2x3 grid such that the sum of the two numbers formed by the rows is 999 and the sum of the three numbers formed by the columns is 99, we need to consider the following steps:

1. **Define Variables and Equations:**
   - Let the grid be represented as:
     \[
     \begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
     \hline
     A & B & C \\
     \hline
     D & E & F \\
     \hline
     \end{array}
     \]
   - The sum of the two numbers formed by the rows is 999, which translates to:
     \[
     100A + 10B + C + 100D + 10E + F = 999
     \]
   - The sum of the three numbers formed by the columns is 99, which translates to:
     \[
     (10A + D) + (10B + E) + (10C + F) = 99
     \]
   - This can be simplified to:
     \[
     10(A + B + C) + (D + E + F) = 99
     \]

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - Let \( S = A + B + C \) and \( T = D + E + F \). We have:
     \[
     10S + T = 99
     \]
   - Solving for \( S \) and \( T \), we find:
     - \( S = 8 \) and \( T = 19 \)
     - \( S = 9 \) and \( T = 9 \)

3. **Analyze Each Case:**
   - **Case 1: \( S = 8 \) and \( T = 19 \)**
     - We need to find the number of solutions to \( A + B + C = 8 \) and \( D + E + F = 19 \).
     - From the row sum equation, we derive:
       \[
       100(A + D) + 10(B + E) + (C + F) = 999
       \]
     - This leads to \( A + D = 9 \), \( B + E = 9 \), and \( C + F = 9 \).
     - The number of non-negative integer solutions to \( A + B + C = 8 \) is given by the combination formula \( \binom{8 + 3 - 1}{3 - 1} = \binom{10}{2} = 45 \).

   - **Case 2: \( S = 9 \) and \( T = 9 \)**
     - This case leads to a contradiction because \( D + E + F \) would be 18 instead of 9, making it impossible.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Only Case 1 yields valid solutions, resulting in 45 ways.

Thus, the number of ways to place the digits is \(\boxed{45}\).
