 The problem: 
Consider the L-shaped region formed by three unit squares joined at their sides, as shown below. Two points $A$ and $B$ are chosen independently and uniformly at random from inside the region. The probability that the midpoint of $\overline{AB}$ also lies inside this L-shaped region can be expressed as $\frac{m}{n},$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n.$

Okay, so I have this problem about an L-shaped region made up of three unit squares. I need to find the probability that if I pick two points A and B randomly inside this region, their midpoint will also lie inside the region. Hmm, interesting.

First, let me try to visualize the L-shape. From the Asymptote code, it seems like it's a 3x1 rectangle attached to a 2x1 rectangle, forming an L. Wait, no, actually, looking at the coordinates, it goes from (0,0) to (2,0) to (2,1) to (1,1) to (1,2) to (0,2) and back to (0,0). So, it's like a bigger square missing a smaller square? Or maybe it's just three unit squares connected in an L shape.

Let me sketch it mentally. Starting at (0,0), moving right to (2,0), then up to (2,1), left to (1,1), up to (1,2), left to (0,2), and down to (0,0). So, yes, it's an L-shape composed of three unit squares: two along the bottom row and one on top of the first column.

So, the total area is 3 square units. Since points A and B are chosen uniformly at random, the probability we're looking for is the ratio of the area where the midpoint condition holds to the total possible area for midpoints.

Wait, no. Actually, when dealing with midpoints of two random points in a region, the set of all possible midpoints forms another region called the midpoint set or the convolution of the original region with itself scaled by 1/2. So, the probability would be the area of the intersection between this midpoint set and the original region divided by the area of the entire midpoint set?

Hmm, not sure. Maybe another approach is better.

Let me think: For each point A, the set of points B such that the midpoint M = (A + B)/2 lies within the L-shaped region. So, equivalently, B must lie within 2M - A, but since M has to lie within the region, perhaps it's better to model it differently.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to compute the probability by considering the convolution of the uniform distribution over the region with itself, then integrating over the region where the average lies within the region.

But that sounds complicated.

Wait, perhaps using geometric probability principles.

The key idea is that for two points A and B, the midpoint M lies inside the region if and only if both A and B are such that their average is in the region. So, we can model this as the Minkowski sum of the region with itself, scaled by 1/2.

Alternatively, perhaps it's helpful to note that the set of all midpoints M is the original region dilated by itself. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, more precisely, for any two points A and B in the region, their midpoint M is given by M = (A + B)/2. So, the set of all possible midpoints M is exactly the set of all averages of pairs of points in the region.

This set is sometimes called the midpoint convex hull, but in reality, for convex regions, the midpoint set is the same as the original region, but for non-convex regions, it can be larger.

In our case, the L-shaped region is not convex. So, the midpoint set might be larger than the original region.

Therefore, to compute the probability, we can think of it as:

Probability = (Area of overlap between midpoint set and original region) / (Total area of midpoint set)

But wait, no. Because both A and B are selected uniformly from the original region, so the joint distribution is uniform over the product space [region] x [region]. Then, the probability that M is inside the region is equal to the measure of all (A,B) such that M is in the region, divided by the total measure.

Since the total measure is (Area)^2, which is 9, the denominator is 9. The numerator is the area of all pairs (A,B) such that M is in the region.

But how do we compute this?

Perhaps we can parametrize points A and B as coordinates in the region.

Given the region is an L-shape, let's assign coordinates to it.

Looking at the Asymptote code, the region spans from (0,0) to (2,0) to (2,1) to (1,1) to (1,2) to (0,2) to (0,0). So, it's a union of three unit squares:

1. Square 1: (0,0) to (1,1)
2. Square 2: (1,0) to (2,1)
3. Square 3: (0,1) to (1,2)

So, it's like a vertical bar on the left (Squares 1 and 3) and a horizontal bar on the bottom (Squares 1 and 2).

To make it easier, let's represent the region in terms of coordinates:

For Square 1: x from 0 to 1, y from 0 to 1.

Square 2: x from 1 to 2, y from 0 to 1.

Square 3: x from 0 to 1, y from 1 to 2.

Hence, the entire region is defined by:

Either (0 ≤ x ≤ 1 and 0 ≤ y ≤ 2) or (1 ≤ x ≤ 2 and 0 ≤ y ≤ 1).

So, mathematically, the region R is:

R = { (x,y) | (0 ≤ x ≤ 1 and 0 ≤ y ≤ 2) or (1 ≤ x ≤ 2 and 0 ≤ y ≤ 1) }

Alright, so now, choosing points A and B uniformly from R. We need to find the probability that the midpoint M = ((Ax + Bx)/2, (Ay + By)/2) is also in R.

So, to rephrase, what is the probability that M ∈ R, given A,B ∈ R.

Now, to compute this, we can use the concept of convolution in probability. The probability density function (pdf) of M is the convolution of the pdfs of A and B, scaled appropriately. However, since both A and B are uniform over R, the pdf of M is the area where M can be expressed as (A + B)/2 with A,B in R.

But this seems abstract. Alternatively, perhaps we can model this problem geometrically.

Given that A and B are points in R, the midpoint M is in R if and only if both A and B are in some translated version of R.

Wait, let me think again. If M needs to be in R, then for M to be in R, there must exist A and B such that M = (A + B)/2.

But since A and B are themselves in R, M must lie in the set R + R scaled by 1/2.

Which is equivalent to saying that M must lie in (R + R)/2.

So, the set of all midpoints M is exactly (R + R)/2.

Thus, the probability we need is the measure of the intersection between (R + R)/2 and R, divided by the measure of R.

Wait, but the measure of R is 3, as earlier established.

But hold on, is it?

Actually, the measure (area) of R is 3, correct. But the area of (R + R)/2 is different.

Wait, in general, for sets, the Minkowski sum R + R has area related to the original set. In particular, for convex sets, the area of R + R is 4 times the area of R, but for non-convex sets, it can vary.

But in this case, R is an L-shape. Let's compute the Minkowski sum R + R.

But before that, perhaps computing (R + R)/2 is equivalent to scaling R by 1/2 and then taking the Minkowski sum with itself.

Wait, no, the Minkowski sum R + R is { a + b | a, b ∈ R }, and then dividing by 2 gives us the midpoints.

Alternatively, scaling R by 1/2 first gives us (1/2)R, and then adding (1/2)R + (1/2)R gives the same as (R + R)/2.

Yes, because scaling and adding commute in that way.

So, perhaps it's easier to compute (1/2)R + (1/2)R.

Let me define S = (1/2)R.

Then, S + S = (R + R)/2.

So, what is S?

If R is the L-shape, then scaling R by 1/2 would give us a smaller L-shape with each square scaled by 1/2.

So, S would consist of:

- A square from (0,0) to (0.5, 0.5)
- A square from (0.5, 0) to (1, 0.5)
- A square from (0, 0.5) to (0.5, 1)

So, S is an L-shape with legs of length 0.5 instead of 1.

Thus, the area of S is 3*(0.5)^2 = 3/4.

Therefore, the Minkowski sum S + S would be something else.

But computing S + S requires figuring out the set { s1 + s2 | s1, s2 ∈ S }.

Since S is an L-shape with legs of length 0.5, S + S would be a kind of expanded L-shape.

Wait, but S is contained within [0,0.5]x[0,0.5] union [0.5,1]x[0,0.5] union [0,0.5]x[0.5,1].

Adding two such S together, the maximum x-coordinate would be 1 (0.5 + 0.5), and similarly for y.

So, S + S would cover the square from (0,0) to (1,1), but with some overlaps.

Wait, let me think about specific points:

Take two points in S. Each coordinate is either in [0,0.5] or [0.5,1], depending on which part they're in.

So, adding two points from S, the resulting coordinates could range as follows:

- If both points are in the first square of S ([0,0.5]x[0,0.5]), then their sum ranges from (0,0) to (1,1).
- Similarly, adding a point from the second square ([0.5,1]x[0,0.5]) and another from the same or different parts will result in sums ranging beyond (1,1)? Wait, no, because each coordinate is only up to 0.5 + 0.5 = 1. So, actually, all sums stay within [0,1]x[0,1].

Wait, so S + S is actually the unit square [0,1]x[0,1].

Is that correct? Because even though S is a subset of the unit square, when you add two points in S, you can reach every point in the unit square.

Wait, for example, take a point (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) in S. Then, x1 + x2 can go up to 1, and similarly y1 + y2 can go up to 1. Also, for any point (a,b) in [0,1]x[0,1], can we find (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) in S such that x1 + x2 = a and y1 + y2 = b?

Yes, because for a in [0,1], split into x1 and x2 such that x1 and x2 are in [0,0.5] or [0.5,1]. For example, if a <= 1, we can choose x1 = min(a, 0.5) and x2 = a - x1, which will be in [0,0.5] or [0.5,1]. Similarly for y-coordinates. Therefore, S + S is indeed the entire unit square [0,1]x[0,1].

Therefore, (R + R)/2 = S + S = [0,1]x[0,1]. So, the set of all midpoints M is exactly the unit square.

But wait, our original region R is an L-shape with area 3, while the unit square has area 1. So, how does this affect the probability?

Hold on, actually, the set of midpoints M is the unit square. So, the probability that M is in R is equal to the area of the intersection between the unit square and R, divided by the area of the unit square.

But wait, the unit square is entirely contained within R?

No, wait. Our original region R is an L-shape covering the unit square plus an extra square on the top-left and bottom-right.

Wait, actually, looking back, R is:

Either (0 ≤ x ≤ 1 and 0 ≤ y ≤ 2) or (1 ≤ x ≤ 2 and 0 ≤ y ≤ 1). So, it's like the unit square extended upwards and to the right.

So, the unit square [0,1]x[0,1] is entirely contained within R, because for x from 0 to 1 and y from 0 to 1, it satisfies both conditions.

However, the rest of R extends beyond the unit square: above y=1 for x from 0 to 1, and to the right of x=1 for y from 0 to 1.

Therefore, the intersection of the unit square and R is just the unit square itself, which has area 1. So, the probability that M is in R is equal to 1 divided by the area of the unit square, which is 1.

Wait, that can't be right because the probability can't be 1. Because obviously, there are midpoints that lie outside R.

Wait, I think I messed up here. Let me clarify.

We have that M is in (R + R)/2, which is the unit square [0,1]x[0,1]. Now, we want the probability that M is in R. So, the probability is equal to the area of M ∩ R divided by the area of M.

But M is the unit square, so its area is 1. R is the L-shaped region with area 3.

But M ∩ R is the overlap between the unit square and R, which is the unit square itself, because R includes the unit square.

Therefore, the area of M ∩ R is 1.

So, the probability is 1 / 1 = 1? That can't be, because clearly, there are midpoints that lie outside R.

Wait, no. Hold on. Actually, the set of all midpoints M is the unit square, but we are computing the probability that a randomly selected midpoint M lies in R. Since R contains the unit square, then all midpoints M lie within R.

But that contradicts my intuition because, for example, suppose A is in the lower right square (1 ≤ x ≤ 2, 0 ≤ y ≤ 1) and B is in the upper left square (0 ≤ x ≤ 1, 1 ≤ y ≤ 2). Their midpoint M could potentially be outside the unit square, but wait, no, because the midpoint of A and B is constrained.

Wait, actually, if A is in (1,1) to (2,1) and B is in (0,1) to (1,2), then the midpoint M would be somewhere around ((1+0)/2, (1+1)/2) = (0.5, 1), which is still in R.

Wait, maybe all midpoints M do lie within R? Is that possible?

Wait, suppose A is at (2,1) and B is at (1,2). Then, M would be at ((2 + 1)/2, (1 + 2)/2) = (1.5, 1.5). Is (1.5, 1.5) in R?

Looking at R's definition: Either (0 ≤ x ≤ 1 and 0 ≤ y ≤ 2) OR (1 ≤ x ≤ 2 and 0 ≤ y ≤ 1). So, x=1.5 is between 1 and 2, but y=1.5 is greater than 1. Therefore, (1.5, 1.5) is not in R.

Ah, so the midpoint can lie outside R. Therefore, my previous conclusion was wrong.

Therefore, the set of midpoints M is the unit square, but only a part of it lies within R. Thus, the probability is the area of the unit square that overlaps with R, divided by the area of the unit square.

But wait, no, actually, the set of all midpoints M is the unit square, and the probability that M is in R is equal to the area of M intersected with R divided by the area of M.

But M is the unit square, which has area 1. So, the probability is simply Area(M ∩ R).

But we know that R includes the unit square except for the regions x > 1 and y > 1. So, M ∩ R is the unit square minus the region where x > 1 and y > 1.

So, M ∩ R = [0,1]x[0,1] minus [1,2]x[1,2], but wait, [1,2]x[1,2] is outside M, so actually, M ∩ R is just [0,1]x[0,1], since M is [0,1]x[0,1], and R includes [0,1]x[0,1].

Wait, but earlier, I saw that a midpoint like (1.5, 1.5) is not in R. But that point is not in M, since M is [0,1]x[0,1]. So, all midpoints M lie within [0,1]x[0,1], which is entirely within R.

Wait, hold on. No, the midpoint M is in [0,1]x[0,1], which is entirely within R because R includes [0,1]x[0,1].

Therefore, all midpoints M are within R. Therefore, the probability is 1.

But that contradicts the initial thought that midpoints could lie outside. Wait, perhaps my confusion arises because the midpoint is always in the unit square, which is entirely within R. Hence, regardless of where A and B are in R, the midpoint M will always be in R.

Wait, let's test with the earlier example: A=(2,1), B=(1,2). Then M=(1.5,1.5). But wait, according to the region R, to be in R, either x ≤1 and y ≤2, or x ≥1 and y ≤1.

So, (1.5,1.5): x=1.5 ≥1, y=1.5 >1. So, it doesn't satisfy either condition. Therefore, M is not in R.

But wait, according to the previous conclusion, M should be in [0,1]x[0,1], but (1.5,1.5) is not in [0,1]x[0,1]. So, my mistake was thinking that M is in [0,1]x[0,1]. But in fact, (R + R)/2 is not necessarily the entire [0,1]x[0,1]; rather, it's the set of all midpoints, which is a different set.

Wait, I need to clarify.

Earlier, I considered S = (1/2)R, then S + S = (R + R)/2. I thought S + S was the entire [0,1]x[0,1], but that may not be the case.

Wait, let's reconsider S.

S is (1/2)R, so it's an L-shape scaled down by 1/2. So, S consists of three smaller squares: each of size 0.5x0.5.

Specifically:

1. (0,0) to (0.5, 0.5)
2. (0.5, 0) to (1, 0.5)
3. (0, 0.5) to (0.5, 1)

So, S is an L-shape with legs of length 0.5.

Then, S + S is the Minkowski sum, which would include all points s1 + s2 where s1 and s2 are in S.

Each coordinate of s1 and s2 can be in [0,0.5], [0.5,1], etc.

So, for the x-coordinate, adding two points from S can give:

- If both are from [0,0.5], x1 + x2 ∈ [0,1]
- If one is from [0,0.5] and the other from [0.5,1], x1 + x2 ∈ [0.5,1.5]
- If both are from [0.5,1], x1 + x2 ∈ [1,2]

Similarly for y-coordinate.

Therefore, S + S is a square from (0,0) to (2,2), but restricted by the addition rules.

Wait, no, because each coordinate is independent. So, the x-coordinate can range from 0 to 2, and similarly for y-coordinate. But is that accurate?

Wait, no, because in S, each coordinate is confined to certain intervals. For example, the x-coordinate of S can be 0 to 0.5 or 0.5 to 1, but when you add two points from S, the x-coordinate can go beyond 1. So, S + S is actually the entire square [0,2]x[0,2], but that can't be, because S is only an L-shape.

Wait, no, that's not correct either.

Wait, let's consider specific points.

Take s1 = (0.5, 0.5) and s2 = (0.5, 0.5). Then, s1 + s2 = (1,1), which is in S + S.

Take s1 = (1, 0.5) and s2 = (1, 0.5). Then, s1 + s2 = (2,1), which is in S + S.

Similarly, s1 = (0.5, 1) and s2 = (0.5,1), then s1 + s2 = (1,2), which is in S + S.

But also, s1 = (0.5, 0) and s2 = (0.5, 0), then s1 + s2 = (1,0), which is in S + S.

What about s1 = (0,0.5) and s2 = (0.5,0)? Then, s1 + s2 = (0.5, 0.5), which is in S + S.

Wait, so it seems that S + S covers all points in [0,1]x[0,1], but also beyond?

Wait, take s1 = (0.5,0) and s2 = (1, 0.5). Then, s1 + s2 = (1.5, 0.5), which is in [0,2]x[0,2].

Similarly, s1 = (0.5,0.5) and s2 = (1,1). Wait, but (1,1) is not in S.

Wait, no, in S, the maximum x and y are 1. So, s2 cannot be (1,1). It can only be up to (1,0.5) or (0.5,1).

Wait, let's see. Take s1 = (1, 0.5) and s2 = (0.5,1). Then, s1 + s2 = (1.5, 1.5). Which is outside [0,1]x[0,1].

Therefore, S + S is actually the entire square [0,2]x[0,2], but with some restrictions.

Wait, no, that can't be because S is a subset of [0,1]x[0,1] union [0.5,1]x[0.5,1], but scaled.

Wait, this is getting confusing. Maybe I need a different approach.

Alternative approach: Instead of trying to compute the Minkowski sum, think about the set of midpoints.

Given A and B are in R, M = (A + B)/2 is in R if and only if (A + B) is in 2R.

Therefore, the set of pairs (A,B) such that A + B ∈ 2R.

So, the probability we're seeking is the volume (in 6-dimensional space) of all (A,B) such that A,B ∈ R and A + B ∈ 2R, divided by the volume of all (A,B) ∈ R x R.

But since R is a planar region, the volume is area^2, so 3^2=9.

Therefore, the numerator is the area of the set {(A,B) ∈ R x R | A + B ∈ 2R}.

But calculating this area is tricky. Perhaps it's better to switch to vector variables.

Let’s denote vectors A = (x1, y1), B = (x2, y2). Then, A + B = (x1 + x2, y1 + y2). We require that (x1 + x2, y1 + y2) ∈ 2R.

So, 2R is the dilation of R by a factor of 2, which would be an L-shape with legs of length 2 each.

Thus, 2R is:

Either (0 ≤ x ≤ 2 and 0 ≤ y ≤ 4) or (2 ≤ x ≤ 4 and 0 ≤ y ≤ 2). Wait, no, actually, scaling R by 2 in each dimension would scale the coordinates accordingly.

Wait, actually, R is an L-shape with legs of length 2 in the x-direction and 2 in the y-direction, but with some overlapping.

Wait, no, original R has:

- Along x-axis: from 0 to 2 (but split between y=0 to 1 and y=1 to 2)
- Along y-axis: from 0 to 2 (split between x=0 to 1 and x=1 to 2)

When scaled by 2, 2R would be:

- Along x-axis: from 0 to 4 (but split based on scaling)
Wait, no, scaling in geometry scales all dimensions by the same factor.

Wait, actually, if R is the original L-shape with coordinates as defined earlier, scaling R by 2 would mean expanding each coordinate by 2.

So, the scaled region 2R would have:

- Original square 1: (0,0) to (1,1) scaled by 2 becomes (0,0) to (2,2)
- Original square 2: (1,0) to (2,1) scaled by 2 becomes (2,0) to (4,2)
- Original square 3: (0,1) to (1,2) scaled by 2 becomes (0,2) to (2,4)

So, 2R is a union of three rectangles:

1. (0,0) to (2,2)
2. (2,0) to (4,2)
3. (0,2) to (2,4)

Therefore, 2R is a larger L-shape, with legs extending to 4 units in x and y directions, but with some overlapping.

Now, our condition is that (x1 + x2, y1 + y2) ∈ 2R.

So, for the pair (A,B), their sum must lie in 2R.

Given that A and B are in R, their sum can range up to 4 in x and y.

So, to compute the area of the set {(A,B) ∈ R x R | A + B ∈ 2R}, perhaps we can model this as a convolution.

But another approach is to use geometric probability.

Let me recall that for two independent uniform variables over a region R, the probability density function of their sum is the convolution of their individual densities.

But since we are dealing with uniform distributions, the probability that A + B lies within 2R is equal to the volume of the set {(A,B) | A,B ∈ R, A + B ∈ 2R} divided by the area of R squared.

Therefore, the probability P = Volume / (Area(R)^2) = Volume / 9.

So, our task reduces to finding the volume of the set S = {(A,B) | A,B ∈ R, A + B ∈ 2R}.

Calculating this volume is non-trivial, but perhaps we can exploit symmetry or perform a change of variables.

Let me consider shifting the coordinate system.

Let’s define C = A + B. Then, for each C, the number of pairs (A,B) such that A + B = C is equal to the convolution of the indicator functions of R at C.

But integrating over all C ∈ 2R, the convolution would give the desired volume.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the probability as the expected value over B of the area of R intersected with (2R - B).

That is,

P = (1/Area(R)) * Integral_{B ∈ R} [Area(R ∩ (2R - B))] dB

But since B is in R, and 2R - B is the translation of 2R by -B.

This integral represents the average area of overlap between R and 2R - B as B varies over R.

Computing this integral directly seems difficult, but maybe we can find it by breaking down the regions.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to look for known results or similar problems.

I recall that for convex sets, the probability that the midpoint lies within the set is 1, but for non-convex sets, it can vary.

But in our case, R is a union of three unit squares, which is not convex, but it's still somewhat regular.

Wait, but earlier, I saw that midpoints can lie outside R, so the probability is less than 1.

Perhaps it's better to model the problem in terms of coordinates.

Let me parameterize A and B.

Suppose A = (x1, y1) and B = (x2, y2). Both A and B are in R.

So, for A and B in R, the midpoint M = ((x1+x2)/2, (y1+y2)/2) must also be in R.

So, M must satisfy either:

1. 0 ≤ (x1 + x2)/2 ≤ 1 and 0 ≤ (y1 + y2)/2 ≤ 2, or
2. 1 ≤ (x1 + x2)/2 ≤ 2 and 0 ≤ (y1 + y2)/2 ≤ 1.

Which translates to:

1. 0 ≤ x1 + x2 ≤ 2 and 0 ≤ y1 + y2 ≤ 4, or
2. 2 ≤ x1 + x2 ≤ 4 and 0 ≤ y1 + y2 ≤ 2.

But since A and B are in R, we have constraints on x1, x2, y1, y2 individually.

So, perhaps we can write inequalities for x1, x2, y1, y2.

Given that A and B are in R:

For A:
Either (0 ≤ x1 ≤ 1 and 0 ≤ y1 ≤ 2) or (1 ≤ x1 ≤ 2 and 0 ≤ y1 ≤ 1).

Similarly for B.

Therefore, x1 and x2 are each in [0,2], but with some constraints on y1 and y2 depending on x.

This is getting complex, but maybe we can break it down.

Case 1: Both A and B are in the lower left square (0 ≤ x ≤ 1, 0 ≤ y ≤ 2).

Then, x1, x2 ∈ [0,1], y1, y2 ∈ [0,2].

Midpoint M must satisfy either:

1a. x1 + x2 ≤ 2 and y1 + y2 ≤ 4 (which is automatically true since x1 + x2 ≤ 2 and y1 + y2 ≤ 4)
and
1b. 2 ≤ x1 + x2 ≤ 4 and 0 ≤ y1 + y2 ≤ 2.

But since x1, x2 ≤ 1, x1 + x2 ≤ 2. Similarly, y1 + y2 ≤ 4.

So, for Case 1, M must satisfy either 0 ≤ x1 + x2 ≤ 2 and 0 ≤ y1 + y2 ≤ 4, but for M to be in R, we need M to be in either:

- 0 ≤ x ≤ 1 and 0 ≤ y ≤ 2, or
- 1 ≤ x ≤ 2 and 0 ≤ y ≤ 1.

Therefore, for M to be in R, given that M is the midpoint of A and B in the lower left square, we have:

Either:

1. 0 ≤ (x1 + x2)/2 ≤ 1 and 0 ≤ (y1 + y2)/2 ≤ 2, which implies 0 ≤ x1 + x2 ≤ 2 and 0 ≤ y1 + y2 ≤ 4.

Or:

2. 1 ≤ (x1 + x2)/2 ≤ 2 and 0 ≤ (y1 + y2)/2 ≤ 1, which implies 2 ≤ x1 + x2 ≤ 4 and 0 ≤ y1 + y2 ≤ 2.

But in Case 1, x1 + x2 ≤ 2, so the second condition 2 ≤ x1 + x2 ≤ 4 is impossible. Therefore, in Case 1, M is in R if and only if 0 ≤ y1 + y2 ≤ 4.

But since y1 and y2 are each ≤ 2, y1 + y2 ≤ 4 is automatically satisfied. Therefore, for Case 1, all midpoints M are in R.

Therefore, the contribution to the probability from Case 1 is the area of A and B in the lower left square, which is 1x2 for each, so 2x2=4. Since the total area is 3x3=9, the probability contribution is 4/9.

Wait, no, hold on. Actually, the probability contribution isn't 4/9, because in reality, A and B are not necessarily both in the lower left square.

Wait, perhaps it's better to consider all cases.

Case 1: Both A and B are in the lower left square (0 ≤ x ≤ 1, 0 ≤ y ≤ 2).

Case 2: A is in the lower left, B is in the lower right (1 ≤ x ≤ 2, 0 ≤ y ≤ 1).

Case 3: A is in the lower left, B is in the upper left (0 ≤ x ≤ 1, 1 ≤ y ≤ 2).

Case 4: A is in the lower right, B is in the lower left.

Case 5: A is in the lower right, B is in the lower right.

Case 6: A is in the lower right, B is in the upper right (1 ≤ x ≤ 2, 1 ≤ y ≤ 2).

Similarly for Cases 7,8,9 involving the upper left and upper right squares.

But this is getting too involved.

Maybe a better approach is to compute the probability by considering all possible positions of A and B.

Alternatively, perhaps using geometric transformations or symmetry.

Wait, another thought: since the problem is symmetric along the line y=x, perhaps we can exploit that symmetry.

Moreover, the L-shape is symmetric across the line y = x. So, without loss of generality, we can assume x1 ≤ x2 or something like that, but I don't know.

Alternatively, let's think about the expected value of the indicator variable that M is in R. So,

P = E[1_{M ∈ R}] = E[1_{(A + B)/2 ∈ R}].

But since A and B are independent and uniform over R, we can express this expectation as the double integral over R x R of 1_{(A + B)/2 ∈ R} dA dB.

Which is essentially the volume S as defined earlier.

But evaluating this integral is quite challenging.

Wait, perhaps using Fourier transforms or characteristic functions. But that might be overkill.

Alternatively, perhaps Monte Carlo methods, but since this is a math competition problem, exact computation is needed.

Another idea: Since the region R is made up of three unit squares, perhaps the convolution can be computed piecewise.

Wait, let me try to parameterize A and B.

Let’s divide R into three parts:

1. Square Q1: (0,0) to (1,1)
2. Square Q2: (0,1) to (1,2)
3. Square Q3: (1,0) to (2,1)

So, R = Q1 ∪ Q2 ∪ Q3.

Then, for A ∈ R and B ∈ R, their midpoint M can be in various regions depending on where A and B are.

But to compute whether M ∈ R, we can check whether M is in Q1, Q2, or Q3.

Therefore, we can partition the integration into cases based on which squares A and B belong to.

There are 3 choices for A and 3 choices for B, leading to 9 cases.

For each case, we can compute the region of integration where (A,B) leads to M ∈ R, and then integrate over those regions.

This seems tedious, but manageable.

Let me outline the steps:

1. For each of the 9 cases (A in Qi, B in Qj), determine the region in (A,B) space where M = (A + B)/2 is in R.

2. Integrate over these regions to get the total volume.

3. Divide by 9 to get the probability.

This is a systematic approach, although time-consuming.

So, let's proceed.

First, label the squares:

Q1: (0,0) to (1,1)
Q2: (0,1) to (1,2)
Q3: (1,0) to (2,1)

Case 1: A ∈ Q1, B ∈ Q1

Compute M = (A + B)/2.

A = (x1, y1), B = (x2, y2), with x1, x2 ∈ [0,1], y1, y2 ∈ [0,1].

So, M_x = (x1 + x2)/2, M_y = (y1 + y2)/2.

So, M ranges from (0,0) to (1,1).

Since Q1 is (0,0) to (1,1), M is always in Q1, hence in R.

Therefore, all midpoints in this case are valid.

The volume contribution is Area(Q1) * Area(Q1) = 1 * 1 = 1.

Case 2: A ∈ Q1, B ∈ Q2

A ∈ Q1: x1 ∈ [0,1], y1 ∈ [0,1]
B ∈ Q2: x2 ∈ [0,1], y2 ∈ [1,2]

Compute M = ((x1 + x2)/2, (y1 + y2)/2)

Check if M ∈ R.

R consists of Q1, Q2, Q3.

So, M must satisfy either:

1. (x1 + x2)/2 ∈ [0,1] and (y1 + y2)/2 ∈ [0,2], or
2. (x1 + x2)/2 ∈ [1,2] and (y1 + y2)/2 ∈ [0,1]

But let's compute the ranges:

(x1 + x2)/2 ∈ [0,1] since x1, x2 ∈ [0,1]

(y1 + y2)/2 ∈ [(0 + 1)/2, (1 + 2)/2] = [0.5, 1.5]

So, for M to be in R, since y-coordinate is between 0.5 and 1.5, we have to check if x1 + x2 is such that (x1 + x2)/2 is either in [0,1] and y in [0,2], which is automatically true since x1 + x2 ∈ [0,2], so (x1 + x2)/2 ∈ [0,1].

But wait, M can be in Q2 or Q1.

Wait, if M is in Q1, then M ∈ R.

If M is in Q2, then M ∈ R.

But since (x1 + x2)/2 ∈ [0,1], and (y1 + y2)/2 ∈ [0.5, 1.5], M is in Q1 or Q2.

But Q1 is y ∈ [0,1], Q2 is y ∈ [1,2]. So, (y1 + y2)/2 ∈ [0.5, 1.5]. So, when (y1 + y2)/2 < 1, M is in Q1; when >=1, M is in Q2.

But since Q1 and Q2 are both subsets of R, M is always in R.

Wait, but in this case, A is in Q1 and B is in Q2. So, let's compute M:

x ranges: (0 + 0)/2=0 to (1 + 1)/2=1
y ranges: (0 + 1)/2=0.5 to (1 + 2)/2=1.5

So, M ranges from (0, 0.5) to (1, 1.5). So, M is in Q1 if y < 1, and in Q2 if y >=1.

But since Q1 and Q2 are both in R, all midpoints are acceptable.

Therefore, all such midpoints M are in R.

Therefore, the volume contribution is Area(Q1) * Area(Q2) = 1 * 1 = 1.

Case 3: A ∈ Q1, B ∈ Q3

A ∈ Q1: x1 ∈ [0,1], y1 ∈ [0,1]
B ∈ Q3: x2 ∈ [1,2], y2 ∈ [0,1]

Compute M = ((x1 + x2)/2, (y1 + y2)/2)

Check if M ∈ R.

M_x = (x1 + x2)/2, which ranges from (0 + 1)/2=0.5 to (1 + 2)/2=1.5

M_y = (y1 + y2)/2, which ranges from (0 + 0)/2=0 to (1 + 1)/2=1

So, M_x ∈ [0.5,1.5], M_y ∈ [0,1]

Therefore, M is in either Q3 or Q2.

But Q3 is x ∈ [1,2], y ∈ [0,1], and Q2 is x ∈ [0,1], y ∈ [1,2].

Here, M has M_x ∈ [0.5,1.5] and M_y ∈ [0,1].

So, when M_x ∈ [1,1.5], M is in Q3 (since x >=1, y <=1)

When M_x ∈ [0.5,1], M is in Q2 (since x <=1, y <=1). Wait, but Q2 is y ∈ [1,2], but here M_y ∈ [0,1]. So, actually, M is in neither Q2 nor Q3.

Wait, this seems contradictory. Let me clarify.

Q3 is x ∈ [1,2], y ∈ [0,1].

Q2 is x ∈ [0,1], y ∈ [1,2].

So, if M_x ∈ [0.5,1] and M_y ∈ [0,1], then M is in Q3 if M_x ∈ [1,1.5]? Wait, no.

Wait, M_x is in [0.5,1.5], M_y is in [0,1].

So, for M_x ∈ [0.5,1], M is in Q2 if M_y ∈ [1,2], but in our case, M_y ∈ [0,1], so M is in Q3 only if M_x ∈ [1,1.5]. Otherwise, M is in neither Q2 nor Q3.

Wait, this is confusing.

Wait, in this case, M has coordinates (mx, my) where mx ∈ [0.5,1.5], my ∈ [0,1].

So, if mx ∈ [0.5,1], my ∈ [0,1]: then, is (mx, my) in R?

Looking at R's definition, for mx ∈ [0,1] and my ∈ [0,2], it's in Q1 or Q2. But mx ∈ [0.5,1] and my ∈ [0,1] would be in Q2? Wait, no. Q2 is x ∈ [0,1], y ∈ [1,2], but my is [0,1], so (mx, my) is in Q1.

But Q1 is x ∈ [0,1], y ∈ [0,1]. So, yes, (mx, my) is in Q1, hence in R.

Wait, no. When mx ∈ [0.5,1], my ∈ [0,1], then (mx, my) is in Q1 since x ∈ [0,1] and y ∈ [0,1].

Wait, but earlier, I thought M could be in Q2 or Q3, but no. Since my is <=1, it can't be in Q2. And if mx >=1, then it's in Q3.

So, correction: If mx ∈ [1,1.5], my ∈ [0,1], then (mx, my) is in Q3, which is part of R.

If mx ∈ [0.5,1], my ∈ [0,1], then (mx, my) is in Q1, which is part of R.

Therefore, all midpoints M in this case are in R.

Hence, volume contribution is 1*1=1.

Case 4: A ∈ Q2, B ∈ Q1

This is symmetric to Case 3. So, similar reasoning applies, and all midpoints M are in R.

Volume contribution: 1*1=1.

Case 5: A ∈ Q2, B ∈ Q2

A ∈ Q2: x1 ∈ [0,1], y1 ∈ [1,2]
B ∈ Q2: x2 ∈ [0,1], y2 ∈ [1,2]

Compute M = ((x1 + x2)/2, (y1 + y2)/2)

So, M_x ∈ [0,1], M_y ∈ [1,2]

Therefore, M is in Q2, which is part of R.

Therefore, all midpoints M are in R.

Volume contribution: 1*1=1.

Case 6: A ∈ Q2, B ∈ Q3

A ∈ Q2: x1 ∈ [0,1], y1 ∈ [1,2]
B ∈ Q3: x2 ∈ [1,2], y2 ∈ [0,1]

Compute M = ((x1 + x2)/2, (y1 + y2)/2)

M_x ∈ [(0 + 1)/2, (1 + 2)/2] = [0.5, 1.5]
M_y ∈ [(1 + 0)/2, (2 + 1)/2] = [0.5, 1.5]

So, M_x ∈ [0.5,1.5], M_y ∈ [0.5,1.5]

Therefore, M can be anywhere in [0.5,1.5]x[0.5,1.5]

We need to check if M is in R.

R is the union of Q1, Q2, Q3:

- Q1: x ∈ [0,1], y ∈ [0,2]
- Q2: x ∈ [0,1], y ∈ [1,2]
- Q3: x ∈ [1,2], y ∈ [0,1]

So, M is in R if:

Either:

1. M ∈ Q1: x ∈ [0,1], y ∈ [0,2], which is always true for M_x ∈ [0.5,1] and M_y ∈ [0.5,1.5]

Wait, no, M_x ∈ [0.5,1.5], M_y ∈ [0.5,1.5]

So, M is in R if:

Either:

- M_x ∈ [0,1] and M_y ∈ [0,2] (Q1)
- M_x ∈ [0,1] and M_y ∈ [1,2] (Q2)
- M_x ∈ [1,2] and M_y ∈ [0,1] (Q3)

But M_x ∈ [0.5,1.5], M_y ∈ [0.5,1.5]

Therefore, M is in R if:

- If M_x ∈ [0,1] and M_y ∈ [0,2] → yes, since M_x ∈ [0.5,1] ⊂ [0,1], M_y ∈ [0.5,1.5] ⊂ [0,2]
- If M_x ∈ [0.5,1], M_y ∈ [1,1.5] → M is in Q2, since M_x ∈ [0,1], M_y ∈ [1,2]
- If M_x ∈ [1,1.5], M_y ∈ [0.5,1] → M is in Q3, since M_x ∈ [1,2], M_y ∈ [0,1]
- If M_x ∈ [1,1.5], M_y ∈ [1,1.5] → M is not in R, since M_x ∈ [1,2], M_y ∈ [1,2], which is outside Q3.

Therefore, the region where M is not in R is when M_x ∈ [1,1.5] and M_y ∈ [1,1.5].

So, the forbidden region is the square [1,1.5]x[1,1.5].

Therefore, the volume contribution for this case is the area where M is in R.

But since A and B are independent and uniform over their respective squares, we need to compute the volume over A and B where M is in R.

This is equivalent to integrating over A ∈ Q2, B ∈ Q3, and M = (A + B)/2 ∈ R.

But instead of doing it in Cartesian coordinates, perhaps it's easier to compute the area where M is not in R and subtract from the total.

The total area for this case is 1*1=1.

The forbidden area is the area where M ∈ [1,1.5]x[1,1.5].

So, M_x = (x1 + x2)/2 ∈ [1,1.5] ⇒ x1 + x2 ∈ [2,3]

Similarly, M_y = (y1 + y2)/2 ∈ [1,1.5] ⇒ y1 + y2 ∈ [2,3]

Therefore, the forbidden region is the set of (x1, x2, y1, y2) such that x1 + x2 ∈ [2,3] and y1 + y2 ∈ [2,3], with x1 ∈ [0,1], x2 ∈ [1,2], y1 ∈ [1,2], y2 ∈ [0,1].

So, to compute the volume where M is not in R, we can compute the area where x1 + x2 ∈ [2,3] and y1 + y2 ∈ [2,3].

But x1 ∈ [0,1], x2 ∈ [1,2], so x1 + x2 ∈ [1,3].

Similarly, y1 ∈ [1,2], y2 ∈ [0,1], so y1 + y2 ∈ [1,3].

So, the forbidden region is the set where x1 + x2 ∈ [2,3] and y1 + y2 ∈ [2,3].

But since x1 and x2 are independent, as are y1 and y2, the forbidden volume is (Area where x1 + x2 ∈ [2,3]) * (Area where y1 + y2 ∈ [2,3]).

Because x and y are independent.

Therefore, compute:

Area_x = Probability that x1 + x2 ∈ [2,3], where x1 ~ U[0,1], x2 ~ U[1,2]

Similarly, Area_y = Probability that y1 + y2 ∈ [2,3], where y1 ~ U[1,2], y2 ~ U[0,1]

Compute Area_x:

x1 ∈ [0,1], x2 ∈ [1,2], x1 + x2 ∈ [2,3]

So, x1 + x2 >=2 ⇒ x1 >= 2 - x2

But x2 ∈ [1,2], so 2 - x2 ∈ [0,1].

Therefore, for each x2 ∈ [1,2], x1 >= 2 - x2.

Similarly, x1 <= 1, and x2 <=2.

Therefore, the region is a polygon.

Let me plot x1 vs x2.

For x2 ∈ [1,2]:

x1 >= 2 - x2

x1 <=1

So, for each x2, x1 ranges from max(0, 2 - x2) to 1.

But since x2 >=1, 2 - x2 <=1.

So, x1 ranges from 2 - x2 to 1.

Therefore, the area is the integral from x2=1 to x2=2 of (1 - (2 - x2)) dx2 = integral from 1 to 2 of (x2 -1) dx2.

Compute:

Integral (x2 -1) dx2 from 1 to 2 = [0.5 x2^2 - x2] from 1 to 2

At 2: 0.5*(4) - 2 = 2 - 2 = 0

At 1: 0.5*(1) -1 = 0.5 -1 = -0.5

So, the integral is 0 - (-0.5) = 0.5

Therefore, Area_x = 0.5

Similarly, compute Area_y:

y1 ∈ [1,2], y2 ∈ [0,1], y1 + y2 ∈ [2,3]

Similarly, y1 + y2 >=2 ⇒ y1 >= 2 - y2

y2 ∈ [0,1], so 2 - y2 ∈ [1,2]

Also, y1 <=2, y2 <=1.

Therefore, for each y2 ∈ [0,1], y1 >= 2 - y2.

But y1 ∈ [1,2], so y1 >= max(1, 2 - y2)

But since y2 ∈ [0,1], 2 - y2 ∈ [1,2]

So, y1 >= 2 - y2

Therefore, for each y2, y1 ranges from 2 - y2 to 2.

Therefore, the area is the integral from y2=0 to y2=1 of (2 - (2 - y2)) dy2 = integral from 0 to1 of y2 dy2 = [0.5 y2^2] from 0 to1 = 0.5

Therefore, Area_y = 0.5

Therefore, forbidden volume = Area_x * Area_y = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25

Hence, the allowed volume in this case is 1 - 0.25 = 0.75

Therefore, the volume contribution is 0.75

Case 7: A ∈ Q2, B ∈ Q3: volume contribution is 0.75

Case 8: A ∈ Q3, B ∈ Q1: symmetric to Case 7, so volume contribution is 0.75

Case 9: A ∈ Q3, B ∈ Q3: symmetric to Case 5, so volume contribution is 1*1=1.

Now, adding up all the contributions:

Case 1: 1

Case 2:1

Case3:1

Case4:1

Case5:1

Case6:0.75

Case7:0.75

Case8:0.75

Case9:1

Total volume contribution: 1+1+1+1+1+0.75+0.75+0.75+1 =

Let me compute:

Number of Case1-5: 5 cases, each contributing 1: 5

Cases6-8: 3 cases, each contributing 0.75: 3*0.75=2.25

Case9:1

Total: 5 + 2.25 +1 = 8.25

Therefore, the total volume where M ∈ R is 8.25

Since the total area is 3, the probability is 8.25 / 9 = 0.916666...

Convert to fraction: 8.25 = 33/4, so 33/4 divided by 9 is 33/(4*9)=11/12≈0.916666...

Wait, 33/4 divided by 9 is (33/4)*(1/9)=11/12.

Yes, 11/12.

Therefore, the probability is 11/12.

Wait, but let me verify the calculations.

Total volume contributions:

Case1:1

Case2:1

Case3:1

Case4:1

Case5:1

Case6:0.75

Case7:0.75

Case8:0.75

Case9:1

Total:1+1+1+1+1+0.75+0.75+0.75+1= 1*5 + 0.75*3 +1=5 + 2.25 +1=8.25

Yes, 8.25.

Total area is 9, so probability is 8.25 /9 = 11/12.

Therefore, m=11, n=12, which are coprime.

Thus, m + n =23.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{23}
</think>

The problem involves finding the probability that the midpoint of a segment connecting two randomly chosen points \(A\) and \(B\) inside an L-shaped region also lies within the region. The L-shaped region is composed of three unit squares and has an area of 3.

To solve this, we consider the convolution of the region with itself, which is the set of all possible midpoints \(M = \left(\frac{A_x + B_x}{2}, \frac{A_y + B_y}{2}\right)\). The key steps involve analyzing the contributions of different cases where \(A\) and \(B\) lie in various parts of the region.

After detailed analysis of each case, we find that the total volume of the set of midpoints that lie within the L-shaped region is calculated as follows:

1. **Case Analysis**: We break down the problem into 9 cases based on the positions of \(A\) and \(B\) within the region.
2. **Volume Contributions**: Each case contributes a specific volume to the total volume where the midpoint lies within the region.
3. **Summing Contributions**: Summing the contributions from all cases, we find the total volume to be 8.25.
4. **Probability Calculation**: Dividing this total volume by the area of the region squared (which is 9), we get the probability as \(\frac{11}{12}\).

Thus, the probability is \(\frac{11}{12}\), and the sum of the numerator and denominator is \(11 + 12 = 23\).

\[
\boxed{23}
