 The problem: 
Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice's play.


Alright, so I'm trying to figure out this problem where Alice and Bob are playing a game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens, and the person who takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n ≤ 2024 mean that Bob can guarantee a win no matter what Alice does.

Hmm, okay, let's break this down. It sounds like a combinatorial game theory problem. Maybe something related to winning and losing positions. I remember that in such games, certain positions are "winning" if the current player can force a win, and "losing" if the current player cannot avoid losing if the opponent plays optimally.

So, if we define a position as a number of tokens left, then each position is either a winning (W) or losing (L) position for the player whose turn it is.

Since Alice goes first, Bob can only guarantee a win if the starting position (n tokens) is a losing position for Alice. So, essentially, we need to count the number of losing positions for Alice when n ≤ 2024.

Let me try to find a pattern or a recurrence relation for these positions.

First, let's consider small values of n and see who would win:

- n = 1: Alice takes 1 token and wins. So, W for Alice.
- n = 2: Alice can take 1 token, leaving 1 for Bob, who then takes it and wins. Wait, but hold on—if Alice takes 1, Bob takes the remaining 1 and wins. Alternatively, could Alice take 4 tokens? No, since there are only 2. So, Bob wins here. So, L for Alice.
Wait, actually, wait, if n=2, Alice can only take 1, leaving 1 for Bob, who then takes it and wins. So, n=2 is a losing position for Alice, meaning Bob can win. So, L.

Similarly, n=3: Alice can take 1, leaving 2 for Bob. From above, n=2 is a losing position for Bob, right? Because if Bob is faced with n=2, he can't take 4, so he takes 1, leaving 1 for Alice, who then takes it and wins. Wait, now I'm confused.

Wait, maybe I should tabulate this properly.

Let's make a table for n from 0 upwards, labeling each as W or L.

n=0: Well, if there are 0 tokens, the game is over, so it's a losing position because the player cannot move. But in our case, the game ends when someone takes the last token, so n=0 isn't really part of the game. Hmm, maybe we should start at n=1.

But sometimes in these problems, n=0 is considered a losing position because you can't make a move. Let me think about that.

If we model this correctly, the base case is n=0: it's a losing position because you can't take any tokens, so the previous player has won. Therefore, for n ≥ 1, if a player can move to n=0, they win. So, n=1 is a winning position because you can take 1 token and win. Similarly, n=4 is also a winning position because you can take all 4 tokens and win.

Wait, but in our original problem, you can take 1 or 4 tokens. So, for n=1, taking 1 token wins. For n=2, taking 1 token leaves 1, which is a winning position for the opponent. Taking 4 tokens isn't possible. So, n=2 is a losing position because whatever you do, the opponent can win.

Similarly, n=3: If you take 1, you leave 2 for the opponent, who is in a losing position. So, n=3 is a winning position.

n=4: You can take all 4 and win. So, n=4 is a winning position.

n=5: If you take 1, you leave 4, which is a winning position for the opponent. If you take 4, you leave 1, which is a winning position for the opponent. So, n=5 is a losing position.

n=6: If you take 1, you leave 5, which is a losing position for the opponent. So, n=6 is a winning position.

n=7: Take 1, leave 6 (winning for opponent). Take 4, leave 3 (which was a winning position for the opponent, as n=3). So, both options leave opponent in a winning position. Hence, n=7 is a losing position.

Wait, hold on, n=3 is a winning position for the player who faces it, right? Because the player can take 1 and leave n=2, which is losing for the opponent.

Wait, perhaps my confusion arises from whether the position is labeled as W or L for the current player.

Maybe I should clarify:

- If from a position, the current player can force a win, it's a W position.
- If every move leads to a W position for the opponent, then it's an L position.

So, let's redo this:

n=0: Losing (base case)
n=1: Can take 1 to reach 0, so W
n=2: Can only take 1 to reach 1, which is W for opponent, so L
n=3: Can take 1 to reach 2 (L), so W
n=4: Can take 4 to reach 0, so W
n=5: Can take 1 to reach 4 (W) or take 4 to reach 1 (W). Both lead to W, so L
n=6: Can take 1 to reach 5 (L), so W
n=7: Can take 1 to reach 6 (W) or take 4 to reach 3 (W). Both lead to W, so L
n=8: Take 1 to reach 7 (L), so W
n=9: Take 1 to reach 8 (W) or take 4 to reach 5 (L). So, since taking 4 leads to L, the current player can choose to go to L, so n=9 is W
n=10: Take 1 to reach 9 (W) or take 4 to reach 6 (W). Both lead to W, so L
n=11: Take 1 to reach 10 (L), so W
n=12: Take 1 to reach 11 (W) or take 4 to reach 8 (W). Both lead to W, so L
n=13: Take 1 to reach 12 (L), so W
n=14: Take 1 to reach 13 (W) or take 4 to reach 10 (L). So, since taking 4 leads to L, n=14 is W
n=15: Take 1 to reach 14 (W) or take 4 to reach 11 (W). Both lead to W, so L
n=16: Take 1 to reach 15 (L), so W
n=17: Take 1 to reach 16 (W) or take 4 to reach 13 (W). Both lead to W, so L
n=18: Take 1 to reach 17 (L), so W
n=19: Take 1 to reach 18 (W) or take 4 to reach 15 (L). So, taking 4 leads to L, so n=19 is W
n=20: Take 1 to reach 19 (W) or take 4 to reach 16 (W). Both lead to W, so L

Okay, so compiling this list, the losing positions (L) are at n=0, 2, 5, 7, 10, 12, 15, 17, 20,...

Looking at the differences between these:

From 0 to 2: +2

2 to 5: +3

5 to 7: +2

7 to 10: +3

10 to 12: +2

12 to 15: +3

15 to 17: +2

17 to 20: +3

Hmm, so the pattern seems to be adding 2, then 3, repeating.

So, the losing positions are numbers congruent to 2 mod 5 and 0 mod 5?

Wait, let's check:

n=2: 2 mod 5 is 2

n=5: 5 mod 5 is 0

n=7: 7 mod 5 is 2

n=10: 10 mod 5 is 0

n=12: 12 mod 5 is 2

n=15: 15 mod 5 is 0

n=17: 17 mod 5 is 2

n=20: 20 mod 5 is 0

Yes, exactly. So, the losing positions are numbers where n ≡ 0 mod 5 or n ≡ 2 mod 5.

So, n ≡ 0 or 2 mod 5.

Therefore, for Bob to have a winning strategy, n must be congruent to 0 or 2 modulo 5.

Wait, but let me verify this with the earlier analysis.

At n=0: L

n=2: L

n=5: L

n=7: L

n=10: L

n=12: L

n=15: L

n=17: L

n=20: L

Yep, that's consistent.

So, if n ≡ 0 or 2 mod 5, then it's a losing position for the player whose turn it is.

In our problem, Alice starts first. So, if n is a losing position, Alice cannot win, meaning Bob can win.

Hence, the number of such n ≤ 2024 is the number of integers n where n ≡ 0 or 2 mod 5.

Now, let's compute how many numbers ≤2024 satisfy n ≡0 mod5 or n≡2 mod5.

Total numbers ≡0 mod5: floor(2024/5)=404 (since 5×404=2020)

Numbers ≡2 mod5: The first such number is 2, then 7, 12,... up to the largest ≤2024.

The sequence is 2,7,12,..., let's find the last term.

We can write it as 5k+2 ≤2024 => 5k ≤2022 => k ≤2022/5=404.4, so k=404, giving 5*404+2=2022.

Thus, the number of terms ≡2 mod5 is 405 (from k=0 to k=404).

Wait, hold on: When k=0, it's 2; k=1, 7; ... k=404, 2022. So, that's 405 numbers.

Similarly, numbers ≡0 mod5: from 5,10,...,2020, which is 404 numbers (since 5*404=2020).

Wait, but 0 mod5 includes n=0, but in our problem n starts at 1, so n=5,10,...,2020: 404 numbers.

But n=0 is not counted, so total numbers n≤2024 where n≡0 or 2 mod5 is 404 + 405=809.

Wait, but hold on, let's double-check:

Numbers ≡0 mod5: multiples of 5 from 5 to 2020.

Number of terms: (2020 -5)/5 +1= (2015)/5 +1=403 +1=404. Correct.

Numbers ≡2 mod5: starting from 2, next 7,..., last term is 2022.

Number of terms: ((2022 -2)/5)+1= (2020)/5 +1=404 +1=405. Correct.

Thus, total losing positions: 404 +405=809.

Therefore, the number of n ≤2024 where Bob can guarantee a win is 809.

Wait, but let me make sure that the initial assumption holds. Because sometimes in these modular arithmetic problems, especially with different move sizes, the periodicity might not hold beyond the initial terms. But in this case, since the moves are 1 and 4, which are coprime, the period should be 5, right?

Because 1 and 4 generate steps that cover all residues modulo 5 eventually.

Wait, but in our analysis, we saw that the losing positions are every 5 numbers starting at 0 and 2. So, 0,2,5,7,10,12,... which indeed are periodic with period 5.

Hence, the pattern repeats every 5 numbers, with two losing positions per period.

So, in each block of 5 numbers, there are 2 losing positions. Therefore, the density is 2/5.

Thus, for n up to 2024, approximately (2/5)*2024≈809.6, which aligns with our exact calculation of 809.

So, yeah, I think 809 is the correct answer.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{809}
</think>

To determine the number of positive integers \( n \) less than or equal to 2024 for which Bob can guarantee a win, we analyze the game using combinatorial game theory. We define winning (W) and losing (L) positions for the player whose turn it is.

Key steps:
1. Identify the losing positions for Alice, which means Bob can win.
2. Losing positions occur when \( n \equiv 0 \pmod{5} \) or \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \).
3. Count the numbers \( n \leq 2024 \) that satisfy these conditions.

Detailed steps:
1. Losing positions are found to be \( n \equiv 0 \pmod{5} \) or \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \).
2. Calculate the number of terms for each residue class:
   - Numbers \( \equiv 0 \pmod{5} \): These are 5, 10, ..., 2020. There are \( \frac{2020}{5} = 404 \) terms.
   - Numbers \( \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \): These are 2, 7, ..., 2022. There are \( \frac{2022 - 2}{5} + 1 = 405 \) terms.
3. Sum the counts: \( 404 + 405 = 809 \).

Thus, the number of positive integers \( n \leq 2024 \) for which Bob can guarantee a win is \(\boxed{809}\).
