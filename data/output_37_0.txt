 The problem: 
Positive real numbers $b \not= 1$ and $n$ satisfy the equations \[\sqrt{\log_b n} = \log_b \sqrt{n} \qquad \text{and} \qquad b \cdot \log_b n = \log_b (bn).\] The value of $n$ is $\frac{j}{k},$ where $j$ and $k$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $j+k.$


Okay, so I have this problem here with logarithms and some equations to solve for positive real numbers \( b \) and \( n \), where \( b \neq 1 \). The goal is to find \( n \) expressed as a fraction \( \frac{j}{k} \) in simplest terms and then compute \( j + k \).

Let me first write down the given equations:

1. \( \sqrt{\log_b n} = \log_b \sqrt{n} \)
2. \( b \cdot \log_b n = \log_b (bn) \)

Hmm, both equations involve logarithms with base \( b \) of expressions involving \( n \). Maybe if I can express both sides of each equation in terms of \( \log_b n \), that might help.

Starting with the first equation: \( \sqrt{\log_b n} = \log_b \sqrt{n} \).

I know that \( \log_b \sqrt{n} \) can be rewritten using logarithm properties. Specifically, \( \log_b n^{1/2} = \frac{1}{2} \log_b n \). So, substituting that into the equation gives:

\( \sqrt{\log_b n} = \frac{1}{2} \log_b n \)

Let me let \( x = \log_b n \) to simplify things. Then the equation becomes:

\( \sqrt{x} = \frac{1}{2} x \)

That looks more manageable. Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root:

\( (\sqrt{x})^2 = \left( \frac{1}{2} x \right)^2 \)

Which simplifies to:

\( x = \frac{1}{4} x^2 \)

Bring all terms to one side:

\( \frac{1}{4} x^2 - x = 0 \)

Factor out an \( x \):

\( x \left( \frac{1}{4} x - 1 \right) = 0 \)

So, either \( x = 0 \) or \( \frac{1}{4}x - 1 = 0 \).

If \( x = 0 \), then \( \log_b n = 0 \). Since \( b \) is a positive real number not equal to 1, this would imply \( n = b^0 = 1 \). But let's check if this works in the original equation.

Plugging back into the first equation: \( \sqrt{\log_b 1} = \log_b \sqrt{1} \). Both sides become \( \sqrt{0} = 0 \) and \( \log_b 1 = 0 \), so it's valid. However, we should also check if \( n = 1 \) satisfies the second equation.

Second equation: \( b \cdot \log_b n = \log_b (bn) \). If \( n = 1 \), then LHS is \( b \cdot 0 = 0 \), and RHS is \( \log_b (b \cdot 1) = \log_b b = 1 \). So, 0 â‰  1, which is a contradiction. Therefore, \( x = 0 \) isn't a valid solution.

Thus, the other case is \( \frac{1}{4}x - 1 = 0 \), so \( \frac{1}{4}x = 1 \), meaning \( x = 4 \). Therefore, \( \log_b n = 4 \), so \( n = b^4 \).

Alright, so from the first equation, we've got \( n = b^4 \). Now let's use the second equation to find \( b \).

The second equation: \( b \cdot \log_b n = \log_b (bn) \)

Again, since \( n = b^4 \), substitute that in:

Left-hand side (LHS): \( b \cdot \log_b (b^4) \)

Right-hand side (RHS): \( \log_b (b \cdot b^4) = \log_b (b^5) \)

Compute LHS: \( \log_b (b^4) = 4 \), so LHS is \( b \cdot 4 = 4b \)

Compute RHS: \( \log_b (b^5) = 5 \)

Therefore, the equation becomes:

\( 4b = 5 \)

Solving for \( b \), divide both sides by 4:

\( b = \frac{5}{4} \)

Now, since we have \( n = b^4 \), plug in \( b = \frac{5}{4} \):

\( n = \left( \frac{5}{4} \right)^4 = \frac{625}{256} \)

Check if this reduces: 625 and 256 share no common factors besides 1 because 625 is \( 5^4 \) and 256 is \( 2^8 \). So, they are co-prime.

Hence, \( n = \frac{625}{256} \), so \( j = 625 \) and \( k = 256 \). Therefore, \( j + k = 625 + 256 \).

Calculating that sum: 625 + 256

625 + 200 = 825

825 + 56 = 881

So, \( j + k = 881 \).

Wait, just double-checking my steps to make sure I didn't skip anything or make a mistake.

First equation: converted correctly, set \( x = \log_b n \), solved quadratic, got \( x = 4 \), so \( n = b^4 \). Then substituted into second equation, simplified, found \( b = 5/4 \), then calculated \( n = (5/4)^4 = 625/256 \). Yes, seems solid.

And checking whether \( n = 625/256 \) satisfies both equations.

First equation: sqrt(log_b n) vs log_b sqrt(n). With \( n = 625/256 \), \( log_b n = 4 \), so sqrt(4) = 2. On the other side, log_b sqrt(n) = log_b (n^{1/2}) = (1/2) log_b n = 2. So yes, 2 = 2.

Second equation: b * log_b n = log_b (b n). We have \( log_b n = 4 \), so LHS is 5/4 * 4 = 5. RHS: log_b (b * n) = log_b (b * (b^4)) = log_b (b^5) = 5. So, 5 = 5. Perfect.

So, everything checks out.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{881}
</think>

Given the equations involving logarithms with base \( b \):

1. \(\sqrt{\log_b n} = \log_b \sqrt{n}\)
2. \(b \cdot \log_b n = \log_b (bn)\)

We start by rewriting the first equation using logarithm properties. Let \( x = \log_b n \). Then the equation becomes:

\[
\sqrt{x} = \frac{1}{2} x
\]

Squaring both sides, we get:

\[
x = \frac{1}{4} x^2
\]

Factoring out \( x \):

\[
x \left( \frac{1}{4} x - 1 \right) = 0
\]

This gives \( x = 0 \) or \( x = 4 \). Since \( x = 0 \) leads to a contradiction in the second equation, we have \( x = 4 \). Thus, \( \log_b n = 4 \) implies \( n = b^4 \).

Next, we substitute \( n = b^4 \) into the second equation:

\[
b \cdot \log_b (b^4) = \log_b (b \cdot b^4)
\]

Simplifying both sides, we get:

\[
b \cdot 4 = 5
\]

Solving for \( b \):

\[
4b = 5 \implies b = \frac{5}{4}
\]

Substituting \( b = \frac{5}{4} \) back into \( n = b^4 \):

\[
n = \left( \frac{5}{4} \right)^4 = \frac{625}{256}
\]

Since 625 and 256 are coprime, \( n = \frac{625}{256} \). Therefore, \( j = 625 \) and \( k = 256 \), giving us \( j + k = 625 + 256 = 881 \).

\[
\boxed{881}
\]
