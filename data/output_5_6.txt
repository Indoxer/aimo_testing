 The problem: 
Given $\triangle ABC$ and a point $P$ on one of its sides, call line $\ell$ the $\textit{splitting line}$ of $\triangle ABC$ through $P$ if $\ell$ passes through $P$ and divides $\triangle ABC$ into two polygons of equal perimeter. Let $\triangle ABC$ be a triangle where $BC = 219$ and $AB$ and $AC$ are positive integers. Let $M$ and $N$ be the midpoints of $\overline{AB}$ and $\overline{AC},$ respectively, and suppose that the splitting lines of $\triangle ABC$ through $M$ and $N$ intersect at $30^\circ.$ Find the perimeter of $\triangle ABC.$


To solve the problem, we start by understanding the properties of the splitting lines through the midpoints \( M \) and \( N \) of sides \( AB \) and \( AC \), respectively. These lines divide \( \triangle ABC \) into two polygons of equal perimeter.

First, let's denote the side lengths of \( \triangle ABC \) as follows:
- \( BC = a = 219 \)
- \( AB = c \)
- \( AC = b \)

Since \( M \) and \( N \) are midpoints, we have:
- \( AM = \frac{c}{2} \)
- \( AN = \frac{b}{2} \)

The splitting line through \( M \) divides \( \triangle ABC \) into two polygons with equal perimeters. Similarly, the splitting line through \( N \) also divides \( \triangle ABC \) into two polygons with equal perimeters.

Given that these splitting lines intersect at \( 30^\circ \), we need to find the relationship between the sides \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \).

### Step 1: Use the Angle Bisector Theorem
The angle bisector theorem states that the angle bisector of an angle in a triangle divides the opposite side into segments proportional to the adjacent sides. However, since \( M \) and \( N \) are midpoints, the splitting lines through them are not necessarily angle bisectors but still divide the triangle into equal perimeters.

### Step 2: Consider the Perimeter Condition
For the splitting lines through \( M \) and \( N \) to divide \( \triangle ABC \) into two polygons of equal perimeter, the total perimeter of \( \triangle ABC \) must be even. Let the perimeter be \( P \):
\[ P = a + b + c = 219 + b + c \]

Since \( P \) is even, \( b + c \) must be odd (because 219 is odd).

### Step 3: Use the Geometry of the Intersection
The intersection of the splitting lines at \( 30^\circ \) implies a specific geometric configuration. We can use trigonometric properties to relate the sides and angles. However, a more straightforward approach is to consider the properties of the medians and the fact that the intersection forms a special angle.

### Step 4: Use the Median Length Formula
The length of the median from vertex \( A \) to the midpoint \( M \) of \( BC \) is given by:
\[ m_a = \sqrt{\frac{2b^2 + 2c^2 - a^2}{4}} \]
Similarly, the length of the median from vertex \( B \) to the midpoint \( N \) of \( AC \) is:
\[ m_b = \sqrt{\frac{2a^2 + 2c^2 - b^2}{4}} \]

### Step 5: Use the Area Condition
The area of \( \triangle ABC \) can be expressed using Heron's formula or by considering the height from \( A \) to \( BC \). However, we need to find a simpler relationship involving the angles.

### Step 6: Solve for \( b \) and \( c \)
Given the symmetry and the angle condition, we can use the fact that the angle between the medians is \( 30^\circ \). This implies a specific relationship between the sides. By symmetry and the properties of the triangle, we can deduce that:
\[ b = c \]

### Step 7: Verify the Solution
If \( b = c \), then:
\[ P = 219 + b + b = 219 + 2b \]

Since \( b \) must be an integer, we need to find \( b \) such that \( P \) is even. Given the symmetry and the properties of the triangle, we find:
\[ b = 109.5 \]

However, this is not possible since \( b \) must be an integer. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate our approach.
