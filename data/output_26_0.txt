 The problem: 
Let $x_1\leq x_2\leq \cdots\leq x_{100}$ be real numbers such that $|x_1| + |x_2| + \cdots + |x_{100}| = 1$ and $x_1 + x_2 + \cdots + x_{100} = 0$. Among all such $100$-tuples of numbers, the greatest value that $x_{76} - x_{16}$ can achieve is $\tfrac mn$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.


Alright, so I have this problem where I need to find the maximum value of \( x_{76} - x_{16} \) given some conditions on the sequence of real numbers. Let me try to unpack this step by step.

First, let's restate the problem in my own words to make sure I understand it. We have 100 real numbers arranged in non-decreasing order, meaning each number is less than or equal to the next one. So, \( x_1 \leq x_2 \leq \dots \leq x_{100} \). 

There are two main conditions:
1. The sum of their absolute values is 1: \( |x_1| + |x_2| + \dots + |x_{100}| = 1 \).
2. Their regular sum is zero: \( x_1 + x_2 + \dots + x_{100} = 0 \).

We need to find the maximum possible value of \( x_{76} - x_{16} \) among all such sequences, and express this maximum as a reduced fraction \( \frac{m}{n} \), then find \( m + n \).

Hmm, okay. So, the goal is to maximize the difference between the 76th term and the 16th term in this ordered list. Since the sequence is non-decreasing, \( x_{76} \geq x_{16} \), so their difference is non-negative. Therefore, we're looking for how large this difference can be under the given constraints.

I think the key here is to figure out how to arrange the numbers such that \( x_{76} \) is as large as possible while \( x_{16} \) is as small as possible, without violating the sum conditions.

But before diving into that, let me consider the constraints more carefully.

Given that the sum of the absolute values is 1, which means the total "magnitude" of all the numbers is 1. However, their regular sum is zero, which implies that the positives and negatives must balance each other out.

So, perhaps half of them are positive and half are negative? But wait, not necessarily exactly half because there could be more negatives or positives depending on the specific arrangement.

Wait, but since they are ordered, if we have more negative numbers towards the left (smaller indices) and more positive towards the right, that would help in balancing the sums.

But actually, the sum of absolute values being 1 and the regular sum being zero suggests that the total positive part equals the total negative part. Because when you take absolute values, both positives and negatives become positive, and their sum is 1. But when you take the regular sum, the positives and negatives cancel each other out.

Therefore, if \( S^+ \) is the sum of positive terms and \( S^- \) is the sum of negative terms, we have:

\( S^+ + |S^-| = 1 \) because \( |x_i| \) adds up to 1.

And,

\( S^+ + S^- = 0 \) because the total sum is zero.

From these two equations, subtracting the second from the first gives:

\( (S^+ + |S^-|) - (S^+ + S^-) = 1 - 0 \)
\( |S^-| - S^- = 1 \)

Since \( S^- \) is negative (because it's the sum of negative terms), let me denote \( |S^-| = -S^- \). Then,

\( (-S^-) - S^- = 1 \)
\( -2S^- = 1 \)
\( S^- = -\frac{1}{2} \)

Therefore, \( S^+ = \frac{1}{2} \).

So, the sum of all positive terms is \( \frac{1}{2} \), and the sum of all negative terms is \( -\frac{1}{2} \). That makes sense—they balance each other out to give a total sum of zero, and their absolute values add up to 1.

Okay, so now I know that the total positive contribution is \( \frac{1}{2} \) and the total negative contribution is \( -\frac{1}{2} \).

Now, going back to our original goal: maximizing \( x_{76} - x_{16} \). Since the sequence is non-decreasing, \( x_{16} \leq x_{76} \). To maximize their difference, we want \( x_{76} \) to be as large as possible and \( x_{16} \) as small as possible.

But we also have to consider how many terms we have on either side of these positions. Specifically, \( x_{16} \) is at position 16, and \( x_{76} \) is at position 76. There are 15 terms before \( x_{16} \) and 24 terms after \( x_{76} \) (since 100 - 76 = 24).

So, maybe if we set as many of the first 16 terms as negative as possible (to minimize \( x_{16} \)), and as many of the last 25 terms (from 76 to 100) as positive as possible (to maximize \( x_{76} \)).

But wait, we have to ensure that the sum of the entire sequence is zero and the sum of absolute values is 1.

Perhaps an optimal strategy is to set the first k terms as negative as possible, and the last (100 - k) terms as positive as possible, with the middle terms possibly zero or something else. But given that we need to maximize \( x_{76} - x_{16} \), perhaps it's best to set all terms before \( x_{16} \) to be as negative as possible, and all terms from \( x_{76} \) onwards as positive as possible, with the rest being zero.

Wait, but let me think about that.

Suppose we have:

- The first 16 terms as negative numbers,
- The terms from 17 to 75 as zeros,
- The terms from 76 to 100 as positive numbers.

This way, \( x_{16} \) is the last negative term, and \( x_{76} \) is the first positive term. Then, the difference \( x_{76} - x_{16} \) would be maximized because \( x_{16} \) is minimized and \( x_{76} \) is maximized.

But let me check if this setup satisfies the constraints.

First, the sum of absolute values would be twice the sum of the magnitudes of the negative terms plus the sum of the positive terms. Wait, no—actually, in this case, if the first 16 terms are negative, say each is equal to some value \( a \), and the last 25 terms (from 76 to 100) are positive, each equal to \( b \), then:

Sum of absolute values: \( 16|a| + 25b = 1 \).

Sum of the sequence: \( 16a + 25b = 0 \).

Because the middle terms (17 to 75) are zeros, they don't contribute to either sum.

So, now, we have two equations:

1. \( 16a + 25b = 0 \)
2. \( 16|a| + 25b = 1 \)

But note that \( a \) is negative because we're setting the first 16 terms as negative, so \( |a| = -a \).

Thus, equation 2 becomes:

\( 16(-a) + 25b = 1 \)
\( -16a + 25b = 1 \)

Equation 1 is:

\( 16a + 25b = 0 \)

Now, we can solve these two equations simultaneously.

From equation 1: \( 16a + 25b = 0 \)
From equation 2: \( -16a + 25b = 1 \)

If we add these two equations together:

\( (16a + 25b) + (-16a + 25b) = 0 + 1 \)
\( 50b = 1 \)
\( b = \frac{1}{50} \)

Then plugging back into equation 1:

\( 16a + 25*(1/50) = 0 \)
\( 16a + 0.5 = 0 \)
\( 16a = -0.5 \)
\( a = -0.5 / 16 = -1/32 \)

So, \( a = -1/32 \) and \( b = 1/50 \).

Therefore, in this setup, \( x_{16} = a = -1/32 \) and \( x_{76} = b = 1/50 \). Thus, the difference \( x_{76} - x_{16} = 1/50 - (-1/32) = 1/50 + 1/32 \).

Let me compute that:

\( 1/50 + 1/32 = \frac{32 + 50}{1600} = \frac{82}{1600} \)

Wait, that simplifies to \( 41/800 \) because both numerator and denominator are divisible by 2.

So, \( x_{76} - x_{16} = 41/800 \). Hmm, is that the maximum?

Wait, hold on. Maybe we can get a larger difference by distributing the negative and positive values differently.

Alternatively, perhaps instead of making all the first 16 terms equal and all the last 25 terms equal, we might have some different distribution that allows \( x_{76} \) to be larger or \( x_{16} \) to be smaller.

But actually, in the setup above, we've already set the minimal necessary negative values and maximal necessary positive values, given the constraints. Let me verify.

Wait, suppose instead that we don't set the first 16 terms all equal, but have some variation. Maybe having some negative terms beyond position 16, but then that might require other terms to be less negative, thus increasing \( x_{16} \). Similarly, if we have some positive terms before 76, that would decrease \( x_{76} \). So, it seems like the setup where all the negative terms are concentrated in the first 16 and all the positive terms are concentrated in the last 25 is indeed the optimal one for maximizing \( x_{76} - x_{16} \).

Therefore, \( x_{76} - x_{16} = 1/50 - (-1/32) = 1/50 + 1/32 = 41/800 \).

Wait, 1/50 is 0.02, 1/32 is approximately 0.03125, so adding them gives approximately 0.05125, which is 41/800 (since 800*0.05125=41). So that seems correct.

But just to double-check, let me see if this is indeed the maximum.

Is there any way to have \( x_{76} \) larger than 1/50 or \( x_{16} \) smaller than -1/32? Probably not, because if we try to make \( x_{76} \) larger, we'd have to assign more positive values to it, but that would require taking away from the positive pool, which might affect the total sum.

Similarly, if we make \( x_{16} \) smaller, that would mean assigning more negative values, which would require taking away from the negative pool, again affecting the total sum.

Hence, in this setup, the positive and negative contributions are exactly balanced to meet the sum zero condition, and the absolute sum is 1.

Therefore, 41/800 is indeed the maximum difference.

But wait, 41 and 800: are they coprime? Let me check.

The prime factors of 41: well, 41 is a prime number.

800 is 2^5 * 5^2.

41 doesn't divide 2 or 5, so yes, 41 and 800 are coprime. Therefore, the fraction is reduced completely, and \( m = 41 \), \( n = 800 \). Therefore, \( m + n = 841 \).

But wait, hold on a second. Let me double-check my calculations because 16a + 25b = 0 and 16*(-a) + 25b = 1.

So, substituting a = -1/32 and b = 1/50:

16*(-(-1/32)) + 25*(1/50) = 16*(1/32) + 25/50 = 0.5 + 0.5 = 1. Correct.

And 16a + 25b = 16*(-1/32) + 25*(1/50) = -0.5 + 0.5 = 0. Correct.

So, that's consistent.

Therefore, \( x_{76} - x_{16} = 1/50 - (-1/32) = 1/50 + 1/32 = (16 + 25)/800 = 41/800 \).

Yes, that seems right.

Wait, but let me think again—is there a way to have a larger difference?

Suppose instead of setting all first 16 terms to -1/32, and all last 25 terms to 1/50, perhaps we can have some terms beyond 76 also contributing positively, allowing \( x_{76} \) to be higher? Or maybe not, because those terms would have to be positive, but then the sum would be higher unless compensated elsewhere.

Wait, but if we have more positive terms beyond 76, that would require more negative terms before 16, but since we already have 16 terms as negative, if we have more positive terms beyond 76, we can't have more negative terms before 16 because we're limited by the total number of terms.

Alternatively, maybe if we set some of the terms from 17 to 75 to be positive as well. But if we do that, then the sum of positive terms increases, which would require even more negative terms to compensate, potentially making \( x_{16} \) smaller or larger?

Wait, let's explore that.

Suppose we have some terms from 17 to 75 also positive. Let's say we have k terms positive starting from position 17. Then, the number of negative terms would still be 16, but their magnitude could be adjusted.

But if we have more positive terms, then the total positive sum would increase, so the total negative sum would have to be more negative to keep the total sum zero. However, the total absolute sum is fixed at 1.

Wait, but if we have more positive terms, we can have a smaller magnitude of negative terms, but we can't have more than 16 negative terms because the sequence is non-decreasing. So, if we have more positive terms, those can be distributed among the later positions, but we cannot have more than 16 negative terms because otherwise, the sequence wouldn't be non-decreasing.

Therefore, the initial idea of setting the first 16 terms as negative and the last 25 as positive seems to be the optimal configuration.

Alternatively, perhaps we can spread out the negative terms over more positions but in such a way that the negative values are smaller, allowing for a larger positive spread.

Wait, but that might not help because spreading them out would require more negative terms, which would have to be smaller in magnitude, but since the sum has to stay the same, that might actually require the positive terms to be larger.

Wait, let's formalize that.

Suppose we have n negative terms, each of magnitude a, and (100 - n) positive terms, each of magnitude b.

Then, the total absolute sum is n*a + (100 - n)*b = 1.

The total sum is n*(-a) + (100 - n)*b = 0.

So, from the total sum equation:

(100 - n)*b = n*a

From the absolute sum equation:

n*a + (100 - n)*b = 1

Substitute (100 - n)*b from the first equation into the second:

n*a + n*a = 1

2n*a = 1 => a = 1/(2n)

Also, from the first equation:

b = (n*a)/(100 - n) = [n/(2n)]/(100 - n) = 1/(2(100 - n))

Therefore, b = 1/(2(100 - n))

So, in this case, a = 1/(2n), b = 1/(2(100 - n))

Therefore, the difference \( x_{76} - x_{16} \) depends on how we distribute the negative and positive terms.

But in our earlier case, n = 16, so a = 1/(2*16) = 1/32, and b = 1/(2*(100 - 16)) = 1/(2*84) = 1/168.

Wait, hold on, no—that contradicts what I had earlier.

Wait, in the earlier case, I had a = -1/32, b = 1/50, but according to this formula, if n = 16, then a = 1/(2*16) = 1/32, and b = 1/(2*(100 - 16)) = 1/(2*84) = 1/168.

But in the previous scenario, b was 1/50. So, clearly, I must have made a mistake earlier.

Wait, why is there a discrepancy?

Ah, because in my initial setup, I considered that all the negative terms are in the first 16, but in reality, if n is the number of negative terms, and each is -a, then the total negative sum is -n*a, and the total positive sum is (100 - n)*b. Then, setting -n*a + (100 - n)*b = 0, and n*a + (100 - n)*b = 1.

Wait, but that would lead to:

Total absolute sum: n*a + (100 - n)*b = 1
Total sum: -n*a + (100 - n)*b = 0

So, adding these two equations:

(n*a + (100 - n)*b) + (-n*a + (100 - n)*b) = 1 + 0
2*(100 - n)*b = 1
=> (100 - n)*b = 1/2
Similarly, subtracting the two equations:

(n*a + (100 - n)*b) - (-n*a + (100 - n)*b) = 1 - 0
2*n*a = 1
=> n*a = 1/2

So, indeed, a = 1/(2n), b = 1/(2*(100 - n))

So, in the case where n = 16, a = 1/(32), b = 1/(2*84) = 1/168.

But in my initial setup, I had a different value for b. So, that indicates that my initial assumption was wrong—the positive terms should not be 1/50, but rather 1/168.

Wait, so perhaps my initial approach was incorrect because I didn't account for all the positive terms correctly.

Wait, so let's redo this.

If n = 16, then a = 1/(2*16) = 1/32 ≈ 0.03125

And b = 1/(2*(100 - 16)) = 1/(2*84) = 1/168 ≈ 0.005952

Therefore, in this setup, \( x_{16} = -1/32 \) and \( x_{76} = 1/168 \). Thus, the difference \( x_{76} - x_{16} = 1/168 - (-1/32) = 1/168 + 1/32 \).

Compute that:

Find a common denominator, which is 168*32 = 5376.

Convert fractions:

1/168 = 32/5376

1/32 = 168/5376

Adding them: 32 + 168 = 200 => 200/5376 = 25/672 ≈ 0.0372

Wait, 25/672 is approximately 0.0372, which is much less than the 0.05125 I previously got with 41/800 ≈ 0.05125.

So, that suggests that my initial approach was wrong, and this is actually a lower difference.

Wait, that's contradictory. So, which one is correct?

Hold on, maybe I messed up the initial setup.

In my first approach, I considered that all the first 16 terms are negative, each equal to -1/32, and the last 25 terms are positive, each equal to 1/50. But according to the equations above, with n = 16, the positive terms should be 1/(2*(100 - n)) = 1/168, not 1/50.

So, where did I go wrong?

Ah! I think I confused the number of positive terms. If I have n = 16 negative terms, then the remaining 84 terms are positive. So, 84 positive terms, each equal to 1/(2*84) = 1/168.

Therefore, in the first approach, I incorrectly assumed that the positive terms were 25, but actually, if n = 16, the positive terms are 84, not 25.

Therefore, my initial calculation was incorrect because I didn't consider the correct number of positive terms.

Therefore, with n = 16, the positive terms are 84, each equal to 1/168.

Thus, \( x_{16} = -1/32 \), \( x_{76} = 1/168 \).

Therefore, the difference is \( 1/168 - (-1/32) = 1/168 + 1/32 \).

Which is 25/672 as above, which is approximately 0.0372, which is less than 41/800 ≈ 0.05125.

Therefore, in that case, my initial approach was flawed because I didn't realize that the number of positive terms is 84, not 25, when n = 16.

So, that leads me to reconsider my initial setup.

Wait, perhaps I need to model this more accurately.

Let me define:

Let’s suppose that the first k terms are negative, each equal to a, and the remaining (100 - k) terms are positive, each equal to b.

Given that the sequence is non-decreasing, so all negative terms come before positive terms.

Then, the total sum is:

Negative sum + positive sum = -k*a + (100 - k)*b = 0

Total absolute sum:

k*a + (100 - k)*b = 1

So, solving these two equations:

From the first equation:

(100 - k)*b = k*a

From the second equation:

k*a + (100 - k)*b = 1

Substituting (100 - k)*b from first equation into the second:

k*a + k*a = 1

2k*a = 1

Therefore, a = 1/(2k)

Similarly, from first equation:

(100 - k)*b = k*a = k*(1/(2k)) = 1/2

Thus, b = 1/(2*(100 - k))

Therefore, in this model, a = 1/(2k), b = 1/(2*(100 - k))

So, the difference \( x_{76} - x_{16} \) depends on where 76 and 16 fall in this sequence.

If 16 ≤ k, then \( x_{16} = a \), else \( x_{16} = 0 \) (if 16 is within the negative region). Similarly, if 76 > k, then \( x_{76} = b \); else, \( x_{76} = 0 \) (if 76 is within the negative region). Wait, but in reality, if 76 is beyond k, it's positive; if it's within the first k, it's negative.

But in our case, k is the number of negative terms, all at the beginning. So, if k ≥ 76, then \( x_{76} \) is negative; otherwise, it's positive. Similarly, if 16 < k, \( x_{16} \) is negative; else, it's zero.

Wait, hold on. Actually, in this setup, \( x_1 \) to \( x_k \) are negative, and \( x_{k+1} \) to \( x_{100} \) are positive. So, if 16 ≤ k, then \( x_{16} \) is negative; if 16 > k, then \( x_{16} \) is zero. Similarly, if 76 > k, then \( x_{76} \) is positive; otherwise, it's zero.

But in our problem, we need \( x_{76} \) to be as large as possible, so ideally, 76 should be in the positive region, so 76 > k. Similarly, to have \( x_{16} \) as small as possible (most negative), 16 should be in the negative region, so 16 ≤ k.

Therefore, to have both \( x_{16} \) negative and \( x_{76} \) positive, we need k ≥ 16 and k < 76. So, 16 ≤ k ≤ 75.

Therefore, in such a case, \( x_{16} = a = 1/(2k) \), but since it's negative, \( x_{16} = -1/(2k) \). And \( x_{76} = b = 1/(2*(100 - k)) \).

Therefore, the difference \( x_{76} - x_{16} = 1/(2*(100 - k)) - (-1/(2k)) = 1/(2*(100 - k)) + 1/(2k) \).

Factor out 1/2:

= (1/(100 - k) + 1/k) / 2

= (k + (100 - k)) / (2k(100 - k))

= 100 / (2k(100 - k))

= 50 / (k(100 - k))

So, the difference \( x_{76} - x_{16} = 50 / (k(100 - k)) \)

Interesting, so it's expressed in terms of k. So, to maximize this expression, we need to minimize the denominator \( k(100 - k) \).

Because 50 is constant, so 50 divided by a smaller number gives a larger result.

Therefore, to maximize \( x_{76} - x_{16} \), we need to minimize \( k(100 - k) \).

Given that k is an integer between 16 and 75 inclusive.

But \( k(100 - k) \) is a quadratic function in k, which opens downward, peaking at k = 50.

Therefore, the minimum occurs at the endpoints of the interval.

Since k ranges from 16 to 75, the minimum of \( k(100 - k) \) would occur at the smallest k (16) or the largest k (75).

Let me compute both:

At k = 16:

\( 16*(100 - 16) = 16*84 = 1344 \)

At k = 75:

\( 75*(100 - 75) = 75*25 = 1875 \)

So, 1344 < 1875, so the minimum is at k = 16, giving \( k(100 - k) = 1344 \).

Therefore, the maximum of \( x_{76} - x_{16} \) is 50 / 1344.

Simplify that:

Divide numerator and denominator by 2: 25 / 672

Check if 25 and 672 are coprime.

672 ÷ 25 = 26.88, not integer.

Prime factors of 672: 672 = 2^5 * 3 * 7.

25 is 5^2, which shares no common factors with 672. So yes, 25 and 672 are coprime.

Therefore, the maximum difference is 25/672, so m = 25, n = 672, m + n = 697.

Wait, hold on, but earlier, when I thought k = 16, I had a different setup where the positive terms were 84, each equal to 1/168, so the difference was 25/672, which aligns with this.

But in my initial incorrect setup, I thought the positive terms were 25, leading to a larger difference, but that was wrong because with k = 16, the positive terms are 84, not 25.

So, in fact, the maximum difference is 25/672, which is approximately 0.0372.

But wait, earlier, when I considered another method where I set the first 16 terms as -1/32 and the last 25 terms as 1/50, I got a larger difference of 41/800 ≈ 0.05125.

But according to this more accurate analysis, the maximum difference is 25/672 ≈ 0.0372.

So, which one is correct?

Wait, perhaps I need to reconcile these results.

In the first approach, I considered that all the positive terms are in the last 25, but according to this second approach, where we fix k negative terms and (100 - k) positive terms, the maximum occurs when k is as small as possible (i.e., k = 16), giving the minimal product k*(100 - k), hence the maximum difference.

However, in the first approach, I allowed for more flexibility by setting the first 16 terms as negative, the terms from 17 to 75 as zero, and the last 25 as positive. But in reality, if I allow some of the terms from 17 to 75 to be positive, then the number of negative terms remains 16, but the positive terms increase beyond 25, which would cause the positive terms to decrease further, thus reducing the difference \( x_{76} - x_{16} \).

Wait, that is, if I set more terms to be positive, then the positive terms will have to be smaller because the total positive sum is fixed at 1/2.

Wait, in the first approach, I had positive terms as 25*(1/50) = 0.5, which is correct.

But in the second approach, with k = 16, the positive terms are 84*(1/(2*84)) = 84*(1/168) = 0.5, which is also correct.

So, both approaches agree on the total positive sum.

But in the first approach, I set the positive terms as 25*(1/50) = 0.5, whereas in the second approach, with k = 16, the positive terms are 84*(1/168) = 0.5. So, same thing.

But in the first approach, I also considered that some terms from 17 to 75 could be zero, but in reality, they can be set to positive or negative, but in the second approach, we assume that once k negative terms are fixed, the rest are positive.

But in reality, the problem doesn't specify that all the negative terms have to be consecutive or that the positive terms have to be consecutive.

So, perhaps, another way to model this is to have more negative terms beyond k = 16 but interspersed with some positive terms before 76.

Wait, but how would that affect the difference \( x_{76} - x_{16} \)?

If we have more negative terms beyond 16, but before 76, then \( x_{16} \) is still determined by the most negative term, which is the 16th term. However, \( x_{76} \) might be influenced by whether there are positive terms before 76 or not.

But if we have more negative terms, the positive terms would have to be fewer to maintain the total sum, thus increasing the positive terms' magnitude. But since the sequence is non-decreasing, if you have more negative terms, the positive terms would have to start at a higher point.

Wait, let's formalize that.

Suppose we have t negative terms, which are the first t terms, each equal to a, and s positive terms, which are the last s terms, each equal to b, with t + s = 100.

But in this case, we have t negative terms and s positive terms, with t + s = 100.

But if we have t = 16, s = 84, then the positive terms are 84*(1/168) = 0.5, as before.

Alternatively, if we have t = 20, s = 80, then a = 1/(2*20) = 1/40, and b = 1/(2*80) = 1/160.

Thus, \( x_{16} = -1/40 \) and \( x_{76} = 1/160 \).

Difference is \( 1/160 - (-1/40) = 1/160 + 1/40 = 1/160 + 4/160 = 5/160 = 1/32 ≈ 0.03125 \), which is less than 25/672 ≈ 0.0372.

Similarly, if t = 16, s = 84, as before, difference is 25/672 ≈ 0.0372.

Wait, but in this case, even if we have more negative terms, the difference decreases because although \( x_{16} \) is more negative, \( x_{76} \) is less positive.

Hence, the maximum difference occurs when t is as small as possible, i.e., t = 16, giving the minimal denominator and hence the maximal difference.

Therefore, the conclusion is that 25/672 is the maximum difference, so m + n = 25 + 672 = 697.

Wait, but before finalizing this, let me just check if there is a way to have a larger difference by not assuming uniformity.

Suppose, for instance, that we have the first 16 terms as -a, and the last 25 terms as b, but some of the terms in between are also negative but closer to zero. Would that allow \( x_{76} \) to be larger?

But no, because if we have more negative terms before 76, then \( x_{76} \) would have to be greater than or equal to those negative terms. But since the sequence is non-decreasing, \( x_{76} \) can't be less than the negative terms before it, so it's either equal or positive. Therefore, to maximize \( x_{76} - x_{16} \), we need \( x_{76} \) to be as large as possible and \( x_{16} \) as small as possible.

But if we have more negative terms beyond 16, \( x_{16} \) is still just the 16th term, so it's the same as before. However, \( x_{76} \) might have to be smaller because the positive terms are spread out more.

Alternatively, if we make the first 16 terms as negative as possible, and then have all the remaining terms positive, then \( x_{76} \) is as high as possible relative to \( x_{16} \).

Wait, but if we make the first 16 terms more negative, that requires more negative mass, which would need to be compensated by more positive mass, thereby diluting the positive terms, which would reduce \( x_{76} \).

Therefore, making the first 16 terms more negative than -1/32 each would require that the positive terms be less than 1/50 each, which would make \( x_{76} \) less than 1/50, hence decreasing the difference.

Therefore, the maximum occurs when the first 16 terms are as negative as possible without making the positive terms too small, which is achieved when the first 16 terms are equally negative, and the last 25 terms are equally positive.

Therefore, my initial approach was flawed because I considered only the first 16 and last 25 terms, but failed to recognize that the positive terms would actually be more than 25 because the total number of positive terms is 84 when k = 16.

Therefore, the maximum difference is indeed 25/672, which reduces to lowest terms as 25/672, so m + n = 697.

Wait, but just to be thorough, let me test another value of k.

Suppose k = 17, so 17 negative terms, each a = 1/(2*17) ≈ 0.0294, and 83 positive terms, each b = 1/(2*83) ≈ 0.00602.

Then, \( x_{16} \) is still the 16th term, which is still a negative term, so -1/(2*17) ≈ -0.0294.

\( x_{76} \) is the 76th term, which is positive, so b = 1/(2*83) ≈ 0.00602.

Then, the difference is approximately 0.00602 - (-0.0294) ≈ 0.0354, which is less than 25/672 ≈ 0.0372.

Similarly, if we pick k = 15, but wait, k needs to be at least 16 because we need 16 terms before 76.

Wait, no, actually, in the problem, k is the number of negative terms, so to have \( x_{16} \) negative, k must be at least 16. So, k cannot be less than 16.

Therefore, the minimal k is 16, giving us the maximum difference.

Hence, after correcting my initial mistake and following through, the maximum difference is 25/672, so m + n = 25 + 672 = 697.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{697}
</think>

Given the problem, we need to find the maximum value of \( x_{76} - x_{16} \) among 100 real numbers \( x_1 \leq x_2 \leq \cdots \leq x_{100} \) such that the sum of the absolute values is 1 and the regular sum is zero.

First, we note that the sum of the absolute values being 1 and the regular sum being zero imply that the total positive sum is equal to the total negative sum, each being \( \frac{1}{2} \).

To maximize \( x_{76} - x_{16} \), we need to consider the setup where the first 16 terms are as negative as possible and the terms from 76 to 100 are as positive as possible. This setup ensures that \( x_{16} \) is minimized and \( x_{76} \) is maximized.

We define:
- \( k \) as the number of negative terms, each equal to \( a \).
- The remaining \( 100 - k \) terms as positive terms, each equal to \( b \).

Given the constraints:
1. The total sum is zero: \( -k a + (100 - k) b = 0 \).
2. The total absolute sum is 1: \( k a + (100 - k) b = 1 \).

Solving these equations, we find:
- \( a = \frac{1}{2k} \)
- \( b = \frac{1}{2(100 - k)} \)

To maximize \( x_{76} - x_{16} \), we need to minimize \( k(100 - k) \). The minimum occurs at the smallest \( k \) (which is 16) or the largest \( k \) (which is 75). Calculating both:
- At \( k = 16 \): \( 16 \times 84 = 1344 \)
- At \( k = 75 \): \( 75 \times 25 = 1875 \)

The minimum is 1344, leading to:
\[ x_{76} - x_{16} = \frac{50}{1344} = \frac{25}{672} \]

Thus, the fraction is simplified to \( \frac{25}{672} \), and the sum of the numerator and denominator is \( 25 + 672 = 697 \).

\[
\boxed{697}
\]
