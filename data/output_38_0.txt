 The problem: 
A plane contains $40$ lines, no $2$ of which are parallel. Suppose that there are $3$ points where exactly $3$ lines intersect, $4$ points where exactly $4$ lines intersect, $5$ points where exactly $5$ lines intersect, $6$ points where exactly $6$ lines intersect, and no points where more than $6$ lines intersect. Find the number of points where exactly $2$ lines intersect.


Alright, so I have this problem about a plane with 40 lines, none of which are parallel. That means every pair of lines will intersect at exactly one point, right? So normally, if all lines were in general position (meaning no two are parallel and no three meet at a single point), the number of intersection points would be the combination of 40 lines taken 2 at a time. Let me calculate that first.

The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!). Plugging in n = 40 and k = 2, we get:

C(40, 2) = 40 × 39 / 2 = (1560)/2 = 780.

So, without any intersections involving more than two lines, there would be 780 intersection points.

But in this problem, it's given that some points have multiple lines intersecting. Specifically, there are points where 3, 4, 5, or 6 lines intersect. Each such point reduces the total number of intersection points because instead of having C(m, 2) separate points from m lines, you just have 1 point. So, I need to adjust the total count accordingly.

Let me note down the given information:

- 3 points where exactly 3 lines intersect.
- 4 points where exactly 4 lines intersect.
- 5 points where exactly 5 lines intersect.
- 6 points where exactly 6 lines intersect.
- No points where more than 6 lines intersect.

I need to find the number of points where exactly 2 lines intersect.

First, let's understand how each multi-line intersection affects the total count. For a point where t lines intersect, instead of contributing C(t, 2) intersection points, it contributes just 1. So, the reduction in the number of intersection points is C(t, 2) - 1.

Therefore, for each such point, the number of fewer intersection points is:

- For t = 3: C(3, 2) - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2
- For t = 4: C(4, 2) - 1 = 6 - 1 = 5
- For t = 5: C(5, 2) - 1 = 10 - 1 = 9
- For t = 6: C(6, 2) - 1 = 15 - 1 = 14

Now, let's compute the total reduction due to all these multi-line intersections.

Number of points with 3 lines: 3 → Total reduction: 3 × 2 = 6
Number of points with 4 lines: 4 → Total reduction: 4 × 5 = 20
Number of points with 5 lines: 5 → Total reduction: 5 × 9 = 45
Number of points with 6 lines: 6 → Total reduction: 6 × 14 = 84

Adding up all these reductions: 6 + 20 + 45 + 84.

Let me compute that step by step:

6 + 20 = 26

26 + 45 = 71

71 + 84 = 155

So, the total reduction is 155 intersection points.

Therefore, the actual number of intersection points is the initial 780 minus this reduction.

Total intersection points = 780 - 155 = 625.

But wait, hold on. The question asks specifically for the number of points where exactly 2 lines intersect. So, out of the total 625 intersection points, some are from multiple lines intersecting, but we already accounted for those.

Wait, no. Actually, when we subtracted the reductions, we already included the counts where multiple lines intersect. Therefore, the remaining intersection points should all be simple intersections (where exactly two lines meet). So, the number of points where exactly two lines intersect is 625.

But let me double-check my reasoning because sometimes these problems can be tricky.

Another approach is to use the concept of incidences. In incidence geometry, the number of incidences between points and lines can be calculated in two ways.

Given n lines, each pair intersects at a unique point unless multiple lines intersect at the same point. The formula for the number of intersection points is C(n, 2) minus the overcounts at the multiple intersections.

Alternatively, we can model this using graph theory. Each line is an edge connecting two points, but since lines extend infinitely, perhaps that complicates things.

Wait, maybe not necessary here. Let me think again.

We know that each intersection point where t lines meet contributes C(t, 2) pairs of lines. Since each pair of lines corresponds to exactly one intersection point, the total number of intersection points can be related to the number of such pairs.

Wait, actually, the total number of intersection points is equal to the sum over all points of C(t_i, 2), where t_i is the number of lines through the i-th point.

That is,

Total intersection points = Σ [C(t_i, 2)] for all i.

But in our case, most points have t_i = 2, except some which have t_i = 3,4,5,6.

So, the total number of intersection points is:

Σ [C(t_i, 2)] = (number of points with t=2)*C(2,2) + (points with t=3)*C(3,2) + ... etc.

But C(2,2)=1, C(3,2)=3, C(4,2)=6, C(5,2)=10, C(6,2)=15.

Given that, we can set up the equation:

Σ [C(t_i, 2)] = Number of intersection points.

But also, another way to compute the total number of intersection points is by considering the original number of intersections C(40,2)=780, minus the overcounts.

Wait, no. Alternatively, we can express the total number of intersection points as:

Total = C(40,2) - Σ [C(t_i, 2) - 1] for all multiple intersections.

Which is consistent with what I did earlier. Because each multiple intersection point was counted C(t_i, 2) times in the initial C(40,2) count, but actually, it should be counted once. So, we subtract (C(t_i,2)-1) for each multiple intersection point.

Therefore, the total number of intersection points is indeed 780 - 155 = 625.

Thus, since all other intersection points besides those with multiplicity have t_i=2, meaning they contribute 1 each to the total count, the number of such points is exactly 625.

Hence, the number of points where exactly two lines intersect is 625.

But wait, before finalizing, let me ensure that I haven't misapplied the concepts.

Alternative method: Use the formula that relates the number of intersection points to the number of lines and their concurrent intersections.

In combinatorial geometry, the number of intersection points formed by n lines in general position is C(n,2). When multiple lines concur at a point, the number of intersection points decreases.

Each concurrence of t lines reduces the total number of intersection points by C(t,2) - 1. So, for each such point, we subtract that amount.

Given that, the calculation seems correct.

So, adding up all the reductions:

For 3 points with 3 lines: 3*(3 choose 2 - 1) = 3*(3 -1)= 3*2=6

Similarly, for 4 points with 4 lines: 4*(6 -1)=4*5=20

For 5 points with 5 lines:5*(10 -1)=5*9=45

For 6 points with 6 lines:6*(15 -1)=6*14=84

Total reduction:6+20+45+84=155

Subtracting from 780:780-155=625

Therefore, the number of points where exactly two lines intersect is 625.

Hence, after careful consideration, I conclude the answer is 625.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{625}
</think>

Given a plane with 40 lines, none of which are parallel, we need to find the number of points where exactly two lines intersect. 

First, we calculate the total number of intersection points if all lines were in general position:
\[
\binom{40}{2} = \frac{40 \times 39}{2} = 780
\]

Next, we account for the points where multiple lines intersect. These points reduce the total number of intersection points. For each point where \( t \) lines intersect, the reduction in the number of intersection points is given by:
\[
\binom{t}{2} - 1
\]

We calculate the reduction for each type of multi-line intersection:
- For 3 points where 3 lines intersect: \( 3 \times (\binom{3}{2} - 1) = 3 \times (3 - 1) = 3 \times 2 = 6 \)
- For 4 points where 4 lines intersect: \( 4 \times (\binom{4}{2} - 1) = 4 \times (6 - 1) = 4 \times 5 = 20 \)
- For 5 points where 5 lines intersect: \( 5 \times (\binom{5}{2} - 1) = 5 \times (10 - 1) = 5 \times 9 = 45 \)
- For 6 points where 6 lines intersect: \( 6 \times (\binom{6}{2} - 1) = 6 \times (15 - 1) = 6 \times 14 = 84 \)

Summing these reductions:
\[
6 + 20 + 45 + 84 = 155
\]

Subtracting the total reduction from the initial number of intersection points gives us the number of points where exactly two lines intersect:
\[
780 - 155 = 625
\]

Thus, the number of points where exactly two lines intersect is:
\[
\boxed{625}
\]
