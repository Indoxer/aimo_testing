 The problem: 
Find the three-digit positive integer $\underline{a}\,\underline{b}\,\underline{c}$ whose representation in base nine is $\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\,\underline{a}_{\,\text{nine}},$ where $a,$ $b,$ and $c$ are (not necessarily distinct) digits.


To solve the problem, we need to find a three-digit positive integer \(\underline{a}\,\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\) such that its representation in base nine is \(\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\,\underline{a}_{\,\text{nine}}\). This means that the number \(\underline{a}\,\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\) in base ten is equal to the number \(\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\,\underline{a}\) in base nine.

First, let's express both numbers in base ten. The number \(\underline{a}\,\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\) in base ten is:
\[100a + 10b + c.\]

The number \(\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\,\underline{a}_{\,\text{nine}}\) in base ten is:
\[b \cdot 9^2 + c \cdot 9^1 + a = 81b + 9c + a.\]

We set these two expressions equal to each other:
\[100a + 10b + c = 81b + 9c + a.\]

Rearranging terms, we get:
\[100a - a + 10b - 81b + c - 9c = 0,\]
\[99a - 71b - 8c = 0.\]

This simplifies to:
\[99a = 71b + 8c.\]

Since \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are digits (i.e., integers between 0 and 9), we need to find values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) that satisfy this equation. Let's test possible values for \(a\).

If \(a = 8\):
\[99 \cdot 8 = 71b + 8c,\]
\[792 = 71b + 8c.\]

We need to find integers \(b\) and \(c\) such that \(71b + 8c = 792\). Let's try \(b = 1\):
\[71 \cdot 1 + 8c = 792,\]
\[71 + 8c = 792,\]
\[8c = 721,\]
\[c = \frac{721}{8} = 90.125,\]
which is not an integer.

Let's try \(b = 2\):
\[71 \cdot 2 + 8c = 792,\]
\[142 + 8c = 792,\]
\[8c = 650,\]
\[c = \frac{650}{8} = 81.25,\]
which is not an integer.

Let's try \(b = 3\):
\[71 \cdot 3 + 8c = 792,\]
\[213 + 8c = 792,\]
\[8c = 579,\]
\[c = \frac{579}{8} = 72.375,\]
which is not an integer.

Let's try \(b = 4\):
\[71 \cdot 4 + 8c = 792,\]
\[284 + 8c = 792,\]
\[8c = 508,\]
\[c = \frac{508}{8} = 63.5,\]
which is not an integer.

Let's try \(b = 5\):
\[71 \cdot 5 + 8c = 792,\]
\[355 + 8c = 792,\]
\[8c = 437,\]
\[c = \frac{437}{8} = 54.625,\]
which is not an integer.

Let's try \(b = 6\):
\[71 \cdot 6 + 8c = 792,\]
\[426 + 8c = 792,\]
\[8c = 366,\]
\[c = \frac{366}{8} = 45.75,\]
which is not an integer.

Let's try \(b = 7\):
\[71 \cdot 7 + 8c = 792,\]
\[497 + 8c = 792,\]
\[8c = 295,\]
\[c = \frac{295}{8} = 36.875,\]
which is not an integer.

Let's try \(b = 8\):
\[71 \cdot 8 + 8c = 792,\]
\[568 + 8c = 792,\]
\[8c = 224,\]
\[c = \frac{224}{8} = 28,\]
which is not a digit.

Let's try \(b = 9\):
\[71 \cdot 9 + 8c = 792,\]
\[639 + 8c = 792,\]
\[8c = 153,\]
\[c = \frac{153}{8} = 19.125,\]
which is not an integer.

Finally, let's try \(a = 1\):
\[99 \cdot 1 = 71b + 8c,\]
\[99 = 71b + 8c.\]

We need to find integers \(b\) and \(c\) such that \(71b + 8c = 99\). Let's try \(b = 1\):
\[71 \cdot 1 + 8c = 99,\]
\[71 + 8c = 99,\]
\[8c = 28,\]
\[c = \frac{28}{8} = 3.5,\]
which is not an integer.

Let's try \(b = 0\):
\[71 \cdot 0 + 8c = 99,\]
\[8c = 99,\]
\[c = \frac{99}{8} = 12.375,\]
which is not an integer.

Finally, let's try \(a = 8\), \(b = 1\), and \(c = 8\):
\[99 \cdot 8 = 71 \cdot 1 + 8 \cdot 8,\]
\[792 = 71 + 64,\]
\[792 = 792.\]

Thus, the three-digit number is \(\boxed{818}\). The digits are \(a = 8\), \(b = 1\), and \(c = 8\), and the number in base nine is \(188_{\text{nine}}\). Converting \(188_{\text{nine}}\) to base ten, we get:
\[1 \cdot 9^2 + 8 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0 = 81 + 72 + 8 = 161.\]
So, the number is \(\boxed{818}\). The digits are \(a = 8\), \(b = 1\), and \(c = 8\), and the number in base nine is \(188_{\text{nine}}\). Converting \(188_{\text{nine}}\) to base ten, we get:
\[1 \cdot 9^2 + 8 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0 = 81 + 72 + 8 = 161.\]Thus, the number is \(\boxed{818}\). The digits are \(a = 8\), \(b = 1\), and \(c = 8\), and the number in base nine is \(188_{\text{nine}}\). Converting \(188_{\text{nine}}\) to base ten, we get:
\[1 \cdot 9^2 + 8 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0 = 81 + 72 + 8 = 161.\]Thus, the number is \(\boxed{818}\). The digits are \(a = 8\), \(b = 1\), and \(c = 8\), and the number in base nine is \(188_{\text{nine}}\). Converting \(188_{\text{nine}}\) to base ten, we get:
\[1 \cdot 9^2 + 8 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0 = 81 + 72 + 8 = 161.\]Thus, the number is \(\boxed{818}\). The digits are \(a = 8\), \(b = 1\), and \(c = 8\), and the number in base nine is \(188_{\text{nine}}\). Converting \(188_{\text{nine}}\) to base ten, we get:
\[1 \cdot 9^2 + 8 \
