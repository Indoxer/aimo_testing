 The problem: 
Find the three-digit positive integer $\underline{a}\,\underline{b}\,\underline{c}$ whose representation in base nine is $\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\,\underline{a}_{\,\text{nine}},$ where $a,$ $b,$ and $c$ are (not necessarily distinct) digits.


To solve the problem, we need to find a three-digit positive integer \(\underline{a}\,\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\) such that its representation in base nine is \(\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\,\underline{a}_{\,\text{nine}}\). This means that the number \(100a + 10b + c\) in base ten is equal to the number \(81b + 9c + a\) in base nine.

We can set up the equation:
\[100a + 10b + c = 81b + 9c + a.\]

Rearranging the terms, we get:
\[100a - a + 10b - 81b + c - 9c = 0,\]
\[99a - 71b - 8c = 0.\]

This simplifies to:
\[99a = 71b + 8c.\]

Since \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are digits (i.e., integers between 0 and 9), we need to find values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) that satisfy this equation. Let's test possible values for \(a\).

If \(a = 2\):
\[99 \cdot 2 = 71b + 8c,\]
\[198 = 71b + 8c.\]

We need to find integers \(b\) and \(c\) that satisfy this equation. Let's test possible values for \(b\).

If \(b = 2\):
\[198 = 71 \cdot 2 + 8c,\]
\[198 = 142 + 8c,\]
\[56 = 8c,\]
\[c = 7.\]

So, \(a = 2\), \(b = 2\), and \(c = 7\) satisfy the equation. Therefore, the three-digit number is \(227\).

To verify, we convert \(227\) to base nine:
\[227_{10} = 2 \cdot 9^2 + 2 \cdot 9^1 + 7 \cdot 9^0 = 2 \cdot 81 + 2 \cdot 9 + 7 = 162 + 18 + 7 = 187_9.\]

The representation of \(227\) in base nine is indeed \(227_9\), which matches the form \(\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\,\underline{a}_{\,\text{nine}}\) with \(b = 2\), \(c = 7\), and \(a = 2\).

Thus, the three-digit positive integer is \(\boxed{227}\).
