 The problem: 
Let $x,$ $y,$ and $z$ be positive real numbers satisfying the system of equations:
\begin{align*} \sqrt{2x-xy} + \sqrt{2y-xy} &= 1 \\ \sqrt{2y-yz} + \sqrt{2z-yz} &= \sqrt2 \\ \sqrt{2z-zx} + \sqrt{2x-zx} &= \sqrt3. \end{align*} 
Then $\left[ (1-x)(1-y)(1-z) \right]^2$ can be written as $\frac{m}{n},$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n.$


To solve the given system of equations, we start by analyzing each equation individually.

The first equation is:
\[
\sqrt{2x - xy} + \sqrt{2y - xy} = 1.
\]
Let's denote \(a = \sqrt{2x - xy}\) and \(b = \sqrt{2y - xy}\). Then we have:
\[
a + b = 1.
\]
Squaring both sides, we get:
\[
a^2 + b^2 + 2ab = 1.
\]
Since \(a^2 = 2x - xy\) and \(b^2 = 2y - xy\), we substitute these into the equation:
\[
(2x - xy) + (2y - xy) + 2ab = 1 \implies 2(x + y) - 2xy + 2ab = 1 \implies 2(x + y - xy) + 2ab = 1.
\]
Since \(a + b = 1\), we have \(ab = \sqrt{(2x - xy)(2y - xy)}\). However, we can simplify this by noting that if \(x = y\), then \(a = b = \frac{1}{2}\), and substituting back, we get:
\[
2x - x^2 = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 \implies 4x - 2x^2 = \frac{1}{4} \implies 16x - 8x^2 = 1 \implies 8x^2 - 16x + 1 = 0.
\]
Solving this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), we get:
\[
x = \frac{16 \pm \sqrt{256 - 32}}{16} = \frac{16 \pm \sqrt{224}}{16} = \frac{16 \pm 4\sqrt{14}}{16} = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{14}}{4}.
\]
Since \(x\) is positive, we take the smaller root:
\[
x = \frac{4 - \sqrt{14}}{4}.
\]

Now, let's consider the second equation:
\[
\sqrt{2y - yz} + \sqrt{2z - yz} = \sqrt{2}.
\]
Similarly, let \(c = \sqrt{2y - yz}\) and \(d = \sqrt{2z - yz}\). Then we have:
\[
c + d = \sqrt{2}.
\]
Squaring both sides, we get:
\[
c^2 + d^2 + 2cd = 2.
\]
Since \(c^2 = 2y - yz\) and \(d^2 = 2z - yz\), we substitute these into the equation:
\[
(2y - yz) + (2z - yz) + 2cd = 2 \implies 2(y + z) - 2yz + 2cd = 2 \implies 2(y + z - yz) + 2cd = 2.
\]
Since \(c + d = \sqrt{2}\), we have \(cd = \sqrt{(2y - yz)(2z - yz)}\). If we assume \(y = z\), then \(c = d = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\), and substituting back, we get:
\[
2y - y^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)^2 \implies 8y - 4y^2 = 2 \implies 4y^2 - 8y + 2 = 0 \implies 2y^2 - 4y + 1 = 0.
\]
Solving this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(y = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), we get:
\[
y = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{16 - 8}}{4} = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{8}}{4} = \frac{4 \pm 2\sqrt{2}}{4} = \frac{2 \pm \sqrt{2}}{2}.
\]
Since \(y\) is positive, we take the smaller root:
\[
y = \frac{2 - \sqrt{2}}{2}.
\]

Finally, let's consider the third equation:
\[
\sqrt{2z - zx} + \sqrt{2x - zx} = \sqrt{3}.
\]
Similarly, let \(e = \sqrt{2z - zx}\) and \(f = \sqrt{2x - zx}\). Then we have:
\[
e + f = \sqrt{3}.
\]
Squaring both sides, we get:
\[
e^2 + f^2 + 2ef = 3.
\]
Since \(e^2 = 2z - zx\) and \(f^2 = 2x - zx\), we substitute these into the equation:
\[
(2z - zx) + (2x - zx) + 2ef = 3 \implies 2(z + x) - 2zx + 2ef = 3 \implies 2(z + x - zx) + 2ef = 3.
\]
Since \(e + f = \sqrt{3}\), we have \(ef = \sqrt{(2z - zx)(2x - zx)}\). If we assume \(x = z\), then \(e = f = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\), and substituting back, we get:
\[
2x - x^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 \implies 8x - 4x^2 = 3 \implies 4x^2 - 8x + 3 = 0.
\]
Solving this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), we get:
\[
x = \frac{8 \pm \sqrt{64 - 48}}{8} = \frac{8 \pm \sqrt{16}}{8} = \frac{8 \pm 4}{8} = \frac{2 \pm 1}{2}.
\]
Since \(x\) is positive, we take the smaller root:
\[
x = \frac{1}{2}.
\]

Thus, we have \(x = y = z = \frac{1}{2}\). Therefore, we need to find \(\left[ (1-x)(1-y)(1-z) \right]^2\):
\[
(1-x)(1-y)(1-z) = \left(1 - \frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = \frac{1}{8}.
\]
So,
\[
\left[ (1-x)(1-y)(1-z) \right]^2 = \left( \frac{1}{8} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{64}.
\]
Thus, \(m = 1\) and \(n = 64\), and \(m+n = 65\).

The answer is:
\[
\boxed{65}.
