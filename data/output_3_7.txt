 The problem: 
For any finite set $X$, let $| X |$ denote the number of elements in $X$. Define
\[S_n = \sum | A \cap B | ,\]
where the sum is taken over all ordered pairs $(A, B)$ such that $A$ and $B$ are subsets of $\left\{ 1 , 2 , 3,  \cdots , n \right\}$ with $|A| = |B|$.
For example, $S_2 = 4$ because the sum is taken over the pairs of subsets
\[(A, B) \in \left\{ (\emptyset, \emptyset) , ( \{1\} , \{1\} ), ( \{1\} , \{2\} ) , ( \{2\} , \{1\} ) , ( \{2\} , \{2\} ) , ( \{1 , 2\} , \{1 , 2\} ) \right\} ,\]
giving $S_2 = 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 2 = 4$.
Let $\frac{S_{2022}}{S_{2021}} = \frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find the remainder when $p + q$ is divided by
1000.


To solve for \( S_n \), we need to understand the sum of the sizes of the intersections of all pairs of subsets of \(\{1, 2, \ldots, n\}\) with the same size. Let's start by considering the contribution of each element \( i \) in the set \(\{1, 2, \ldots, n\}\) to the sum \( S_n \).

For a fixed element \( i \), we need to count how many times \( i \) appears in the intersection of two subsets of the same size. If we choose two subsets \( A \) and \( B \) of size \( k \), then \( i \) will be in the intersection \( A \cap B \) if and only if \( i \) is in both \( A \) and \( B \). The number of ways to choose the remaining \( k-1 \) elements for \( A \) from the \( n-1 \) other elements is \(\binom{n-1}{k-1}\), and similarly for \( B \). Therefore, the number of ways to choose \( A \) and \( B \) such that \( i \) is in both is \(\binom{n-1}{k-1}^2\).

Since there are \(\binom{n}{k}\) ways to choose a subset of size \( k \), the total contribution of element \( i \) to \( S_n \) is:
\[
\sum_{k=1}^n \binom{n-1}{k-1}^2 \binom{n}{k}
\]
We can simplify this expression by noting that \(\binom{n}{k} = \binom{n}{n-k}\), so the sum can be rewritten as:
\[
\sum_{k=1}^n \binom{n-1}{k-1}^2 \binom{n}{k} = \sum_{k=1}^n \binom{n-1}{k-1}^2 \binom{n}{n-k+1}
\]
By reindexing the sum, we get:
\[
\sum_{k=1}^n \binom{n-1}{k-1}^2 \binom{n}{k} = \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \binom{n-1}{k}^2 \binom{n}{k+1}
\]
Using the identity \(\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\), we can see that the sum is equal to \( n \cdot 2^{n-2} \). Therefore, the total contribution of all elements to \( S_n \) is \( n \cdot 2^{n-2} \cdot n = n^2 \cdot 2^{n-2} \).

Thus, we have:
\[
S_n = n^2 \cdot 2^{n-2}
\]
Now, we need to find \( \frac{S_{2022}}{S_{2021}} \):
\[
\frac{S_{2022}}{S_{2021}} = \frac{2022^2 \cdot 2^{2020}}{2021^2 \cdot 2^{2019}} = \frac{2022^2}{2021^2} \cdot 2 = \frac{4088244}{4084441} \cdot 2 = \frac{8176488}{4084441}
\]
The fraction \(\frac{8176488}{4084441}\) is already in its simplest form because 8176488 and 4084441 are coprime. Therefore, \( p = 8176488 \) and \( q = 4084441 \), and we need to find the remainder when \( p + q = 12260929 \) is divided by 1000:
\[
12260929 \mod 1000 = 929
\]
Thus, the answer is:
\[
\boxed{929}
\]
