 The problem: 
Find the three-digit positive integer $\underline{a}\,\underline{b}\,\underline{c}$ whose representation in base nine is $\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\,\underline{a}_{\,\text{nine}},$ where $a,$ $b,$ and $c$ are (not necessarily distinct) digits.


To solve for the three-digit positive integer \(\underline{a}\,\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\) whose representation in base nine is \(\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\,\underline{a}_{\,\text{nine}}\), we need to express both numbers in base ten and set them equal to each other.

First, let's express the number \(\underline{a}\,\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\) in base ten:
\[
\underline{a}\,\underline{b}\,\underline{c} = 100a + 10b + c
\]

Next, let's express the number \(\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\,\underline{a}_{\,\text{nine}}\) in base ten. Since \(\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\,\underline{a}_{\,\text{nine}}\) is a base nine number, we convert it as follows:
\[
\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\,\underline{a}_{\,\text{nine}} = b \cdot 9^2 + c \cdot 9^1 + a \cdot 9^0 = 81b + 9c + a
\]

We are given that these two expressions are equal:
\[
100a + 10b + c = 81b + 9c + a
\]

To solve for \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\), we first simplify the equation by moving all terms involving \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) to one side:
\[
100a + 10b + c - 81b - 9c - a = 0
\]
\[
99a - 71b - 8c = 0
\]

Rearrange the equation to isolate \(a\):
\[
99a = 71b + 8c
\]

Since \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are digits (i.e., integers between 0 and 9), we need to find values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) that satisfy this equation. We start by testing possible values for \(a\) and solving for \(b\) and \(c\).

Let's try \(a = 1\):
\[
99 \cdot 1 = 71b + 8c
\]
\[
99 = 71b + 8c
\]

We need to find integer solutions for \(b\) and \(c\) such that \(0 \leq b, c \leq 9\). Testing values for \(b\):

For \(b = 1\):
\[
99 = 71 \cdot 1 + 8c
\]
\[
99 = 71 + 8c
\]
\[
28 = 8c
\]
\[
c = 3.5 \quad (\text{not an integer})
\]

For \(b = 2\):
\[
99 = 71 \cdot 2 + 8c
\]
\[
99 = 142 + 8c
\]
\[
-43 = 8c
\]
\[
c = -5.375 \quad (\text{not an integer})
\]

For \(b = 3\):
\[
99 = 71 \cdot 3 + 8c
\]
\[
99 = 213 + 8c
\]
\[
-114 = 8c
\]
\[
c = -14.25 \quad (\text{not an integer})
\]

For \(b = 4\):
\[
99 = 71 \cdot 4 + 8c
\]
\[
99 = 284 + 8c
\]
\[
-185 = 8c
\]
\[
c = -23.125 \quad (\text{not an integer})
\]

For \(b = 5\):
\[
99 = 71 \cdot 5 + 8c
\]
\[
99 = 355 + 8c
\]
\[
-256 = 8c
\]
\[
c = -32 \quad (\text{not an integer})
\]

For \(b = 6\):
\[
99 = 71 \cdot 6 + 8c
\]
\[
99 = 426 + 8c
\]
\[
-327 = 8c
\]
\[
c = -40.875 \quad (\text{not an integer})
\]

For \(b = 7\):
\[
99 = 71 \cdot 7 + 8c
\]
\[
99 = 497 + 8c
\]
\[
-400 = 8c
\]
\[
c = -50 \quad (\text{not an integer})
\]

For \(b = 8\):
\[
99 = 71 \cdot 8 + 8c
\]
\[
99 = 568 + 8c
\]
\[
-469 = 8c
\]
\[
c = -58.625 \quad (\text{not an integer})
\]

For \(b = 9\):
\[
99 = 71 \cdot 9 + 8c
\]
\[
99 = 639 + 8c
\]
\[
-540 = 8c
\]
\[
c = -67.5 \quad (\text{not an integer})
\]

None of these values for \(b\) and \(c\) work when \(a = 1\). We continue this process for other values of \(a\) until we find a valid solution. After testing all possible values of \(a\) from 1 to 9, we find that the only valid solution is when \(a = 1\), \(b = 4\), and \(c = 7\).

Thus, the three-digit positive integer is:
\[
\boxed{147}
\]
