 The problem: 
Find the three-digit positive integer $\underline{a}\,\underline{b}\,\underline{c}$ whose representation in base nine is $\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\,\underline{a}_{\,\text{nine}},$ where $a,$ $b,$ and $c$ are (not necessarily distinct) digits.


To solve the problem, we need to find a three-digit positive integer \(\underline{a}\,\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\) such that its representation in base nine is \(\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\,\underline{a}_{\,\text{nine}}\). This means that the number \(100a + 10b + c\) in decimal is equal to the number \(81b + 9c + a\) in base nine.

We can set up the equation:
\[100a + 10b + c = 81b + 9c + a.\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[99a - 71b - 8c = 0.\]
This simplifies to:
\[99a = 71b + 8c.\]
Since \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are digits (0 through 8 for \(b\) and \(c\) and 1 through 9 for \(a\)), we need to find values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) that satisfy this equation. We will test possible values of \(a\) starting from the largest possible digit (since 99 is the largest coefficient).

If \(a = 8\):
\[99 \cdot 8 = 792.\]
So, we need:
\[792 = 71b + 8c.\]
We can check if there are integer solutions for \(b\) and \(c\). Dividing 792 by 71 gives approximately 11.18, so let's try \(b = 11\):
\[71 \cdot 11 = 781,\]
and then:
\[792 - 781 = 11.\]
So, \(8c = 11\) is not possible since \(c\) must be an integer.

If \(a = 7\):
\[99 \cdot 7 = 693.\]
So, we need:
\[693 = 71b + 8c.\]
Dividing 693 by 71 gives approximately 9.77, so let's try \(b = 9\):
\[71 \cdot 9 = 639,\]
and then:
\[693 - 639 = 54.\]
So, \(8c = 54\) is not possible since \(c\) must be an integer.

If \(a = 6\):
\[99 \cdot 6 = 594.\]
So, we need:
\[594 = 71b + 8c.\]
Dividing 594 by 71 gives approximately 8.36, so let's try \(b = 8\):
\[71 \cdot 8 = 568,\]
and then:
\[594 - 568 = 26.\]
So, \(8c = 26\) is not possible since \(c\) must be an integer.

If \(a = 5\):
\[99 \cdot 5 = 495.\]
So, we need:
\[495 = 71b + 8c.\]
Dividing 495 by 71 gives approximately 7.00, so let's try \(b = 7\):
\[71 \cdot 7 = 497,\]
and then:
\[495 - 497 = -2.\]
So, \(8c = -2\) is not possible since \(c\) must be a non-negative integer.

If \(a = 4\):
\[99 \cdot 4 = 396.\]
So, we need:
\[396 = 71b + 8c.\]
Dividing 396 by 71 gives approximately 5.57, so let's try \(b = 5\):
\[71 \cdot 5 = 355,\]
and then:
\[396 - 355 = 41.\]
So, \(8c = 41\) is not possible since \(c\) must be an integer.

If \(a = 3\):
\[99 \cdot 3 = 297.\]
So, we need:
\[297 = 71b + 8c.\]
Dividing 297 by 71 gives approximately 4.17, so let's try \(b = 4\):
\[71 \cdot 4 = 284,\]
and then:
\[297 - 284 = 13.\]
So, \(8c = 13\) is not possible since \(c\) must be an integer.

If \(a = 2\):
\[99 \cdot 2 = 198.\]
So, we need:
\[198 = 71b + 8c.\]
Dividing 198 by 71 gives approximately 2.79, so let's try \(b = 2\):
\[71 \cdot 2 = 142,\]
and then:
\[198 - 142 = 56.\]
So, \(8c = 56\) is possible, and \(c = 7\).

Thus, the solution is \(a = 2\), \(b = 2\), and \(c = 7\), so the number is \(227\).

The answer is \(\boxed{227}\).
