 The problem: 
Three spheres with radii $11$, $13$, and $19$ are mutually externally tangent. A plane intersects the spheres in three congruent circles centered at $A$, $B$, and $C$, respectively, and the centers of the spheres all lie on the same side of this plane. Suppose that $AB^2 = 560$. Find $AC^2$.


To solve the problem, we need to find the distance between the centers of the spheres and use the given information about the intersecting plane to find \( AC^2 \).

First, let's denote the centers of the spheres as \( O_1 \), \( O_2 \), and \( O_3 \) with radii \( r_1 = 11 \), \( r_2 = 13 \), and \( r_3 = 19 \), respectively. Since the spheres are mutually externally tangent, the distances between their centers are:
\[
O_1O_2 = r_1 + r_2 = 11 + 13 = 24
\]
\[
O_2O_3 = r_2 + r_3 = 13 + 19 = 32
\]
\[
O_3O_1 = r_3 + r_1 = 19 + 11 = 30
\]

Next, consider the plane that intersects the spheres in three congruent circles centered at points \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \). Since these circles are congruent, the distances from the centers of the spheres to the plane are equal. Let \( d_1 \), \( d_2 \), and \( d_3 \) be the distances from \( O_1 \), \( O_2 \), and \( O_3 \) to the plane, respectively. We know that:
\[
d_1 = d_2 = d_3 = d
\]

The distances between the points \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) on the circles are given by:
\[
AB^2 = (r_1 - d)^2 + (r_2 - d)^2 - 2(r_1 - d)(r_2 - d)\cos(\theta)
\]
\[
BC^2 = (r_2 - d)^2 + (r_3 - d)^2 - 2(r_2 - d)(r_3 - d)\cos(\theta)
\]
\[
CA^2 = (r_3 - d)^2 + (r_1 - d)^2 - 2(r_3 - d)(r_1 - d)\cos(\theta)
\]

However, since the circles are congruent and the centers of the spheres lie on the same side of the plane, we can simplify the problem by considering the distances between the centers of the spheres directly. Given \( AB^2 = 560 \), we need to find \( AC^2 \).

Using the fact that the distances between the centers of the spheres are fixed, we can use the Pythagorean theorem in the context of the right triangles formed by the centers of the spheres and the points of intersection on the plane. The distance between any two points on the circles is related to the distance between the centers of the spheres minus twice the projection of the radius onto the plane.

Given \( AB^2 = 560 \), we can use the relationship:
\[
AB^2 = O_1O_2^2 - 4d^2
\]
\[
560 = 24^2 - 4d^2
\]
\[
560 = 576 - 4d^2
\]
\[
4d^2 = 16
\]
\[
d^2 = 4
\]
\[
d = 2
\]

Now, we need to find \( AC^2 \):
\[
AC^2 = O_1O_3^2 - 4d^2
\]
\[
AC^2 = 30^2 - 4 \times 4
\]
\[
AC^2 = 900 - 16
\]
\[
AC^2 = 884
\]

Thus, the value of \( AC^2 \) is:
\[
\boxed{884}
\]
