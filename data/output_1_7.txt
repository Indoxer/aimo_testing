 The problem: 
Three spheres with radii $11$, $13$, and $19$ are mutually externally tangent. A plane intersects the spheres in three congruent circles centered at $A$, $B$, and $C$, respectively, and the centers of the spheres all lie on the same side of this plane. Suppose that $AB^2 = 560$. Find $AC^2$.


To solve for \( AC^2 \), we start by considering the geometry of the problem. We have three spheres with radii \( r_1 = 11 \), \( r_2 = 13 \), and \( r_3 = 19 \) that are mutually externally tangent. A plane intersects these spheres in three congruent circles centered at points \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \), respectively.

First, we need to determine the distances between the centers of the spheres. Let the centers of the spheres be \( O_1 \), \( O_2 \), and \( O_3 \). The distances between the centers are:
\[
O_1O_2 = r_1 + r_2 = 11 + 13 = 24,
\]
\[
O_2O_3 = r_2 + r_3 = 13 + 19 = 32,
\]
\[
O_3O_1 = r_3 + r_1 = 19 + 11 = 30.
\]

Next, we consider the plane that intersects the spheres. Since the circles are congruent and centered at \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \), the distances from the centers of the spheres to the plane are proportional to the radii of the spheres. Let the distances from \( O_1 \), \( O_2 \), and \( O_3 \) to the plane be \( d_1 \), \( d_2 \), and \( d_3 \), respectively. We know that:
\[
d_1^2 + AB^2 = r_1^2,
\]
\[
d_2^2 + AB^2 = r_2^2,
\]
\[
d_3^2 + AB^2 = r_3^2.
\]

Given \( AB^2 = 560 \), we substitute this into the equations:
\[
d_1^2 + 560 = 11^2 = 121,
\]
\[
d_2^2 + 560 = 13^2 = 169,
\]
\[
d_3^2 + 560 = 19^2 = 361.
\]

Solving for \( d_1^2 \), \( d_2^2 \), and \( d_3^2 \):
\[
d_1^2 = 121 - 560 = -439 \quad (\text{This is not possible since } d_1^2 \text{ must be non-negative}),
\]
\[
d_2^2 = 169 - 560 = -391 \quad (\text{This is not possible since } d_2^2 \text{ must be non-negative}),
\]
\[
d_3^2 = 361 - 560 = -199 \quad (\text{This is not possible since } d_3^2 \text{ must be non-negative}).
\]

Since the distances \( d_1 \), \( d_2 \), and \( d_3 \) cannot be real numbers, we need to re-evaluate our approach. Instead, we use the fact that the distances between the centers of the spheres are fixed, and the distances from the centers to the plane are proportional to the radii. Therefore, we can use the Pythagorean theorem in the plane formed by the centers and the intersection points.

We need to find \( AC^2 \). Using the fact that the circles are congruent and the distances between the centers are fixed, we can use the following relationship:
\[
AC^2 = (r_3 - r_1)^2 + AB^2.
\]

Substituting the known values:
\[
AC^2 = (19 - 11)^2 + 560 = 8^2 + 560 = 64 + 560 = 624.
\]

Thus, the value of \( AC^2 \) is:
\[
\boxed{624}.
\]
