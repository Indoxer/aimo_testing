 The problem: 
Given $\triangle ABC$ and a point $P$ on one of its sides, call line $\ell$ the $\textit{splitting line}$ of $\triangle ABC$ through $P$ if $\ell$ passes through $P$ and divides $\triangle ABC$ into two polygons of equal perimeter. Let $\triangle ABC$ be a triangle where $BC = 219$ and $AB$ and $AC$ are positive integers. Let $M$ and $N$ be the midpoints of $\overline{AB}$ and $\overline{AC},$ respectively, and suppose that the splitting lines of $\triangle ABC$ through $M$ and $N$ intersect at $30^\circ.$ Find the perimeter of $\triangle ABC.$


To solve the problem, we need to understand the properties of the splitting lines and how they relate to the given conditions. Let's start by analyzing the given information and the geometric properties of the triangle.

Given:
- $\triangle ABC$ with $BC = 219$ and $AB$ and $AC$ as positive integers.
- $M$ and $N$ are the midpoints of $\overline{AB}$ and $\overline{AC}$, respectively.
- The splitting lines of $\triangle ABC$ through $M$ and $N$ intersect at $30^\circ$.

First, let's denote the lengths of the sides of the triangle as follows:
- $AB = c$
- $AC = b$
- $BC = a = 219$

Since $M$ and $N$ are midpoints, we have:
- $AM = \frac{c}{2}$
- $AN = \frac{b}{2}$

The splitting lines through $M$ and $N$ divide $\triangle ABC$ into two polygons of equal perimeter. This implies that the sum of the perimeters of the two resulting polygons is equal to the perimeter of $\triangle ABC$. Therefore, each polygon has a perimeter of:
\[
\frac{a + b + c}{2}
\]

Next, we need to consider the intersection of the splitting lines at $30^\circ$. This intersection point is the centroid of the triangle, which is the point where the medians intersect. The centroid divides each median in the ratio 2:1.

To find the perimeter of $\triangle ABC$, we need to use the fact that the splitting lines through $M$ and $N$ intersect at $30^\circ$. This angle condition provides a constraint on the geometry of the triangle.

Using the properties of the centroid and the given angle, we can derive the following relationship:
\[
\cos(30^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]

This angle condition can be used to set up an equation involving the sides of the triangle. However, a more straightforward approach is to use the fact that the splitting lines through the midpoints of the sides of a triangle intersect at $30^\circ$ if and only if the triangle is equilateral.

For an equilateral triangle, all sides are equal. Therefore, we have:
\[
a = b = c = 219
\]

Thus, the perimeter of $\triangle ABC$ is:
\[
a + b + c = 219 + 219 + 219 = 657
\]

Therefore, the perimeter of $\triangle ABC$ is:
\[
\boxed{657}
\]
