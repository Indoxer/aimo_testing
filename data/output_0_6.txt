 The problem: 
Quadratic polynomials $P(x)$ and $Q(x)$ have leading coefficients $2$ and $-2,$ respectively. The graphs of both polynomials pass through the two points $(16,54)$ and $(20,53).$ Find $P(0) + Q(0).$


To solve for \( P(0) + Q(0) \), we start by expressing the quadratic polynomials \( P(x) \) and \( Q(x) \) in their general forms:
\[ P(x) = 2x^2 + ax + b \]
\[ Q(x) = -2x^2 + cx + d \]

We know that both polynomials pass through the points \((16, 54)\) and \((20, 53)\). This gives us the following system of equations for \( P(x) \):
\[ 2(16)^2 + 16a + b = 54 \]
\[ 2(20)^2 + 20a + b = 53 \]

Simplifying these equations, we get:
\[ 512 + 16a + b = 54 \]
\[ 800 + 20a + b = 53 \]

Subtracting the first equation from the second, we eliminate \( b \):
\[ (800 + 20a + b) - (512 + 16a + b) = 53 - 54 \]
\[ 288 + 4a = -1 \]
\[ 4a = -289 \]
\[ a = -\frac{289}{4} \]

Now substitute \( a = -\frac{289}{4} \) back into the first equation:
\[ 512 + 16\left(-\frac{289}{4}\right) + b = 54 \]
\[ 512 - 1156 + b = 54 \]
\[ -644 + b = 54 \]
\[ b = 698 \]

So, the polynomial \( P(x) \) is:
\[ P(x) = 2x^2 - \frac{289}{4}x + 698 \]

Next, we use the same method to find the coefficients for \( Q(x) \):
\[ -2(16)^2 + 16c + d = 54 \]
\[ -2(20)^2 + 20c + d = 53 \]

Simplifying these equations, we get:
\[ -512 + 16c + d = 54 \]
\[ -800 + 20c + d = 53 \]

Subtracting the first equation from the second, we eliminate \( d \):
\[ ( -800 + 20c + d ) - ( -512 + 16c + d ) = 53 - 54 \]
\[ -288 + 4c = -1 \]
\[ 4c = 287 \]
\[ c = \frac{287}{4} \]

Now substitute \( c = \frac{287}{4} \) back into the first equation:
\[ -512 + 16\left(\frac{287}{4}\right) + d = 54 \]
\[ -512 + 1148 + d = 54 \]
\[ 636 + d = 54 \]
\[ d = -582 \]

So, the polynomial \( Q(x) \) is:
\[ Q(x) = -2x^2 + \frac{287}{4}x - 582 \]

Finally, we need to find \( P(0) + Q(0) \):
\[ P(0) = 698 \]
\[ Q(0) = -582 \]
\[ P(0) + Q(0) = 698 - 582 = 116 \]

Thus, the answer is:
\[ \boxed{116} \]
