 The problem: 
Given $\triangle ABC$ and a point $P$ on one of its sides, call line $\ell$ the $\textit{splitting line}$ of $\triangle ABC$ through $P$ if $\ell$ passes through $P$ and divides $\triangle ABC$ into two polygons of equal perimeter. Let $\triangle ABC$ be a triangle where $BC = 219$ and $AB$ and $AC$ are positive integers. Let $M$ and $N$ be the midpoints of $\overline{AB}$ and $\overline{AC},$ respectively, and suppose that the splitting lines of $\triangle ABC$ through $M$ and $N$ intersect at $30^\circ.$ Find the perimeter of $\triangle ABC.$


To solve the problem, we need to understand the properties of the splitting lines and how they relate to the given triangle and its midpoints.

First, let's denote the lengths of the sides of the triangle as follows:
- \( AB = c \)
- \( AC = b \)
- \( BC = a = 219 \)

The midpoints \( M \) and \( N \) of \( \overline{AB} \) and \( \overline{AC} \) respectively divide these sides into equal halves:
- \( AM = MB = \frac{c}{2} \)
- \( AN = NC = \frac{b}{2} \)

The splitting lines through \( M \) and \( N \) divide \( \triangle ABC \) into two polygons of equal perimeter. Since these lines intersect at \( 30^\circ \), we can use this information to find the relationship between the sides of the triangle.

### Step 1: Perimeter Division
The splitting lines through \( M \) and \( N \) divide \( \triangle ABC \) into two regions with equal perimeters. Let \( P \) be the point on \( BC \) such that the line through \( M \) and \( N \) intersects \( BC \) at \( P \).

### Step 2: Midpoint Properties
Since \( M \) and \( N \) are midpoints, the line segment \( MN \) is parallel to \( BC \) and half its length:
\[ MN = \frac{a}{2} = \frac{219}{2} = 109.5 \]

### Step 3: Intersection Angle
The intersection of the splitting lines at \( 30^\circ \) suggests a specific geometric configuration. We need to use this angle to find the relationship between the sides of the triangle.

### Step 4: Using Trigonometry
Consider the triangle formed by \( M \), \( N \), and the intersection point of the splitting lines. This triangle has angles \( 30^\circ \) and \( 90^\circ \) (since \( MN \parallel BC \) and the intersection forms a right angle with \( MN \)).

### Step 5: Applying the Law of Cosines
We can use the Law of Cosines in the triangle formed by \( M \), \( N \), and the intersection point to find the lengths of \( AB \) and \( AC \). However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that the splitting lines divide the triangle into two regions of equal perimeter.

### Step 6: Equal Perimeter Condition
Since the splitting lines divide \( \triangle ABC \) into two regions of equal perimeter, we have:
\[ \text{Perimeter of } \triangle ABM + \text{Perimeter of } \triangle ACM = \text{Perimeter of } \triangle ABN + \text{Perimeter of } \triangle ACN \]

Given that \( M \) and \( N \) are midpoints, the perimeters of \( \triangle ABM \) and \( \triangle ACM \) are:
\[ \text{Perimeter of } \triangle ABM = \frac{c}{2} + \frac{b}{2} + AM = \frac{c}{2} + \frac{b}{2} + \frac{c}{2} = c + \frac{b}{2} \]
\[ \text{Perimeter of } \triangle ACM = \frac{c}{2} + \frac{b}{2} + AN = \frac{c}{2} + \frac{b}{2} + \frac{b}{2} = \frac{c}{2} + b \]

Similarly, for \( \triangle ABN \) and \( \triangle ACN \):
\[ \text{Perimeter of } \triangle ABN = \frac{c}{2} + \frac{b}{2} + BN = \frac{c}{2} + \frac{b}{2} + \frac{b}{2} = \frac{c}{2} + b \]
\[ \text{Perimeter of } \triangle ACN = \frac{c}{2} + \frac{b}{2} + AM = \frac{c}{2} + \frac{b}{2} + \frac{c}{2} = c + \frac{b}{2} \]

### Step 7: Solving for \( c \) and \( b \)
From the equal perimeter condition:
\[ c + \frac{b}{2} = \frac{c}{2} + b \]
Multiplying through by 2 to clear the fractions:
\[ 2c + b = c + 2b \]
\[ c = b \]

Thus, \( c = b \). Therefore, \( \triangle ABC \) is an isosceles triangle with \( AB = AC \).

### Step 8: Finding the Perimeter
Since \( AB = AC = b \) and \( BC = 219 \), the perimeter of \( \triangle ABC \) is:
\[ \text{Perimeter} = AB + AC + BC = b + b + 219 = 2b + 219 \]

### Step 9: Determining \( b \)
Given that \( AB \) and \( AC \) are positive integers, we need to find \( b \) such that the triangle inequality holds:
\[ AB + AC > BC \]
\[ 2b > 219 \]
\[ b > 109.5 \]

Since \( b \) must be an integer, the smallest possible value for \( b \) is 110. Therefore, the perimeter is:
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2(110) + 219 = 220 + 219 = 439 \]

Thus, the perimeter of \( \triangle ABC \) is:
\[
\boxed{439}
\]
