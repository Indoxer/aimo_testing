 The problem: 
Let $S$ be the set of all rational numbers that can be expressed as a repeating decimal in the form $0.\overline{abcd},$ where at least one of the digits $a,$ $b,$ $c,$ or $d$ is nonzero. Let $N$ be the number of distinct numerators obtained when numbers in $S$ are written as fractions in lowest terms. For example, both $4$ and $410$ are counted among the distinct numerators for numbers in $S$ because $0.\overline{3636} = \frac{4}{11}$ and $0.\overline{1230} = \frac{410}{3333}.$ Find the remainder when $N$ is divided by $1000.$


To solve this problem, we need to understand the structure of the repeating decimals and their corresponding fractions. A repeating decimal of the form \(0.\overline{abcd}\) can be expressed as a fraction. Specifically, if we let \(x = 0.\overline{abcd}\), then we have:

\[ x = \frac{abcd}{9999} \]

where \(abcd\) is the four-digit number formed by the digits \(a, b, c,\) and \(d\). Since \(abcd\) ranges from 1 to 9999 (as at least one digit is nonzero), the fraction \(\frac{abcd}{9999}\) is in its simplest form if and only if the greatest common divisor (gcd) of \(abcd\) and 9999 is 1. The number 9999 factors as:

\[ 9999 = 3^2 \times 11 \times 101 \]

Thus, for \(\frac{abcd}{9999}\) to be in its simplest form, \(abcd\) must not be divisible by 3, 11, or 101. We need to count the number of such integers from 1 to 9999.

First, we calculate the total number of integers from 1 to 9999, which is 9999. Next, we use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find the number of integers in this range that are divisible by 3, 11, or 101.

The number of multiples of 3 in the range from 1 to 9999 is:

\[ \left\lfloor \frac{9999}{3} \right\rfloor = 3333 \]

The number of multiples of 11 in the range from 1 to 9999 is:

\[ \left\lfloor \frac{9999}{11} \right\rfloor = 909 \]

The number of multiples of 101 in the range from 1 to 9999 is:

\[ \left\lfloor \frac{9999}{101} \right\rfloor = 99 \]

The number of multiples of \(3 \times 11 = 33\) in the range from 1 to 9999 is:

\[ \left\lfloor \frac{9999}{33} \right\rfloor = 303 \]

The number of multiples of \(3 \times 101 = 303\) in the range from 1 to 9999 is:

\[ \left\lfloor \frac{9999}{303} \right\rfloor = 33 \]

The number of multiples of \(11 \times 101 = 1111\) in the range from 1 to 9999 is:

\[ \left\lfloor \frac{9999}{1111} \right\rfloor = 9 \]

The number of multiples of \(3 \times 11 \times 101 = 3333\) in the range from 1 to 9999 is:

\[ \left\lfloor \frac{9999}{3333} \right\rfloor = 3 \]

Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, the number of integers from 1 to 9999 that are divisible by 3, 11, or 101 is:

\[ 3333 + 909 + 99 - 303 - 33 - 9 + 3 = 3995 \]

Therefore, the number of integers from 1 to 9999 that are not divisible by 3, 11, or 101 is:

\[ 9999 - 3995 = 6004 \]

Thus, the number of distinct numerators obtained when numbers in \(S\) are written as fractions in lowest terms is 6004. The remainder when 6004 is divided by 1000 is:

\[ 6004 \mod 1000 = 4 \]

So, the answer is:

\[ \boxed{4} \]
