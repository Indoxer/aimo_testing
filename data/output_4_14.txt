 The problem: 
Let $S$ be the set of all rational numbers that can be expressed as a repeating decimal in the form $0.\overline{abcd},$ where at least one of the digits $a,$ $b,$ $c,$ or $d$ is nonzero. Let $N$ be the number of distinct numerators obtained when numbers in $S$ are written as fractions in lowest terms. For example, both $4$ and $410$ are counted among the distinct numerators for numbers in $S$ because $0.\overline{3636} = \frac{4}{11}$ and $0.\overline{1230} = \frac{410}{3333}.$ Find the remainder when $N$ is divided by $1000.$


To solve this problem, we need to understand the structure of the repeating decimals of the form \(0.\overline{abcd}\), where \(a, b, c,\) and \(d\) are digits and at least one of them is nonzero. Such a repeating decimal can be expressed as a fraction:

\[0.\overline{abcd} = \frac{abcd}{9999},\]

where \(abcd\) represents the four-digit number formed by the digits \(a, b, c,\) and \(d\). Since \(abcd\) ranges from 1000 to 9999 (as at least one digit is nonzero), the numerator \(n\) of the fraction in its lowest terms must be a divisor of some number between 1000 and 9999.

The key is to determine how many distinct numerators are possible after reducing these fractions to their lowest terms. To do this, we need to consider the prime factorization of 9999:

\[9999 = 3^2 \times 11 \times 101.\]

When a number \(n\) is divided by the greatest common divisor (gcd) of \(n\) and 9999, the resulting numerator will be coprime with 9999. Therefore, we need to count the number of integers between 1 and 9999 that are coprime with 9999. This is given by Euler's totient function \(\phi(9999)\):

\[\phi(9999) = 9999 \left(1 - \frac{1}{3}\right)\left(1 - \frac{1}{11}\right)\left(1 - \frac{1}{101}\right) = 9999 \cdot \frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{10}{11} \cdot \frac{100}{101} = 6000.\]

Thus, there are 6000 distinct numerators when the fractions are written in lowest terms. The problem asks for the remainder when \(N\) is divided by 1000. Since \(N = 6000\), we have:

\[6000 \mod 1000 = 0.\]

Therefore, the remainder when \(N\) is divided by 1000 is \(\boxed{0}\).
