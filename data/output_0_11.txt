 The problem: 
Quadratic polynomials $P(x)$ and $Q(x)$ have leading coefficients $2$ and $-2,$ respectively. The graphs of both polynomials pass through the two points $(16,54)$ and $(20,53).$ Find $P(0) + Q(0).$


To find \( P(0) + Q(0) \), we start by expressing the quadratic polynomials \( P(x) \) and \( Q(x) \) in their general forms. Since \( P(x) \) has a leading coefficient of 2 and \( Q(x) \) has a leading coefficient of -2, we can write:
\[ P(x) = 2x^2 + ax + b \]
\[ Q(x) = -2x^2 + cx + d \]

We know that both polynomials pass through the points \((16, 54)\) and \((20, 53)\). This gives us the following system of equations for \( P(x) \):
\[ P(16) = 2(16)^2 + 16a + b = 54 \]
\[ P(20) = 2(20)^2 + 20a + b = 53 \]

Simplifying these equations, we get:
\[ 512 + 16a + b = 54 \implies 16a + b = -458 \quad \text{(1)} \]
\[ 800 + 20a + b = 53 \implies 20a + b = -747 \quad \text{(2)} \]

Subtracting equation (1) from equation (2), we get:
\[ (20a + b) - (16a + b) = -747 - (-458) \]
\[ 4a = -289 \implies a = -\frac{289}{4} \]

Substituting \( a = -\frac{289}{4} \) back into equation (1):
\[ 16\left(-\frac{289}{4}\right) + b = -458 \]
\[ -1156 + b = -458 \implies b = 698 \]

So, the polynomial \( P(x) \) is:
\[ P(x) = 2x^2 - \frac{289}{4}x + 698 \]

Next, we use the same method to find the coefficients for \( Q(x) \):
\[ Q(16) = -2(16)^2 + 16c + d = 54 \]
\[ Q(20) = -2(20)^2 + 20c + d = 53 \]

Simplifying these equations, we get:
\[ -512 + 16c + d = 54 \implies 16c + d = 566 \quad \text{(3)} \]
\[ -800 + 20c + d = 53 \implies 20c + d = 853 \quad \text{(4)} \]

Subtracting equation (3) from equation (4), we get:
\[ (20c + d) - (16c + d) = 853 - 566 \]
\[ 4c = 287 \implies c = \frac{287}{4} \]

Substituting \( c = \frac{287}{4} \) back into equation (3):
\[ 16\left(\frac{287}{4}\right) + d = 566 \]
\[ 1148 + d = 566 \implies d = -582 \]

So, the polynomial \( Q(x) \) is:
\[ Q(x) = -2x^2 + \frac{287}{4}x - 582 \]

Finally, we need to find \( P(0) + Q(0) \):
\[ P(0) = 698 \]
\[ Q(0) = -582 \]
\[ P(0) + Q(0) = 698 - 582 = 116 \]

Thus, the answer is:
\[ \boxed{116} \]
