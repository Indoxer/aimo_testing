 The problem: 
Quadratic polynomials $P(x)$ and $Q(x)$ have leading coefficients $2$ and $-2,$ respectively. The graphs of both polynomials pass through the two points $(16,54)$ and $(20,53).$ Find $P(0) + Q(0).$


Alright, so I've got this problem here about quadratic polynomials P(x) and Q(x). Their leading coefficients are 2 and -2 respectively. Both of their graphs pass through the points (16, 54) and (20, 53). I need to find P(0) + Q(0). Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.

First off, since they're quadratic polynomials, they have the general form:

For P(x): \( P(x) = 2x^2 + bx + c \)

And for Q(x): \( Q(x) = -2x^2 + dx + e \)

So, each has a quadratic term with coefficients 2 and -2, followed by linear terms with some coefficients b and d, and constant terms c and e. My goal is to find P(0) + Q(0), which would be c + e because P(0) is just c and Q(0) is just e. So, if I can figure out what c and e are, adding them together will give me the answer.

Now, both polynomials pass through the points (16, 54) and (20, 53). That means when x is 16, P(16) = 54 and Q(16) = 54 as well. Similarly, when x is 20, P(20) = 53 and Q(20) = 53. So, essentially, both polynomials satisfy these equations:

For P(x):
1. \( 2(16)^2 + b(16) + c = 54 \)
2. \( 2(20)^2 + b(20) + c = 53 \)

For Q(x):
3. \( -2(16)^2 + d(16) + e = 54 \)
4. \( -2(20)^2 + d(20) + e = 53 \)

So now I have four equations, but actually, since both quadratics share the same two points, maybe I can pair the equations from P(x) and Q(x) together?

Wait, hold on, perhaps it's better to consider that both quadratics pass through these points, so maybe we can set up a system of equations where the differences between the quadratics can help us solve for the unknowns. Let me think.

Let’s denote the difference between P(x) and Q(x). Since both pass through those points, maybe subtracting one equation from the other could lead somewhere? Alternatively, maybe subtracting the two functions at those points.

But before that, perhaps it's better to write down all four equations explicitly.

Starting with P(x):

1. \( 2(16)^2 + 16b + c = 54 \)
2. \( 2(20)^2 + 20b + c = 53 \)

Similarly, for Q(x):

3. \( -2(16)^2 + 16d + e = 54 \)
4. \( -2(20)^2 + 20d + e = 53 \)

Calculating the constants:

First, compute \( 2(16)^2 \):

\( 2*256 = 512 \)

Then, \( 2(20)^2 = 2*400 = 800 \)

Similarly, \( -2(16)^2 = -512 \)

And \( -2(20)^2 = -800 \)

So substituting back into the equations:

Equation 1: 512 + 16b + c = 54

Equation 2: 800 + 20b + c = 53

Equation 3: -512 + 16d + e = 54

Equation 4: -800 + 20d + e = 53

Okay, so now Equations 1 and 2 are for P(x), Equations 3 and 4 for Q(x).

So, perhaps I can solve for b and c first using Equations 1 and 2, then solve for d and e using Equations 3 and 4.

Starting with P(x):

Equation 1: 512 + 16b + c = 54

Equation 2: 800 + 20b + c = 53

Let me rewrite these:

From Equation 1:

16b + c = 54 - 512

Which is 16b + c = -458

Similarly, Equation 2:

20b + c = 53 - 800

Which is 20b + c = -747

Now, subtract Equation 1 from Equation 2 to eliminate c:

(20b + c) - (16b + c) = (-747) - (-458)

This simplifies to:

4b = (-747 + 458) = (-289)

Therefore, 4b = -289 => b = -289 / 4 = -72.25

Hmm, not the nicest number, but it's a fraction. Let me keep it as a fraction for precision.

So, b = -289/4.

Now plug this back into Equation 1 to find c.

From Equation 1: 16b + c = -458

So, 16*(-289/4) + c = -458

Calculate 16*(289/4): 16 divided by 4 is 4, so 4*289 = 1156

So, 16*(-289/4) = -1156

Thus, -1156 + c = -458

Therefore, c = -458 + 1156 = 698

So, c = 698.

So, P(x) is defined as \( 2x^2 - (289/4)x + 698 \)

Similarly, moving on to Q(x):

Equation 3: -512 + 16d + e = 54

Equation 4: -800 + 20d + e = 53

Again, let's rewrite these:

Equation 3: 16d + e = 54 + 512 = 566

Equation 4: 20d + e = 53 + 800 = 853

So, Equation 3: 16d + e = 566

Equation 4: 20d + e = 853

Subtract Equation 3 from Equation 4 to eliminate e:

(20d + e) - (16d + e) = 853 - 566

Which gives 4d = 287

Thus, d = 287 / 4 = 71.75

Again, a fractional coefficient, but okay.

Now, substitute back into Equation 3 to find e.

From Equation 3: 16d + e = 566

16*(287/4) + e = 566

Calculate 16*(287/4): 16 divided by 4 is 4, so 4*287 = 1148

So, 1148 + e = 566

Therefore, e = 566 - 1148 = -582

So, e = -582

Thus, Q(x) is \( -2x^2 + (287/4)x - 582 \)

Now, the question asks for P(0) + Q(0). As established earlier, P(0) is c = 698, and Q(0) is e = -582.

Adding them together: 698 + (-582) = 116

Wait, that seems straightforward. But let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.

Starting with P(x):

Equation 1: 512 + 16b + c = 54

16b + c = 54 - 512 = -458

Equation 2: 800 + 20b + c = 53

20b + c = 53 - 800 = -747

Subtracting Equation 1 from Equation 2:

4b = (-747) - (-458) = -747 + 458 = -289

Hence, b = -289/4. Correct.

Then plugging back into Equation 1:

16*(-289/4) = -4*289 = -1156

So, -1156 + c = -458 => c = 698. Correct.

For Q(x):

Equation 3: -512 + 16d + e = 54

16d + e = 54 + 512 = 566

Equation 4: -800 + 20d + e = 53

20d + e = 53 + 800 = 853

Subtracting Equation 3 from Equation 4:

4d = 853 - 566 = 287

Hence, d = 287/4. Correct.

Then plugging back into Equation 3:

16*(287/4) = 4*287 = 1148

So, 1148 + e = 566 => e = -582. Correct.

Therefore, P(0) + Q(0) = 698 + (-582) = 116.

Hmm, 116. That seems like the right answer, but just to be thorough, let me verify whether these quadratics actually pass through the given points.

Testing P(x):

At x=16:

\( 2*(16)^2 + (-289/4)*16 + 698 \)

Compute each term:

2*256 = 512

(-289/4)*16 = -289*4 = -1156

Plus 698.

So, total: 512 - 1156 + 698 = (512 + 698) - 1156 = 1210 - 1156 = 54. Correct.

At x=20:

2*(400) + (-289/4)*20 + 698

2*400 = 800

(-289/4)*20 = -289*5 = -1445

Plus 698.

Total: 800 - 1445 + 698 = (800 + 698) - 1445 = 1498 - 1445 = 53. Correct.

Testing Q(x):

At x=16:

-2*(256) + (287/4)*16 + (-582)

Compute each term:

-512

(287/4)*16 = 287*4 = 1148

-582

Total: -512 + 1148 - 582 = (1148 - 512) - 582 = 636 - 582 = 54. Correct.

At x=20:

-2*(400) + (287/4)*20 + (-582)

Compute each term:

-800

(287/4)*20 = 287*5 = 1435

-582

Total: -800 + 1435 - 582 = (1435 - 800) - 582 = 635 - 582 = 53. Correct.

Everything checks out. So, P(0) is 698, Q(0) is -582, their sum is 116.

I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning or calculations, so I'm confident the answer is 116.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{116}
</think>

Given quadratic polynomials \( P(x) \) and \( Q(x) \) with leading coefficients 2 and -2 respectively, we know they pass through the points \((16, 54)\) and \((20, 53)\). We need to find \( P(0) + Q(0) \).

The general forms of the polynomials are:
\[ P(x) = 2x^2 + bx + c \]
\[ Q(x) = -2x^2 + dx + e \]

Using the given points, we set up the following equations:

For \( P(x) \):
1. \( 2(16)^2 + 16b + c = 54 \)
2. \( 2(20)^2 + 20b + c = 53 \)

For \( Q(x) \):
3. \( -2(16)^2 + 16d + e = 54 \)
4. \( -2(20)^2 + 20d + e = 53 \)

Calculating the constants:
- \( 2(16)^2 = 512 \)
- \( 2(20)^2 = 800 \)
- \( -2(16)^2 = -512 \)
- \( -2(20)^2 = -800 \)

Rewriting the equations:
1. \( 512 + 16b + c = 54 \)
2. \( 800 + 20b + c = 53 \)
3. \( -512 + 16d + e = 54 \)
4. \( -800 + 20d + e = 53 \)

Solving for \( b \) and \( c \):
- From equations 1 and 2:
  - \( 16b + c = -458 \)
  - \( 20b + c = -747 \)
  - Subtracting these: \( 4b = -289 \) ⟹ \( b = -\frac{289}{4} \)
  - Substituting \( b \) back: \( 16(-\frac{289}{4}) + c = -458 \) ⟹ \( -1156 + c = -458 \) ⟹ \( c = 698 \)

Solving for \( d \) and \( e \):
- From equations 3 and 4:
  - \( 16d + e = 566 \)
  - \( 20d + e = 853 \)
  - Subtracting these: \( 4d = 287 \) ⟹ \( d = \frac{287}{4} \)
  - Substituting \( d \) back: \( 16(\frac{287}{4}) + e = 566 \) ⟹ \( 1148 + e = 566 \) ⟹ \( e = -582 \)

Thus, \( P(0) = c = 698 \) and \( Q(0) = e = -582 \). Therefore, \( P(0) + Q(0) = 698 + (-582) = 116 \).

\[
