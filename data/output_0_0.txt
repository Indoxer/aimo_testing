 The problem: 
Quadratic polynomials $P(x)$ and $Q(x)$ have leading coefficients $2$ and $-2,$ respectively. The graphs of both polynomials pass through the two points $(16,54)$ and $(20,53).$ Find $P(0) + Q(0).$


Alright, so I need to solve this problem where we have two quadratic polynomials, P(x) and Q(x), with leading coefficients 2 and -2 respectively. Both of their graphs pass through the points (16,54) and (20,53). I need to find P(0) + Q(0).

Hmm, okay. Let me break this down step by step.

First, let's recall that a quadratic polynomial has the general form:
\[ P(x) = ax^2 + bx + c \]
Similarly for Q(x):
\[ Q(x) = dx^2 + ex + f \]

Given that P(x) has a leading coefficient of 2, so a = 2. Similarly, Q(x) has a leading coefficient of -2, so d = -2.

So we can write:
\[ P(x) = 2x^2 + bx + c \]
\[ Q(x) = -2x^2 + ex + f \]

Now, both P(x) and Q(x) pass through the points (16,54) and (20,53). That means when we plug in x=16 into P(x), we get 54, and similarly for x=20, we get 53. The same goes for Q(x).

So let's set up equations for each polynomial at these points.

Starting with P(x):

1. When x = 16, P(16) = 54:
\[ 2(16)^2 + b(16) + c = 54 \]
Let me calculate 2*(16)^2 first. 16 squared is 256, times 2 is 512. So,
\[ 512 + 16b + c = 54 \]
Subtracting 512 from both sides:
\[ 16b + c = 54 - 512 \]
\[ 16b + c = -458 \]  --- Equation (1)

2. When x = 20, P(20) = 53:
\[ 2(20)^2 + b(20) + c = 53 \]
Calculating 2*(20)^2: 20 squared is 400, times 2 is 800.
So,
\[ 800 + 20b + c = 53 \]
Subtracting 800 from both sides:
\[ 20b + c = 53 - 800 \]
\[ 20b + c = -747 \]  --- Equation (2)

Now, we have two equations for P(x):
Equation (1): 16b + c = -458
Equation (2): 20b + c = -747

To find b and c, subtract Equation (1) from Equation (2):
(20b + c) - (16b + c) = (-747) - (-458)
This simplifies to:
4b = -747 + 458
Calculate -747 + 458. Hmm, 747 - 458 is 289, so since it's negative, it's -289.
Thus:
4b = -289
Divide both sides by 4:
b = -289 / 4
Which is equal to -72.25. Hmm, okay, seems like a decimal, but that's fine.

Now, substitute b back into Equation (1) to find c.

From Equation (1):
16*(-72.25) + c = -458

Compute 16 * (-72.25). Let's do 16*72 = 1152, and 16*0.25=4, so total is 1152 + 4 = 1156. But since it's negative, it's -1156.

So,
-1156 + c = -458
Add 1156 to both sides:
c = -458 + 1156
Calculate that: 1156 - 458. Let's see, 1156 - 400 = 756, then minus 58 more is 698.

So c = 698.

Therefore, P(x) is fully determined as:
\[ P(x) = 2x^2 - 72.25x + 698 \]

Wait, 72.25 is a decimal; maybe I should represent it as a fraction? Since 72.25 is equal to 72 and 1/4, which is 289/4. So, b = -289/4, which is the fractional form.

So P(x) becomes:
\[ P(x) = 2x^2 - \frac{289}{4}x + 698 \]

Alright, now moving on to Q(x). It has leading coefficient -2, so:
\[ Q(x) = -2x^2 + ex + f \]

Again, since both points (16,54) and (20,53) lie on Q(x), we can set up similar equations.

1. When x = 16, Q(16) = 54:
\[ -2(16)^2 + e(16) + f = 54 \]
Compute -2*(16)^2: 16 squared is 256, multiplied by -2 is -512.
So,
\[ -512 + 16e + f = 54 \]
Adding 512 to both sides:
\[ 16e + f = 54 + 512 \]
\[ 16e + f = 566 \]  --- Equation (3)

2. When x = 20, Q(20) = 53:
\[ -2(20)^2 + e(20) + f = 53 \]
Compute -2*(20)^2: 20 squared is 400, times -2 is -800.
So,
\[ -800 + 20e + f = 53 \]
Adding 800 to both sides:
\[ 20e + f = 53 + 800 \]
\[ 20e + f = 853 \]  --- Equation (4)

Now, subtract Equation (3) from Equation (4):
(20e + f) - (16e + f) = 853 - 566
Simplify:
4e = 287
Therefore:
e = 287 / 4
Which is equal to 71.75 or as a fraction, 287/4.

Now, plug e back into Equation (3) to find f.

From Equation (3):
16*(287/4) + f = 566

Compute 16*(287/4). 16 divided by 4 is 4, so 4*287 = 1148.

Thus:
1148 + f = 566
Subtract 1148 from both sides:
f = 566 - 1148
Calculate that: 1148 - 566 is 582, so f = -582.

Therefore, Q(x) is:
\[ Q(x) = -2x^2 + \frac{287}{4}x - 582 \]

Okay, so now we have both polynomials P(x) and Q(x). The next step is to find P(0) + Q(0).

But wait, P(0) is simply the constant term c, because plugging x=0 into any polynomial gives the constant term. Similarly, Q(0) is the constant term f.

From earlier, we found c = 698 and f = -582.

So, P(0) = 698 and Q(0) = -582.

Therefore, P(0) + Q(0) = 698 + (-582) = 698 - 582.

Calculating that: 698 - 582. Let's see, 698 - 500 = 198, then subtract 82 more: 198 - 82 = 116.

Wait, hold on, 582 is 500 + 82, so yes, 698 - 582 is indeed 116.

So, the sum is 116.

But just to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors along the way, let me verify my steps.

Starting with P(x):

We had two equations:

1. 16b + c = -458
2. 20b + c = -747

Subtracting gave 4b = -289 => b = -289/4 = -72.25

Then, substituting back:

16*(-72.25) = -1156, so -1156 + c = -458 => c = 698. Correct.

For Q(x):

Two equations:

1. 16e + f = 566
2. 20e + f = 853

Subtracting gave 4e = 287 => e = 287/4 = 71.75

Substituting back:

16*(287/4) = 4*287 = 1148. Then 1148 + f = 566 => f = -582. Correct.

Thus, P(0) is 698, Q(0) is -582. Adding them together: 698 - 582 = 116. Looks solid.

Alternatively, another approach could be noticing that P(x) + Q(x) would be a quadratic polynomial with leading coefficient 2 + (-2) = 0. So actually, P(x) + Q(x) is a linear polynomial. Hmm, interesting thought.

Let me explore that a bit. If I define S(x) = P(x) + Q(x), then:

S(x) = [2x² + bx + c] + [-2x² + ex + f] = (2 - 2)x² + (b + e)x + (c + f) = (b + e)x + (c + f)

So indeed, S(x) is a linear function: S(x) = (b + e)x + (c + f)

Since S(x) is linear, it can be written as S(x) = mx + k, where m = b + e and k = c + f.

If I can compute S(x), perhaps I can find k, which is exactly P(0) + Q(0).

But how?

Well, we know that both P and Q pass through (16,54) and (20,53). Therefore, S(x) must pass through the sum of those points, right?

Meaning, for x = 16, S(16) = P(16) + Q(16) = 54 + 54 = 108.

Similarly, for x = 20, S(20) = P(20) + Q(20) = 53 + 53 = 106.

So, S(x) is a linear function passing through (16,108) and (20,106).

Therefore, we can find the equation of S(x) using these two points.

First, compute the slope m:

m = (106 - 108)/(20 - 16) = (-2)/4 = -0.5

So, the slope is -1/2.

Now, using point-slope form. Let's take point (16,108):

S(x) - 108 = -1/2 (x - 16)

Thus,

S(x) = -1/2 x + 8 + 108
Simplify: 8 + 108 is 116, so S(x) = -1/2 x + 116

Therefore, S(x) is a linear function with slope -1/2 and y-intercept 116.

Hence, S(x) = (-1/2)x + 116

But remember, S(x) was defined as P(x) + Q(x) = (b + e)x + (c + f)

Comparing, we can see that:

(b + e) = -1/2 and (c + f) = 116

But wait, our goal was to find P(0) + Q(0) which is c + f, which is exactly 116.

Wow, that's a much quicker method!

So instead of going through all the algebra to find b, c, e, f individually, recognizing that P(x) + Q(x) is linear and using the given points to compute its equation is smarter.

Therefore, without needing to find b, c, e, f separately, we can immediately say that P(0) + Q(0) is 116.

That's clever! I didn't think about adding the polynomials initially, but once I realized that their sum is linear, it simplified everything.

So, either way, whether solving for each coefficient individually or recognizing the linear combination, the result is the same: 116.

I think that's solid. So, confident with that answer.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{116}
</think>

Given quadratic polynomials \( P(x) \) and \( Q(x) \) with leading coefficients 2 and -2 respectively, both passing through the points \((16, 54)\) and \((20, 53)\), we need to find \( P(0) + Q(0) \).

First, we express the polynomials:
\[ P(x) = 2x^2 + bx + c \]
\[ Q(x) = -2x^2 + ex + f \]

We set up the equations for \( P(x) \) using the given points:
1. \( 2(16)^2 + 16b + c = 54 \)
   \[ 512 + 16b + c = 54 \]
   \[ 16b + c = -458 \]
2. \( 2(20)^2 + 20b + c = 53 \)
   \[ 800 + 20b + c = 53 \]
   \[ 20b + c = -747 \]

Subtracting these equations:
\[ 4b = -289 \]
\[ b = -\frac{289}{4} \]

Substituting \( b \) back:
\[ 16(-\frac{289}{4}) + c = -458 \]
\[ -1156 + c = -458 \]
\[ c = 698 \]

Next, for \( Q(x) \):
1. \( -2(16)^2 + 16e + f = 54 \)
   \[ -512 + 16e + f = 54 \]
   \[ 16e + f = 566 \]
2. \( -2(20)^2 + 20e + f = 53 \)
   \[ -800 + 20e + f = 53 \]
   \[ 20e + f = 853 \]

Subtracting these equations:
\[ 4e = 287 \]
\[ e = \frac{287}{4} \]

Substituting \( e \) back:
\[ 16(\frac{287}{4}) + f = 566 \]
\[ 1148 + f = 566 \]
\[ f = -582 \]

Thus, \( P(0) = c = 698 \) and \( Q(0) = f = -582 \). Therefore, \( P(0) + Q(0) = 698 + (-582) = 116 \).

Recognizing that \( P(x) + Q(x) \) is a linear polynomial, we verify:
\[ S(x) = (b + e)x + (c + f) \]
Using points \((16, 108)\) and \((20, 106)\), we find the slope and intercept:
\[ m = \frac{106 - 108}{20 - 16} = -\frac{1}{2} \]
\[ S(x) = -\frac{1}{2}x + 116 \]

Thus, \( P(0) + Q(0) = 116 \).

\[
\boxed{116}
\]
