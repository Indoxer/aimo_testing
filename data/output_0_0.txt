 The problem: 
Quadratic polynomials $P(x)$ and $Q(x)$ have leading coefficients $2$ and $-2,$ respectively. The graphs of both polynomials pass through the two points $(16,54)$ and $(20,53).$ Find $P(0) + Q(0).$


Alright, so I've got this problem about quadratic polynomials P(x) and Q(x). Their leading coefficients are 2 and -2, respectively. Both of their graphs pass through the points (16,54) and (20,53). I need to find P(0) + Q(0). Hmm, okay.

Let me start by recalling that a quadratic polynomial has the general form P(x) = ax² + bx + c, where a is the leading coefficient. Similarly, Q(x) would be something like Q(x) = dx² + ex + f. Since we know the leading coefficients, for P(x) it's 2, so P(x) = 2x² + bx + c. For Q(x), the leading coefficient is -2, so Q(x) = -2x² + ex + f.

Both polynomials pass through the points (16,54) and (20,53). That means if we plug in x=16 into P(x), we get 54, and similarly for Q(x). Same with x=20, giving us 53. So, let me write down these equations.

For P(x):

1) When x=16, P(16)=54:
2*(16)² + b*16 + c = 54

2) When x=20, P(20)=53:
2*(20)² + b*20 + c = 53

Similarly, for Q(x):

3) When x=16, Q(16)=54:
-2*(16)² + e*16 + f = 54

4) When x=20, Q(20)=53:
-2*(20)² + e*20 + f = 53

So, now I have four equations:

From P(x):
Equation 1: 2*(256) + 16b + c = 54
Equation 2: 2*(400) + 20b + c = 53

From Q(x):
Equation 3: -2*(256) + 16e + f = 54
Equation 4: -2*(400) + 20e + f = 53

Let me compute the constants first.

Compute Equation 1:
2*256 = 512, so:
512 + 16b + c = 54
Which simplifies to:
16b + c = 54 - 512 = -458

Equation 2:
2*400 = 800, so:
800 + 20b + c = 53
Simplifying:
20b + c = 53 - 800 = -747

Similarly for Equations 3 and 4.

Equation 3:
-2*256 = -512, so:
-512 + 16e + f = 54
Which gives:
16e + f = 54 + 512 = 566

Equation 4:
-2*400 = -800, so:
-800 + 20e + f = 53
Simplifying:
20e + f = 53 + 800 = 853

Okay, so now we have simplified systems for P(x) and Q(x).

For P(x):
16b + c = -458  ...(A)
20b + c = -747  ...(B)

Subtract equation (A) from equation (B) to eliminate c:
(20b + c) - (16b + c) = (-747) - (-458)
That's 4b = (-747 + 458)
Calculate -747 + 458. Let's see, 747 - 458 is 289, so negative is -289.

Therefore, 4b = -289 => b = -289 / 4

Hmm, that's a fraction. Let me compute that: 289 divided by 4 is 72.25, so b = -72.25 or -289/4.

Then, substitute back into equation (A): 16b + c = -458

So, 16*(-289/4) + c = -458

Compute 16*(289/4) first: 16 divided by 4 is 4, so 4*289 = 1156

So, 16b = -1156, thus:

-1156 + c = -458

So, c = -458 + 1156 = 698

Alright, so P(x) is fully determined: P(x) = 2x² - (289/4)x + 698

Now, moving on to Q(x):

We have:
16e + f = 566  ...(C)
20e + f = 853  ...(D)

Again, subtract (C) from (D):

(20e + f) - (16e + f) = 853 - 566
Which is 4e = 287

Thus, e = 287 / 4 = 71.75 or 287/4

Now, substitute back into equation (C): 16e + f = 566

Compute 16*(287/4) = 4*287 = 1148

Hence, 1148 + f = 566

Therefore, f = 566 - 1148 = -582

So, Q(x) is Q(x) = -2x² + (287/4)x - 582

Now, we need to find P(0) + Q(0). 

But wait, P(0) is just c, which is 698, and Q(0) is just f, which is -582. So, adding them together:

698 + (-582) = 698 - 582 = 116

Wait, hold on, let me double-check my calculations because 698 - 582 is indeed 116?

Yes, 698 minus 500 is 198, then minus 82 more is 116. Yeah, that seems right.

But let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in solving for b and e.

In P(x):

Equation A: 16b + c = -458

Equation B: 20b + c = -747

Subtracting gives 4b = -289, so b = -289/4.

Then, plugging back in:

16*(-289/4) = -4*289 = -1156

So, c = -458 + 1156 = 698. That looks correct.

For Q(x):

Equation C: 16e + f = 566

Equation D: 20e + f = 853

Subtracting gives 4e = 287, so e = 287/4.

Plugging back in:

16*(287/4) = 4*287 = 1148

Thus, f = 566 - 1148 = -582. Correct.

So, P(0) = c = 698, Q(0) = f = -582. Sum is 698 - 582 = 116.

Alternatively, maybe there's another way without finding all coefficients?

Wait, perhaps since both quadratics pass through the same two points, the difference between them might be a linear function? Let me think.

If I consider R(x) = P(x) - Q(x). Then R(x) is a quadratic minus another quadratic, so it's also a quadratic. But since both P and Q pass through the same two points, (16,54) and (20,53), then R(16) = 0 and R(20) = 0. Therefore, R(x) has roots at x=16 and x=20, so it can be written as R(x) = k(x -16)(x -20), where k is some constant.

But let's see, R(x) = P(x) - Q(x) = [2x² + bx + c] - [-2x² + ex + f] = 4x² + (b - e)x + (c - f)

But R(x) is equal to k(x -16)(x -20). Let's expand that:

k(x² -36x + 320)

So, R(x) = kx² -36kx + 320k

Comparing to our earlier expression for R(x):

4x² + (b - e)x + (c - f) = kx² -36kx + 320k

So, equate coefficients:

4 = k

Then, coefficient of x: (b - e) = -36k = -36*4 = -144

And constant term: (c - f) = 320k = 320*4 = 1280

So, we have c - f = 1280

But we already found c = 698 and f = -582, so c - f = 698 - (-582) = 698 + 582 = 1280, which matches. So that checks out.

Additionally, from b - e = -144, but we had b = -289/4 and e = 287/4.

So, b - e = (-289/4) - (287/4) = (-289 - 287)/4 = (-576)/4 = -144. Which also matches. So, that confirms our previous calculations.

Thus, R(x) = 4x² -144x + 1280, which is consistent with k=4.

So, another way to approach this problem is to realize that P(0) + Q(0) = c + f. And since c - f = 1280, and we can find c + f if we have another equation. Wait, do we know anything else about c and f?

Alternatively, maybe not, unless we use other relations.

Wait, but since we already have c = 698 and f = -582, adding them gives 116, as before.

I think either way, whether going through each coefficient or considering R(x), we end up with the same result.

So, after thorough calculation, I believe P(0) + Q(0) is 116.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{116}
</think>

Given quadratic polynomials \( P(x) \) and \( Q(x) \) with leading coefficients 2 and -2, respectively, both passing through the points (16, 54) and (20, 53). We need to find \( P(0) + Q(0) \).

First, we express the polynomials:
\[ P(x) = 2x^2 + bx + c \]
\[ Q(x) = -2x^2 + ex + f \]

Using the given points, we set up the following equations:

For \( P(x) \):
1. \( 2(16)^2 + 16b + c = 54 \)
2. \( 2(20)^2 + 20b + c = 53 \)

For \( Q(x) \):
3. \( -2(16)^2 + 16e + f = 54 \)
4. \( -2(20)^2 + 20e + f = 53 \)

Simplifying these equations:

For \( P(x) \):
1. \( 512 + 16b + c = 54 \) ⟹ \( 16b + c = -458 \)
2. \( 800 + 20b + c = 53 \) ⟹ \( 20b + c = -747 \)

Subtracting the first equation from the second:
\[ 4b = -289 \] ⟹ \( b = -\frac{289}{4} \)

Substituting \( b \) back into the first equation:
\[ 16\left(-\frac{289}{4}\right) + c = -458 \] ⟹ \( -1156 + c = -458 \) ⟹ \( c = 698 \)

For \( Q(x) \):
3. \( -512 + 16e + f = 54 \) ⟹ \( 16e + f = 566 \)
4. \( -800 + 20e + f = 53 \) ⟹ \( 20e + f = 853 \)

Subtracting the third equation from the fourth:
\[ 4e = 287 \] ⟹ \( e = \frac{287}{4} \)

Substituting \( e \) back into the third equation:
\[ 16\left(\frac{287}{4}\right) + f = 566 \] ⟹ \( 1148 + f = 566 \) ⟹ \( f = -582 \)

Thus, \( P(0) = c = 698 \) and \( Q(0) = f = -582 \). Therefore, \( P(0) + Q(0) = 698 + (-582) = 116 \).

\[
\boxed{116}
\]
