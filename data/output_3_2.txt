 The problem: 
For any finite set $X$, let $| X |$ denote the number of elements in $X$. Define
\[S_n = \sum | A \cap B | ,\]
where the sum is taken over all ordered pairs $(A, B)$ such that $A$ and $B$ are subsets of $\left\{ 1 , 2 , 3,  \cdots , n \right\}$ with $|A| = |B|$.
For example, $S_2 = 4$ because the sum is taken over the pairs of subsets
\[(A, B) \in \left\{ (\emptyset, \emptyset) , ( \{1\} , \{1\} ), ( \{1\} , \{2\} ) , ( \{2\} , \{1\} ) , ( \{2\} , \{2\} ) , ( \{1 , 2\} , \{1 , 2\} ) \right\} ,\]
giving $S_2 = 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 2 = 4$.
Let $\frac{S_{2022}}{S_{2021}} = \frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find the remainder when $p + q$ is divided by
1000.


To find \( S_n \), we start by considering the sum over all ordered pairs \((A, B)\) where \(A\) and \(B\) are subsets of \(\{1, 2, \ldots, n\}\) with \(|A| = |B|\). For a fixed subset \(A\) of size \(k\), there are \(\binom{n}{k}\) ways to choose \(A\). For each such \(A\), there are also \(\binom{n}{k}\) ways to choose \(B\). Therefore, for each fixed \(k\), the contribution to \(S_n\) from all pairs \((A, B)\) of size \(k\) is \(\binom{n}{k}^2 k\).

Thus, we have:
\[
S_n = \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k}^2 k.
\]

We can use the identity \(\sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k}^2 k = n \sum_{k=1}^n \binom{n-1}{k-1} \binom{n}{k} = n \sum_{k=1}^n \binom{n-1}{k-1} \binom{n}{k} = n \sum_{j=0}^{n-1} \binom{n-1}{j} \binom{n}{j+1} = n \sum_{j=0}^{n-1} \binom{n-1}{j} \binom{n}{n-j-1} = n \sum_{j=0}^{n-1} \binom{n-1}{j} \binom{n}{j+1} = n \sum_{j=0}^{n-1} \binom{n-1}{j} \binom{n}{j+1} = n \cdot 2^{n-1}.
\]

So, we have:
\[
S_n = n \cdot 2^{n-1}.
\]

Now, we need to find \(\frac{S_{2022}}{S_{2021}}\):
\[
\frac{S_{2022}}{S_{2021}} = \frac{2022 \cdot 2^{2021}}{2021 \cdot 2^{2020}} = \frac{2022 \cdot 2}{2021} = \frac{4044}{2021}.
\]

Since 4044 and 2021 are relatively prime, we have \(p = 4044\) and \(q = 2021\). We need to find the remainder when \(p + q = 4044 + 2021 = 6065\) is divided by 1000:
\[
6065 \mod 1000 = 65.
\]

Thus, the answer is:
\[
\boxed{65}.
\]
