 The problem: 
In isosceles trapezoid $ABCD$, parallel bases $\overline{AB}$ and $\overline{CD}$ have lengths $500$ and $650$, respectively, and $AD=BC=333$. The angle bisectors of $\angle{A}$ and $\angle{D}$ meet at $P$, and the angle bisectors of $\angle{B}$ and $\angle{C}$ meet at $Q$. Find $PQ$.


To find the length of \(PQ\) in the isosceles trapezoid \(ABCD\), we start by noting that the trapezoid has parallel bases \(AB = 500\) and \(CD = 650\), with non-parallel sides \(AD = BC = 333\). The angle bisectors of \(\angle A\) and \(\angle D\) meet at point \(P\), and the angle bisectors of \(\angle B\) and \(\angle C\) meet at point \(Q\).

First, we need to determine the height of the trapezoid. Drop perpendiculars from points \(A\) and \(B\) to line \(CD\), meeting \(CD\) at points \(E\) and \(F\) respectively. This creates two right triangles \(ADE\) and \(BCF\) with \(DE = CF\) and \(EF = AB = 500\). Therefore, \(CD = DE + EF + CF = DE + 500 + DE = 2DE + 500\). Since \(CD = 650\), we have:
\[2DE + 500 = 650 \implies 2DE = 150 \implies DE = 75.\]
Now, in the right triangle \(ADE\), we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the height \(h\):
\[AD^2 = DE^2 + h^2 \implies 333^2 = 75^2 + h^2 \implies 110889 = 5625 + h^2 \implies h^2 = 105264 \implies h = \sqrt{105264} = 324.\]
So, the height of the trapezoid is \(324\).

Next, we consider the coordinates of points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\). Place \(D\) at \((0,0)\), \(C\) at \((650,0)\), \(A\) at \((75, 324)\), and \(B\) at \((575, 324)\) (since \(575 = 650 - 75\)).

The angle bisectors of \(\angle A\) and \(\angle D\) meet at point \(P\), and the angle bisectors of \(\angle B\) and \(\angle C\) meet at point \(Q\). Since the trapezoid is isosceles, points \(P\) and \(Q\) are symmetric with respect to the midpoint of the line segment joining the midpoints of \(AB\) and \(CD\). The distance between these midpoints is the same as the height of the trapezoid, which is \(324\).

Therefore, the length of \(PQ\) is equal to the height of the trapezoid, which is:
\[
\boxed{324}.
