 The problem: 
For any finite set $X$, let $| X |$ denote the number of elements in $X$. Define
\[S_n = \sum | A \cap B | ,\]
where the sum is taken over all ordered pairs $(A, B)$ such that $A$ and $B$ are subsets of $\left\{ 1 , 2 , 3,  \cdots , n \right\}$ with $|A| = |B|$.
For example, $S_2 = 4$ because the sum is taken over the pairs of subsets
\[(A, B) \in \left\{ (\emptyset, \emptyset) , ( \{1\} , \{1\} ), ( \{1\} , \{2\} ) , ( \{2\} , \{1\} ) , ( \{2\} , \{2\} ) , ( \{1 , 2\} , \{1 , 2\} ) \right\} ,\]
giving $S_2 = 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 2 = 4$.
Let $\frac{S_{2022}}{S_{2021}} = \frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find the remainder when $p + q$ is divided by
1000.


To find \( S_n \), we need to consider the sum of the sizes of the intersections of all pairs of subsets of \(\{1, 2, \ldots, n\}\) of the same size. Let's start by understanding the contribution of each element to the sum.

For a fixed element \( i \) in \(\{1, 2, \ldots, n\}\), we need to count how many times \( i \) appears in the intersection of two subsets \( A \) and \( B \) of the same size. If \( A \) and \( B \) both have \( k \) elements, then \( i \) can be in both \( A \) and \( B \) in \(\binom{n-1}{k-1}^2\) ways (since we choose \( k-1 \) elements from the remaining \( n-1 \) elements for both \( A \) and \( B \)).

The total number of pairs \((A, B)\) is \( 2^n \times 2^n = 4^n \). Since there are \(\binom{n}{k}\) subsets of size \( k \), the total contribution of element \( i \) to \( S_n \) is:
\[ \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k} \binom{n-1}{k-1}^2. \]
However, since \( \binom{n-1}{k-1} = 0 \) for \( k = 0 \) or \( k > n \), we can simplify this to:
\[ \sum_{k=1}^n \binom{n}{k} \binom{n-1}{k-1}^2. \]
Using the identity \( \binom{n}{k} = \binom{n}{n-k} \) and the fact that \( \binom{n-1}{k-1} = \binom{n-1}{n-k} \), we can rewrite the sum as:
\[ \sum_{k=1}^n \binom{n}{k} \binom{n-1}{k-1}^2 = \sum_{k=1}^n \binom{n}{k} \binom{n-1}{k-1} \binom{n-1}{k-1} = \sum_{k=1}^n \binom{n}{k} \binom{n-1}{k-1} \binom{n-1}{n-k}. \]
This is equivalent to the coefficient of \( x^{n-1} \) in the expansion of \( (1+x)^{2n-1} \), which is \( \binom{2n-1}{n-1} \).

Thus, the total contribution of all elements to \( S_n \) is \( n \binom{2n-1}{n-1} \). Therefore, we have:
\[ S_n = n \binom{2n-1}{n-1}. \]

Now, we need to find \( \frac{S_{2022}}{S_{2021}} \):
\[ S_{2022} = 2022 \binom{4043}{2021}, \]
\[ S_{2021} = 2021 \binom{4041}{2020}. \]
So,
\[ \frac{S_{2022}}{S_{2021}} = \frac{2022 \binom{4043}{2021}}{2021 \binom{4041}{2020}} = \frac{2022}{2021} \cdot \frac{4043! / (2021! \cdot 2022!)}{4041! / (2020! \cdot 2021!)} = \frac{2022}{2021} \cdot \frac{4043 \cdot 4042}{2022} = \frac{4043 \cdot 4042}{2021 \cdot 2022} = 2 \cdot 2 = 4. \]
Thus, \( \frac{S_{2022}}{S_{2021}} = \frac{4}{1} \), so \( p = 4 \) and \( q = 1 \). The remainder when \( p + q = 5 \) is divided by 1000 is:
\[ \boxed{5}. \]
