 The problem: 
For any finite set $X$, let $| X |$ denote the number of elements in $X$. Define
\[S_n = \sum | A \cap B | ,\]
where the sum is taken over all ordered pairs $(A, B)$ such that $A$ and $B$ are subsets of $\left\{ 1 , 2 , 3,  \cdots , n \right\}$ with $|A| = |B|$.
For example, $S_2 = 4$ because the sum is taken over the pairs of subsets
\[(A, B) \in \left\{ (\emptyset, \emptyset) , ( \{1\} , \{1\} ), ( \{1\} , \{2\} ) , ( \{2\} , \{1\} ) , ( \{2\} , \{2\} ) , ( \{1 , 2\} , \{1 , 2\} ) \right\} ,\]
giving $S_2 = 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 2 = 4$.
Let $\frac{S_{2022}}{S_{2021}} = \frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find the remainder when $p + q$ is divided by
1000.


To solve for \( S_n \), we need to consider the sum of the sizes of the intersections of all pairs of subsets of \(\{1, 2, \ldots, n\}\) with the same size. Let's denote the set as \( [n] = \{1, 2, \ldots, n\} \).

First, we calculate the number of subsets of \([n]\) of size \( k \), which is given by the binomial coefficient \(\binom{n}{k}\). For each subset \( A \) of size \( k \), there are \(\binom{n}{k}\) choices for \( A \), and for each choice of \( A \), there are \(\binom{n}{k}\) choices for \( B \). Therefore, there are \(\binom{n}{k}^2\) pairs \((A, B)\) such that \( |A| = |B| = k \).

Now, we need to find the contribution of each element \( i \in [n] \) to the sum \( S_n \). An element \( i \) will be in the intersection \( A \cap B \) if and only if both \( A \) and \( B \) contain \( i \). The number of ways to choose \( A \) and \( B \) such that \( i \in A \) and \( i \in B \) is the number of ways to choose the remaining \( k-1 \) elements from the remaining \( n-1 \) elements, which is \(\binom{n-1}{k-1}\). Since there are \(\binom{n}{k}^2\) pairs \((A, B)\), the total contribution of \( i \) to \( S_n \) is \(\binom{n-1}{k-1} \binom{n}{k}^2\).

Summing this over all possible \( k \) from 0 to \( n \), we get:
\[
S_n = \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n-1}{k-1} \binom{n}{k}^2.
\]
We can simplify this expression using the identity \(\binom{n}{k} = \binom{n}{n-k}\):
\[
S_n = \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n-1}{k-1} \binom{n}{k}^2 = \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n-1}{k-1} \binom{n}{k} \binom{n}{k} = \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n-1}{k-1} \binom{n}{k} \binom{n}{n-k}.
\]
Using the identity \(\binom{n}{k} = \binom{n}{n-k}\), we can rewrite the sum as:
\[
S_n = \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n-1}{k-1} \binom{n}{k} \binom{n}{k} = \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n-1}{k-1} \binom{n}{k} \binom{n}{n-k} = \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n-1}{k-1} \binom{n}{k} \binom{n}{k}.
\]
This sum can be simplified using the identity \(\sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n-1}{k-1} \binom{n}{k} \binom{n}{k} = \binom{2n-1}{n-1}^2\), so we have:
\[
S_n = \binom{2n-1}{n-1}^2.
\]

Now, we need to find \(\frac{S_{2022}}{S_{2021}}\):
\[
S_{2022} = \binom{4043}{2021}^2 \quad \text{and} \quad S_{2021} = \binom{4041}{2020}^2.
\]
Thus,
\[
\frac{S_{2022}}{S_{2021}} = \frac{\binom{4043}{2021}^2}{\binom{4041}{2020}^2} = \left( \frac{\binom{4043}{2021}}{\binom{4041}{2020}} \right)^2.
\]
Using the identity \(\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\), we get:
\[
\frac{\binom{4043}{2021}}{\binom{4041}{2020}} = \frac{\frac{4043!}{2021!2022!}}{\frac{4041!}{2020!2021!}} = \frac{4043 \cdot 4042}{2022 \cdot 2021} = \frac{4043 \cdot 2021}{2022 \cdot 1011} = \frac{4043}{2022}.
\]
Therefore,
\[
\frac{S_{2022}}{S_{2021}} = \left( \frac{4043}{2022} \right)^2 = \frac{4043^2}{2022^2}.
\]
Since 4043 and 2022 are relatively prime, the fraction is already in its simplest form. We need to find the remainder when \( p + q = 4043^2 + 2022^2 \) is divided by 1000. First, we calculate \( 4043^2 \mod 1000 \) and \( 2022^2 \mod 1000 \):
\[
4043 \equiv 43 \pmod{1000} \implies 4043^2 \equiv 43^2 = 1849 \equiv 849 \pmod{1000},
\]
\[
2022 \equiv 22 \pmod{1000} \implies 2022^2 \equiv 22^2 = 484 \pmod{1000}.
\]
Thus,
\[
4043^2 + 2022^2 \equiv 849 + 484 = 1333 \equiv 333 \pmod{1000}.
\]
The remainder when \( p + q \) is divided by 1000 is \(\boxed{333}\).
