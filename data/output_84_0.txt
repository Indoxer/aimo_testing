 The problem: 
Let $x,y$ and $z$ be positive real numbers that satisfy the following system of equations:
\[\log_2\left({x \over yz}\right) = {1 \over 2}\]\[\log_2\left({y \over xz}\right) = {1 \over 3}\]\[\log_2\left({z \over xy}\right) = {1 \over 4}\]
Then the value of $\left|\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\right|$ is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.


Alright, so I have this problem where I need to find the value of |log₂(x⁴y³z²)| given a system of logarithmic equations. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the problem gives me three equations with logarithms base 2:

1. log₂(x/(y z)) = 1/2
2. log₂(y/(x z)) = 1/3
3. log₂(z/(x y)) = 1/4

And then I need to compute |log₂(x⁴ y³ z²)| and express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Okay, so since all the equations are in terms of logs base 2, maybe I can rewrite each equation without the logarithms to make them easier to handle. Remember that if log_b(a) = c, then a = b^c. So applying that here:

1. x/(y z) = 2^(1/2)
2. y/(x z) = 2^(1/3)
3. z/(x y) = 2^(1/4)

Simplifying each of these equations:

1. x/(y z) = sqrt(2) => x = y z * sqrt(2)
2. y/(x z) = 2^(1/3) => y = x z * 2^(1/3)
3. z/(x y) = 2^(1/4) => z = x y * 2^(1/4)

Hmm, okay. Now, I have expressions for x, y, and z in terms of the other two variables. Maybe I can substitute these into each other to solve for one variable in terms of another or express everything in terms of a single variable.

Let me see. Starting with equation 1: x = y z sqrt(2). Let's substitute this expression for x into equation 2.

Equation 2: y = (x z) * 2^(1/3). Substituting x from equation 1:

y = ( (y z sqrt(2)) * z ) * 2^(1/3)
= y z² sqrt(2) * 2^(1/3)

So simplifying that:

y = y z² * 2^(1/2) * 2^(1/3) [since sqrt(2) is 2^(1/2)]
= y z² * 2^(5/6)

Wait, because 1/2 + 1/3 is 5/6, right? Yeah, because 3/6 + 2/6 is 5/6.

So now, we have:

y = y z² * 2^(5/6)

Hmm, assuming y ≠ 0, which it isn't because x, y, z are positive reals, so we can divide both sides by y:

1 = z² * 2^(5/6)

Therefore, solving for z²:

z² = 1 / 2^(5/6) = 2^(-5/6)

Taking square roots (and since z is positive):

z = 2^(-5/12)

Wait, hold on, because z squared is 2^(-5/6), so z is 2^(-5/12). Yes, because (-5/6)/2 = -5/12.

Got it, so z = 2^(-5/12). Alright, so that's z expressed in terms of base 2.

Now, let's use equation 3 to find an expression for z in terms of x and y, but perhaps it would help to also express y in terms of x and then substitute back?

Wait, equation 3 is z = x y * 2^(1/4). Since we already have z, maybe we can plug that expression for z into equation 3 after substituting z from above.

But before that, let's see if we can express y in terms of x or something else.

From equation 1: x = y z sqrt(2). We just found z, so plugging z into this:

x = y * 2^(-5/12) * sqrt(2)

sqrt(2) is 2^(1/2), so:

x = y * 2^(-5/12 + 1/2) = y * 2^(-5/12 + 6/12) = y * 2^(1/12)

Thus, x = y * 2^(1/12), meaning y = x * 2^(-1/12)

So now, we have y in terms of x: y = x * 2^(-1/12)

Now, let's go back to equation 2: y = x z * 2^(1/3). But we've already used that to get y in terms of x, so maybe moving on.

Alternatively, since we have z in terms of exponents, maybe let's plug z and y into equation 3 to solve for x.

Equation 3: z = x y * 2^(1/4)

We know z = 2^(-5/12), y = x * 2^(-1/12)

So substituting:

2^(-5/12) = x * (x * 2^(-1/12)) * 2^(1/4)
= x² * 2^(-1/12) * 2^(1/4)
= x² * 2^(-1/12 + 3/12)
= x² * 2^(2/12)
= x² * 2^(1/6)

Therefore,

2^(-5/12) = x² * 2^(1/6)

Let me write this as:

x² = 2^(-5/12) / 2^(1/6) = 2^(-5/12 - 2/12) = 2^(-7/12)

Therefore, x² = 2^(-7/12), so x = 2^(-7/24)

Because sqrt(2^(-7/12)) is 2^(-7/24).

So x = 2^(-7/24)

Now, since y = x * 2^(-1/12), then:

y = 2^(-7/24) * 2^(-1/12) = 2^(-7/24 - 2/24) = 2^(-9/24) = 2^(-3/8)

Similarly, z was already found as 2^(-5/12). Let me convert all exponents to have denominator 24 for ease of combining later:

x = 2^(-7/24)

y = 2^(-9/24) = 2^(-3/8)

z = 2^(-10/24) = 2^(-5/12)

Wait, actually, 5/12 is equivalent to 10/24, yeah.

So now, we have x, y, z in terms of powers of 2 with denominators 24.

So, let me note their exponents:

- x: exponent -7/24
- y: exponent -9/24
- z: exponent -10/24

So, if I were to express x^4 y^3 z^2, what would be the exponent of 2?

Well, log₂(x^4 y^3 z^2) would be equal to 4*log₂x + 3*log₂y + 2*log₂z

Which is 4*(-7/24) + 3*(-9/24) + 2*(-10/24)

Let me compute each term:

4*(-7/24) = -28/24

3*(-9/24) = -27/24

2*(-10/24) = -20/24

Adding them together:

-28/24 -27/24 -20/24 = (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24

Simplify that:

-75/24 can be reduced. Both numerator and denominator are divisible by 3:

-75 ÷ 3 = -25

24 ÷ 3 = 8

So, simplified, it's -25/8.

Therefore, log₂(x⁴ y³ z²) = -25/8

Since the problem asks for |log₂(x⁴ y³ z²)|, the absolute value is |-25/8| = 25/8.

So, m = 25, n = 8, which are coprime.

Therefore, m + n = 25 + 8 = 33.

Wait, hold on, let me double-check my calculations because fractions can be tricky.

Starting again:

x = 2^(-7/24)

y = 2^(-9/24)

z = 2^(-10/24)

Compute 4*log₂x = 4*(-7/24) = -28/24

3*log₂y = 3*(-9/24) = -27/24

2*log₂z = 2*(-10/24) = -20/24

Sum: -28 -27 -20 = -75 over 24, yes.

Divide numerator and denominator by GCD(75,24)=3: 75 ÷3=25, 24 ÷3=8, so indeed -25/8.

Absolute value is 25/8, so m=25, n=8, sum=33.

That seems solid.

But just to make sure I didn't make any mistake earlier when solving for x, y, z.

Let me recap:

From equation 1: x = y z * 2^(1/2)

From equation 2: y = x z * 2^(1/3)

Substituted x into equation 2: y = (y z * 2^(1/2)) * z * 2^(1/3) = y z² * 2^(5/6)

Divided both sides by y: 1 = z² * 2^(5/6) => z² = 2^(-5/6) => z = 2^(-5/12)

Then, from equation 1, x = y * 2^(-5/12) * 2^(1/2) = y * 2^(-5/12 + 6/12) = y * 2^(1/12) => y = x * 2^(-1/12)

From equation 3: z = x y * 2^(1/4)

Plugging z and y in terms of x: 2^(-5/12) = x * (x * 2^(-1/12)) * 2^(1/4) = x² * 2^(-1/12 + 3/12) = x² * 2^(2/12) = x² * 2^(1/6)

Thus, x² = 2^(-5/12) / 2^(1/6) = 2^(-5/12 - 2/12) = 2^(-7/12) => x = 2^(-7/24)

Then y = x * 2^(-1/12) = 2^(-7/24 - 2/24) = 2^(-9/24)

And z is 2^(-10/24) as above.

Yes, that looks consistent.

Therefore, calculating the logarithm:

log₂(x⁴ y³ z²) = 4*(-7/24) + 3*(-9/24) + 2*(-10/24) = (-28 -27 -20)/24 = -75/24 = -25/8

Taking absolute value: 25/8, which reduces to itself, so m=25, n=8, sum=33.

I think that's correct.

**Final Answer**
The value of \( m + n \) is \boxed{33}.
</think>

Given the system of equations involving logarithms base 2:

1. \(\log_2\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) = \frac{1}{2}\)
2. \(\log_2\left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) = \frac{1}{3}\)
3. \(\log_2\left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \frac{1}{4}\)

We rewrite each equation without the logarithms:

1. \(\frac{x}{yz} = 2^{1/2}\) implies \(x = yz \cdot 2^{1/2}\)
2. \(\frac{y}{xz} = 2^{1/3}\) implies \(y = xz \cdot 2^{1/3}\)
3. \(\frac{z}{xy} = 2^{1/4}\) implies \(z = xy \cdot 2^{1/4}\)

Substituting \(x = yz \cdot 2^{1/2}\) into the second equation:

\[ y = (yz \cdot 2^{1/2}) \cdot z \cdot 2^{1/3} \]
\[ y = yz^2 \cdot 2^{5/6} \]
Dividing both sides by \(y\):
\[ 1 = z^2 \cdot 2^{5/6} \]
\[ z^2 = 2^{-5/6} \]
\[ z = 2^{-5/12} \]

Using \(x = yz \cdot 2^{1/2}\) and substituting \(z\):
\[ x = y \cdot 2^{-5/12} \cdot 2^{1/2} \]
\[ x = y \cdot 2^{1/12} \]
\[ y = x \cdot 2^{-1/12} \]

Substituting \(y = x \cdot 2^{-1/12}\) and \(z = 2^{-5/12}\) into the third equation:
\[ 2^{-5/12} = x \cdot (x \cdot 2^{-1/12}) \cdot 2^{1/4} \]
\[ 2^{-5/12} = x^2 \cdot 2^{-1/12 + 3/12} \]
\[ 2^{-5/12} = x^2 \cdot 2^{1/6} \]
\[ x^2 = 2^{-5/12 - 2/12} \]
\[ x^2 = 2^{-7/12} \]
\[ x = 2^{-7/24} \]

Thus, we have:
- \(x = 2^{-7/24}\)
- \(y = 2^{-9/24}\)
- \(z = 2^{-10/24}\)

We need to find \(\left|\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2)\right|\):
\[ \log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) = 4 \log_2(x) + 3 \log_2(y) + 2 \log_2(z) \]
\[ = 4 \left(-\frac{7}{24}\right) + 3 \left(-\frac{9}{24}\right) + 2 \left(-\frac{10}{24}\right) \]
\[ = -\frac{28}{24} - \frac{27}{24} - \frac{20}{24} \]
\[ = -\frac{75}{24} \]
\[ = -\frac{25}{8} \]

Taking the absolute value:
\[ \left| -\frac{25}{8} \right| = \frac{25}{8} \]

Thus, \(m = 25\) and \(n = 8\), giving \(m + n = 33\).

\[
\boxed{33}
\]
