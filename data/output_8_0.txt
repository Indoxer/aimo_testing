 The problem: 
In isosceles trapezoid $ABCD$, parallel bases $\overline{AB}$ and $\overline{CD}$ have lengths $500$ and $650$, respectively, and $AD=BC=333$. The angle bisectors of $\angle{A}$ and $\angle{D}$ meet at $P$, and the angle bisectors of $\angle{B}$ and $\angle{C}$ meet at $Q$. Find $PQ$.


Alright, so I'm trying to solve this geometry problem about an isosceles trapezoid. Let me read it again to make sure I understand all the details.

We have an isosceles trapezoid \(ABCD\) with the bases \( \overline{AB} \) and \( \overline{CD} \). These bases are parallel, and their lengths are given as 500 and 650 units respectively. The legs \(AD\) and \(BC\) are both 333 units long. We need to find the distance between points \(P\) and \(Q\), where \(P\) is the intersection of the angle bisectors of angles \(A\) and \(D\), and \(Q\) is the intersection of the angle bisectors of angles \(B\) and \(C\).

First off, since it's an isosceles trapezoid, sides \(AD\) and \(BC\) are equal, which we already know (both 333). Also, in an isosceles trapezoid, the base angles are equal. That means angles \(A\) and \(B\) are equal, and angles \(C\) and \(D\) are equal. So, each pair of adjacent angles (at each base) are congruent.

Given that, let me try to visualize or sketch the trapezoid. Let me denote the vertices such that \(AB\) is the top base (500 units) and \(CD\) is the bottom base (650 units). So, points \(A\) and \(B\) are on the top, and \(C\) and \(D\) are on the bottom. Since it's isosceles, the legs \(AD\) and \(BC\) are symmetric with respect to the vertical axis of the trapezoid.

Let me consider the properties of angle bisectors in a trapezoid. In general, the angle bisectors can intersect at certain points inside the trapezoid. Here, we're dealing with two pairs of angle bisectors: those at \(A\) and \(D\), meeting at \(P\), and those at \(B\) and \(C\), meeting at \(Q\).

I remember that in some quadrilaterals, like parallelograms, the angle bisectors might intersect at specific points, but trapezoids are not parallelograms unless they are rectangles. So, we have a non-parallelogram trapezoid here.

Since \(AB\) and \(CD\) are parallel, maybe there are some similar triangles involved when considering the angle bisectors. Or perhaps properties related to the incenter or excenter? Hmm, wait, but trapezoids don't necessarily have an incenter unless they are tangential (i.e., having an incircle tangent to all four sides). Is this trapezoid tangential?

To check if it's tangential, the sum of the lengths of the two bases must be equal to the sum of the lengths of the two legs. Let's see:

Sum of the bases: \(AB + CD = 500 + 650 = 1150\)

Sum of the legs: \(AD + BC = 333 + 333 = 666\)

Since \(1150 \neq 666\), the trapezoid is not tangential, meaning it doesn't have an incenter. Therefore, the angle bisectors won't all meet at a single point. Instead, we have two different intersection points \(P\) and \(Q\), each from their respective pairs of angle bisectors.

So, how do we approach finding \(PQ\)? Maybe coordinate geometry could help here. Let me assign coordinates to the trapezoid to model it mathematically.

Let me place the trapezoid on a coordinate system such that the midpoint of \(AB\) is at the origin. Since it's isosceles, this should align the trapezoid symmetrically about the y-axis.

Let’s define the coordinates:

- Let the midpoint of \(AB\) be at (0, 0). Since \(AB = 500\), each half of \(AB\) will extend 250 units from the center. So, point \(A\) is at (-250, h) and point \(B\) is at (250, h), where \(h\) is the height of the trapezoid.

Similarly, the midpoint of \(CD\) will also lie along the y-axis because it's an isosceles trapezoid. Given that \(CD = 650\), each half of \(CD\) extends 325 units from the center. So, point \(D\) is at (-325, 0) and point \(C\) is at (325, 0).

Wait, hold on. Actually, in standard trapezoid orientation, the bases are horizontal, and the legs connect the endpoints. So, actually, if I place \(AB\) on the top, then \(A\) would be at (-250, k) and \(B\) at (250, k), while \(C\) is at (325, 0) and \(D\) at (-325, 0). But wait, that might not make sense because the distance from \(A\) to \(D\) is 333.

Alternatively, perhaps I should place the lower base \(CD\) on the x-axis for simplicity. So, let me adjust my coordinate system accordingly.

Let me set point \(D\) at (0, 0) and point \(C\) at (650, 0). Then, since the trapezoid is isosceles, points \(A\) and \(B\) will be located above \(D\) and \(C\) respectively, shifted horizontally by the same amount on both sides.

Since the top base \(AB\) has length 500, the distance between \(A\) and \(B\) is 500. To center \(AB\) over \(CD\), we need to shift each end inward by the same amount. The difference in the lengths of the bases is 650 - 500 = 150 units. Therefore, each side (left and right) will be indented by 75 units (since 150 divided by 2 is 75).

Therefore, point \(A\) is at (-75, h) and point \(B\) is at (650 + 75, h) = (725, h). Wait, no, that can’t be because then the distance from \(A\) to \(D\) would not be 333. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should place \(D\) at (-x, 0) and \(C\) at (x, 0), making the length \(CD = 2x = 650\), so \(x = 325\). Similarly, points \(A\) and \(B\) will be placed at (-y, h) and (y, h), with \(AB = 2y = 500\), so \(y = 250\).

Thus, the coordinates become:

- \(D = (-325, 0)\)
- \(C = (325, 0)\)
- \(A = (-250, h)\)
- \(B = (250, h)\)

Now, the legs \(AD\) and \(BC\) have length 333. So, the distance between \(A\) and \(D\) is sqrt[( -250 - (-325))^2 + (h - 0)^2] = sqrt[(75)^2 + h^2] = 333.

Similarly, the distance between \(B\) and \(C\) is the same, sqrt[(250 - 325)^2 + h^2] = sqrt[(-75)^2 + h^2] = 333. So, both distances are equal, which makes sense.

So, let's compute the height \(h\). From the equation:

sqrt(75^2 + h^2) = 333

So, 75^2 + h^2 = 333^2

Compute 75^2: 75*75 = 5625

Compute 333^2: 333*333. Let's compute that.

333 * 300 = 99,900

333 * 33 = 10,989

Total: 99,900 + 10,989 = 110,889

So, 5625 + h^2 = 110,889

Subtract 5625 from both sides:

h^2 = 110,889 - 5,625 = 105,264

Therefore, h = sqrt(105,264)

Let me compute sqrt(105,264):

Divide 105,264 by 144 to see if it's a perfect square.

105,264 ÷ 144 = 732. So, 144 * 732 = 105,264

Wait, but 144 * 700 = 100,800; 144*32=4,608; total 100,800 + 4,608 = 105,408, which is more than 105,264. Hmm, maybe another factor.

Wait, perhaps 105,264 divided by 16: 105,264 /16=6,579. Not helpful. Maybe 105,264 divided by 64: 105,264 /64=1,644. Still not obvious.

Perhaps compute sqrt(105,264): Let me note that 324^2 = 104,976 and 325^2=105,625. So sqrt(105,264) is between 324 and 325.

Compute 324.5^2: (324 + 0.5)^2 = 324^2 + 2*324*0.5 + 0.25 = 104,976 + 324 + 0.25 = 105,300.25

But 105,264 is less than that. So, 324.5^2=105,300.25 >105,264. So, try 324.4:

324.4^2 = ?

Let me compute 324^2 + 2*324*0.4 + 0.4^2 = 104,976 + 259.2 + 0.16 = 105,235.36

Which is still less than 105,264. Difference: 105,264 - 105,235.36 = 28.64

Now, per linear approximation, each additional 0.1 adds approximately 2*324*0.1 + 0.1^2=64.8 + 0.01=64.81 to the square.

Wait, no, derivative of x^2 is 2x, so near x=324.4, the slope is ~648.8. So, each 0.01 increase in x increases x^2 by approximately 64.88*0.01=0.6488.

We need to cover 28.64, so delta_x ≈ 28.64 / 648.8 ≈ 0.0441.

So, approximate sqrt(105,264) ≈ 324.4 + 0.0441 ≈ 324.4441.

But, maybe exact value isn't necessary yet. Alternatively, perhaps we can keep it symbolic for now. Let me just denote h = sqrt(105,264). Wait, 105,264 factors into... Let me see.

105,264 ÷ 16 = 6,579. So, 16*6,579=105,264

6,579 ÷ 3 = 2,193

2,193 ÷ 3 = 731

731 is prime? Let me check. 731 ÷ 17 = 43 (because 17*43=731). Yes, so 731=17*43.

Therefore, 105,264 = 16 * 3 * 3 * 17 * 43

So, h = sqrt(16 * 9 * 17 * 43) = 4 * 3 * sqrt(17 * 43) = 12 * sqrt(731)

But 731 is 17*43, which is prime factors. So, h=12*sqrt(731). Hmm, maybe that's useful later.

Anyway, moving on.

So, our trapezoid has coordinates:

- A: (-250, h)
- B: (250, h)
- C: (325, 0)
- D: (-325, 0)

Where h = 12*sqrt(731). Well, we might not need the exact decimal value; perhaps keeping it symbolic is better.

Now, we need to find the angle bisectors of angles A and D meeting at P, and angle bisectors of angles B and C meeting at Q.

Given the symmetry of the trapezoid, perhaps points P and Q lie along the vertical line of symmetry (the y-axis). That is, their x-coordinates are 0. If that's the case, then PQ is simply the difference in their y-coordinates.

Is this assumption correct? Let's think.

Since the trapezoid is symmetric about the y-axis, any construction based on angle bisectors should also respect this symmetry. That is, the angle bisector of angle A (which is at (-250, h)) should be mirrored by the angle bisector of angle B (at (250, h)). Similarly, angle bisectors of angles D and C should mirror each other across the y-axis.

Therefore, point P, being the intersection of angle bisectors of A and D, should lie somewhere along the y-axis. Similarly, point Q, being the intersection of angle bisectors of B and C, should also lie along the y-axis.

Hence, both P and Q are on the y-axis, so PQ is just the absolute difference between their y-coordinates.

Therefore, if I can find the y-coordinate of P and the y-coordinate of Q, subtracting them will give PQ.

But how do I find these y-coordinates? Hmm, perhaps using properties of angle bisectors in triangles or trapezoids.

Alternatively, maybe I can parametrize the angle bisectors and find their equations, then find their intersection points P and Q.

Let me consider angle bisectors at point A and point D first.

Starting with angle A. Point A is at (-250, h). The sides meeting at A are AD and AB.

Side AD goes from A (-250, h) to D (-325, 0). The vector for AD is (-325 - (-250), 0 - h) = (-75, -h).

Similarly, side AB goes from A (-250, h) to B (250, h). The vector for AB is (250 - (-250), 0) = (500, 0).

We can find the angle bisector at A by finding a direction vector that bisects the angle between vectors AD and AB.

To find the angle bisector, one method is to normalize the vectors and add them together. The resulting vector will point in the direction of the angle bisector.

So, let's compute unit vectors in the directions of AD and AB.

Vector AD: (-75, -h). Its magnitude is sqrt(75^2 + h^2) = 333, as given.

Vector AB: (500, 0). Its magnitude is 500.

So, unit vector of AD: (-75/333, -h/333)

Unit vector of AB: (500/500, 0/500) = (1, 0)

Adding these unit vectors gives the direction of the angle bisector:

(-75/333 + 1, -h/333 + 0) = ( ( -75 + 333 ) / 333, -h/333 ) = (258/333, -h/333 )

Simplify 258/333: Divide numerator and denominator by 3: 86/111. Further division by GCD(86,111)=1, so remains 86/111.

So, the direction vector of the angle bisector at A is (86/111, -h/333 ). We can write this as (86, -h/ (333/111)) = (86, -h/(3)) since 333 ÷ 111 = 3.

Wait, let me clarify:

If the direction vector is (258/333, -h/333), that simplifies to (258, -h) scaled by 1/333.

Alternatively, we can express the direction as (258, -h). For simplicity, we can use the direction vector (258, -h) without scaling.

Therefore, the angle bisector at A has direction (258, -h) and passes through point A (-250, h).

Similarly, the angle bisector at D: Let's analyze that.

Point D is at (-325, 0). The sides meeting at D are DA and DC.

Vector DA is from D to A: (-250 - (-325), h - 0) = (75, h)

Vector DC is from D to C: (325 - (-325), 0 - 0) = (650, 0)

Again, to find the angle bisector direction, we can take unit vectors of DA and DC and add them.

Magnitude of DA: sqrt(75^2 + h^2) = 333

Magnitude of DC: 650

Unit vector of DA: (75/333, h/333)

Unit vector of DC: (650/650, 0/650) = (1, 0)

Adding these unit vectors gives the direction of the angle bisector at D:

(75/333 + 1, h/333 + 0) = ( (75 + 333)/333, h/333 ) = (408/333, h/333 )

Simplify 408/333: Divide numerator and denominator by 3: 136/111. Which reduces further? 136 and 111 share a common divisor of... 136 ÷ 17 = 8, 111 ÷ 3 = 37. No common divisors, so 136/111.

Therefore, the direction vector is (136/111, h/333 ) which can be written as (136, 3h) scaled by 1/333.

Alternatively, we can use the direction vector (136, h) without scaling.

So, the angle bisector at D has direction vector (136, h) and passes through point D (-325, 0).

Now, we need to find the equations of these two angle bisectors and compute their intersection point P.

Equation of angle bisector at A:

Direction vector is (258, -h). Passes through (-250, h).

Parametric equations:

x = -250 + 258*t

y = h - h*t

Similarly, equation of angle bisector at D:

Direction vector is (136, h). Passes through (-325, 0).

Parametric equations:

x = -325 + 136*s

y = 0 + h*s

We need to find t and s such that:

-250 + 258*t = -325 + 136*s

and

h - h*t = h*s

Let me write down these equations:

1) 258t - 136s = -325 + 250 => 258t - 136s = -75

2) h(1 - t) = h*s => 1 - t = s (assuming h ≠ 0, which it is)

From equation 2: s = 1 - t

Plug into equation 1:

258t - 136*(1 - t) = -75

Expand:

258t - 136 + 136t = -75

Combine like terms:

(258t + 136t) - 136 = -75

394t - 136 = -75

394t = -75 + 136 = 61

Therefore, t = 61 / 394

Simplify: 61 and 394 have a GCD of 61? 394 ÷ 61 = 6.46... Hmm, 61*6=366, 394-366=28, so no. So, t = 61/394

Then s = 1 - t = 1 - 61/394 = (394 - 61)/394 = 333/394

So, now, substitute back into the parametric equations to get P's coordinates.

Using angle bisector from A:

x = -250 + 258*(61/394)

y = h - h*(61/394) = h*(1 - 61/394) = h*(333/394)

Calculate x:

Compute 258*(61/394):

First, simplify 258 and 394. 258 ÷ 2 = 129, 394 ÷ 2 = 197.

So, 129*(61)/197

Compute 129*61:

129*60 = 7,740

129*1 = 129

Total = 7,740 + 129 = 7,869

So, 7,869 / 197 ≈ let's compute that.

197*40 = 7,880. That's too much. 197*39 = 7,880 - 197 = 7,683

Difference: 7,869 - 7,683 = 186

So, 39 + (186/197) ≈ 39.934

So, x ≈ -250 + 39.934 ≈ -210.066

But let me keep it exact.

So, 7,869 / 197 = 39 + 186/197

So, x = -250 + 39 + 186/197 = (-250 + 39) + 186/197 = (-211) + 186/197 = -211 + 186/197

Similarly, y = h*(333/394)

So, point P is at ( -211 + 186/197 , h*(333/394) )

Hmm, that seems messy, but maybe we can work with fractions.

Alternatively, perhaps we can calculate the coordinates in terms of h, but ultimately, we need to find PQ, so maybe after computing P and Q, we can find the distance between them.

Alternatively, maybe instead of going through parametric equations, there's a better way using angle bisector theorem or properties.

Alternatively, since the trapezoid is symmetric, once we have point P, point Q should be symmetric across the y-axis, so its x-coordinate is the negative of P's x-coordinate, and y-coordinate remains the same? Wait, is that true?

Wait, no. Because P is the intersection of angle bisectors at A and D, which are both on the left side of the trapezoid. Similarly, Q is the intersection of angle bisectors at B and C, which are on the right side. Due to symmetry, though, their y-coordinates should be the same, and their x-coordinates should be negatives of each other.

Therefore, if P is at (p, q), then Q should be at (-p, q). Therefore, PQ would be the distance between (p, q) and (-p, q), which is 2|p|.

Therefore, if I can find the x-coordinate of P, then PQ is twice that.

Hence, maybe I just need to compute the x-coordinate of P, double it, and that's PQ.

So, let's focus on calculating the x-coordinate of P, which we found earlier as:

x = -211 + 186/197

Wait, let me compute that fraction correctly.

Earlier, we had:

x = -250 + 258*(61/394)

258*(61) = 15,738

15,738 / 394 = Let's divide 15,738 by 394.

394 * 40 = 15,760, which is 22 more than 15,738. So, 394*39 = 15,760 - 394 = 15,366

15,738 - 15,366 = 372

So, 394*39 + 372 = 15,366 + 372 = 15,738

372 / 394 = 186/197

So, 15,738 / 394 = 39 + 186/197

Therefore, x = -250 + 39 + 186/197 = (-250 + 39) + 186/197 = (-211) + 186/197

So, x = -211 + 186/197

Convert that to a single fraction:

-211 = -211*(197/197) = (-211*197)/197

Compute 211*197:

200*197 = 39,400

11*197 = 2,167

Total: 39,400 + 2,167 = 41,567

Thus, -211 = -41,567 / 197

Add 186/197:

x = (-41,567 + 186)/197 = (-41,381)/197

Wait, let's compute -41,567 + 186:

41,567 - 186 = 41,381 (since 41,567 - 100 = 41,467; 41,467 - 86 = 41,381)

Thus, x = -41,381 / 197

Compute 41,381 ÷ 197:

197*200 = 39,400

41,381 - 39,400 = 1,981

197*10 = 1,970

1,981 - 1,970 = 11

So, 41,381 = 197*210 + 11

Thus, 41,381 / 197 = 210 + 11/197

Therefore, x = -210 - 11/197

Wait, no: 41,381 / 197 = 210 + 11/197, so x = -(210 + 11/197) = -210 - 11/197

Wait, no, that can't be. Wait, original computation was:

x = -211 + 186/197 = (-211*197 + 186)/197 = (-41,387 + 186)/197 = (-41,201)/197

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculation earlier.

Wait, let's start over.

We had:

x = -250 + (258*61)/394

Compute 258*61:

258*60=15,480

258*1=258

Total=15,480 + 258=15,738

So, 15,738 / 394. Let's compute 394 divides into 15,738.

394*39=15,366

15,738 - 15,366=372

372 ÷ 394= 186/197

So, 15,738/394=39 + 186/197

Therefore, x= -250 + 39 + 186/197= (-250 +39)+186/197= (-211)+186/197

Expressed as a single fraction:

-211= (-211*197)/197= (-41,567)/197

Add 186/197: (-41,567 + 186)/197= (-41,381)/197

Now, compute 41,381 ÷197:

197*200=39,400

41,381 -39,400=1,981

197*10=1,970

1,981-1,970=11

Thus, 41,381=197*210 +11

Therefore, 41,381/197=210 +11/197

Hence, x= - (210 +11/197)= -210 -11/197

Wait, that seems extremely close to -210.5 or something, but let me confirm.

Wait, 41,381 divided by 197: 197*210=41,370. So, 41,381-41,370=11, so yes, 210 +11/197=210.056...

Therefore, x≈ -210.056

But maybe in fractional terms, x= -41,381/197

Similarly, y-coordinate of P is h*(333/394)

Recall h=12√731, so y=12√731*(333/394)

Simplify 333/394: Both divisible by... Let's check GCD(333,394). 333 divides by 3, 394 is even, so no. Thus, 333/394 is simplest.

So, y= (12*333/394)*√731

Compute 12*333=3,996

3,996 ÷394= let's compute:

394*10=3,940

3,996 -3,940=56

So, 394*10 +56=3,996

Thus, 3,996=394*10 +56

Therefore, 3,996/394=10 +56/394=10 +28/197

Thus, y= (10 +28/197)*√731=10√731 + (28√731)/197

So, point P is at (-41,381/197, 10√731 + (28√731)/197 )

Hmm, that seems complicated. Maybe I made a miscalculation earlier.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a smarter way to find the coordinates of P.

Wait, another thought: In a trapezoid, the intersection of angle bisectors can sometimes be found using the formula related to the inradius or something else, but since it's not a tangential trapezoid, it's tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps using trigonometry.

Given that, let's compute the angles at A and D.

In trapezoid ABCD, angle at A is between side AB and AD.

We can compute angle A using the cosine law in triangle ABD or something.

Wait, but triangle ABD: Points A, B, D.

Coordinates:

A: (-250, h)

B: (250, h)

D: (-325, 0)

So, sides:

AB: 500

AD: 333

BD: Distance between B (250, h) and D (-325, 0):

sqrt[ (250 +325)^2 + (h - 0)^2 ]=sqrt[575^2 + h^2]

Compute 575^2=330,625

So, BD= sqrt(330,625 + h^2 )

But h^2=105,264, so BD= sqrt(330,625 +105,264)=sqrt(435,889)

What's sqrt(435,889)?

Well, 660^2=435,600, so 660^2=435,600, 661^2=436,921. So, sqrt(435,889)= approx 660.29

But exact value is sqrt(435,889). Let me see if it's integer: 435,889 ÷ 13=33,529.923, not integer. Maybe 17: 435,889 ÷17≈25,640.529, nope. Maybe 19: 435,889 ÷19≈22,941.526, no. So, perhaps irrational. Maybe leave it as sqrt(435,889).

So, in triangle ABD, sides AB=500, AD=333, BD=sqrt(435,889). So, we can use the cosine law to find angle at A.

Law of cosines:

cos(angle A)= (AB² + AD² - BD²)/(2*AB*AD)

Plug in the values:

AB²=250,000

AD²=110,889

BD²=435,889

Thus,

cos(angle A)= (250,000 + 110,889 - 435,889)/(2*500*333)

Compute numerator:

250,000 +110,889=360,889

360,889 -435,889= -75,000

Denominator: 2*500*333=333,000

Thus, cos(angle A)= -75,000 / 333,000= -75/333= -25/111≈-0.2256

So, angle A≈ arccos(-0.2256)≈103 degrees approximately.

Similarly, angle D can be found in a similar fashion, but since it's a trapezoid, angle A + angle D=180 degrees.

Wait, in a trapezoid, consecutive angles between the bases are supplementary. So, angle A + angle D=180°, because sides AD and BC are the legs, and AB and CD are the bases.

Thus, angle D=180° - angle A≈77 degrees.

Therefore, the angle bisectors at A and D will split these angles into roughly 51.5° and 38.5°, respectively.

But perhaps we can find the exact measure.

But maybe instead of using angles, think about the angle bisector lengths or something else.

Alternatively, maybe using the formula for internal angle bisector length.

The formula for the length of the angle bisector in a triangle is known, but in this case, we're dealing with a trapezoid, so perhaps we need a different approach.

Wait, perhaps I can use coordinate geometry as I started earlier, but it seems too tedious.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps using vector methods.

Given that, let me re-examine the parametric equations.

Equation of angle bisector from A: x = -250 + 258*t, y = h - h*t

Equation of angle bisector from D: x = -325 + 136*s, y = 0 + h*s

Set them equal:

-250 + 258*t = -325 + 136*s --> Equation 1

h - h*t = h*s --> Equation 2

From Equation 2:

h(1 - t) = h*s

Assuming h ≠ 0, divide both sides by h:

1 - t = s --> s = 1 - t

Plug into Equation 1:

-250 + 258*t = -325 + 136*(1 - t)

Compute RHS:

-325 + 136 -136*t = (-325 + 136) -136*t = (-189) -136*t

So, Equation 1 becomes:

-250 +258*t = -189 -136*t

Bring all terms to left-hand side:

-250 +258*t +189 +136*t=0

Compute constants: -250 +189= -61

Variables:258*t +136*t=394*t

Thus: 394*t -61=0 --> 394*t=61 --> t=61/394

Which is what we found earlier.

So, t=61/394≈0.1546

Therefore, x= -250 +258*(61/394)= as before, x=-211 +186/197≈-210.056

Similarly, y= h*(1 - t)= h*(1 -61/394)= h*(333/394)

So, point P=(-211 +186/197, 333*h/394 )

Similarly, due to symmetry, point Q=(211 -186/197, 333*h/394 )

Therefore, PQ is the distance between (-211 +186/197, y) and (211 -186/197, y). Since the y-coordinates are the same, PQ is simply twice the absolute x-coordinate of P.

Hence, PQ=2*(211 -186/197 - (-211 +186/197 ))=Wait, no, more straightforwardly, distance between x_P and x_Q is |x_Q -x_P|= |(211 -186/197) - (-211 +186/197)|= |211 -186/197 +211 -186/197|= |422 - 372/197|

Compute 372/197=1.888...

So, 422 -1.888≈420.112

But let's do it exactly:

x_Q - x_P = (211 -186/197) - (-211 +186/197 )=211 -186/197 +211 -186/197=422 - (372)/197

Convert 422 to over 197:

422=422*197/197=83,134/197

372/197 remains as is.

Thus, x_Q -x_P=83,134/197 -372/197=82,762/197

Compute 82,762 ÷197:

197*420=197*400=78,800; 197*20=3,940; Total=78,800+3,940=82,740

Subtract:82,762 -82,740=22

Thus, 82,762=197*420 +22

Therefore, x_Q -x_P=420 +22/197

Thus, PQ=420 +22/197≈420.111...

But let me check again:

Wait, x_Q=211 -186/197

x_P= -211 +186/197

So, x_Q -x_P= [211 -186/197] - [ -211 +186/197 ]=211 -186/197 +211 -186/197=422 - (372)/197

Yes, which is 422 - 1.888...=420.112...

But in exact terms:

x_Q -x_P=422 -372/197= (422*197 -372)/197

Compute numerator:

422*197: Compute 400*197=78,800; 22*197=4,334; Total=78,800+4,334=83,134

Subtract 372:83,134 -372=82,762

Thus, x_Q -x_P=82,762/197=420 + (82,762 -420*197)/197

Compute 420*197: 400*197=78,800; 20*197=3,940; Total=78,800+3,940=82,740

Subtract:82,762 -82,740=22

Thus, x_Q -x_P=420 +22/197

So, PQ=420 +22/197

But the question asks for PQ, so 420 and 22/197 units. Since 22 and 197 have a GCD of 11? Wait, 197 is prime, so 22/197 cannot be simplified.

But 420 is 420, and 22/197≈0.1116

So, PQ≈420.1116

But wait, that seems like a lot, given the trapezoid has a difference in bases of 650, which is about 1.3 times the leg length. Hmm.

But wait, in reality, PQ is 420? But the trapezoid's midline is (500 +650)/2=575. So, 420 is less than that, which seems plausible.

But let me verify the calculation once again.

Wait, we found that x_Q -x_P=82,762/197=420 +22/197. Therefore, PQ=420 +22/197.

But the problem asks for PQ, and likely expects an exact value. So, 82,762/197.

But let me see if 82,762 is divisible by 197.

Compute 197*420=82,740, as above. 82,762 -82,740=22, so 82,762=197*420 +22, so 82,762/197=420 +22/197.

Thus, PQ=420 +22/197. However, since 22 and 197 are coprime, this is the exact value.

But 420 is a whole number, so the answer is 420 +22/197, but perhaps expressed as an improper fraction.

Wait, 420=420*197/197=82,740/197

Thus, 82,740/197 +22/197=82,762/197

Therefore, PQ=82,762/197

Simplify 82,762 ÷197.

Wait, 197*420=82,740

As above, 82,762 -82,740=22

So, 82,762=197*420 +22

Thus, 82,762/197=420 +22/197

So, it cannot be simplified further.

Therefore, PQ=420 +22/197=420.111...

But the problem says "Find PQ", and it's expecting a box around the answer. It may expect an exact fractional form, so 82,762/197.

But 82,762 divided by 197. Let me see if 82,762 and 197 have any common factors.

197 is a prime number, as 197 ÷ primes up to sqrt(197)~14. So, testing divisibility:

Does 197 divide 82,762? 197*420=82,740, remainder 22, as above. 22 <197, so no. Hence, 82,762/197 is reduced.

Alternatively, 82,762 divided by 2=41,381, 197 is odd, so no. So, 82,762/197 is the simplest.

But maybe 82,762/197 can be simplified as follows:

Compute GCD(82,762,197). Since 197 is prime, either GCD is 1 or 197.

Check if 197 divides 82,762: 197*420=82,740, 82,762-82,740=22, which is not divisible by 197, hence GCD is 1. So, 82,762/197 is simplest.

Therefore, PQ=82,762/197

But that's a huge fraction. Maybe we can divide numerator and denominator by something else? Wait, 82,762 ÷2=41,381; 197 ÷2=not integer. So, no.

Wait, 41,381 and 197: Check if 197 divides 41,381.

Compute 197*200=39,400

41,381 -39,400=1,981

197*10=1,970

1,981 -1,970=11

So, 41,381=197*210 +11

Thus, 41,381=197*210 +11, so 41,381/197=210 +11/197

Therefore, 82,762/197=2*(41,381)/197=2*(210 +11/197)=420 +22/197, same as before.

Thus, PQ=420 +22/197=420.111...

But 420 is a whole number, so perhaps 420.111... is acceptable, but the problem probably expects an exact value, so 420 +22/197, which is 82,762/197.

But let me cross-verify.

Wait, is 82,762 divided by 197 indeed equals 420 +22/197?

Yes, as 197*420=82,740, and 82,762-82,740=22.

Alternatively, perhaps we can represent 82,762/197 as a mixed number, which is 420 22/197, but the problem doesn't specify.

But looking back at the problem statement, it says "put your final answer within \boxed{}". So, likely, they want it as a fraction, 82,762/197.

But 82,762 divided by 197. Wait, 197*420=82,740. So, 82,762-82,740=22. So, 82,762/197=420 +22/197=420 22/197.

Alternatively, we can note that 22/197 is approximately 0.1116, so PQ≈420.1116.

But since the problem is likely expecting an exact value, 82,762/197 is the exact value.

But wait, 82,762 divided by 197, let me perform the division to see if it can be reduced.

Wait, 197*420=82,740, 82,762-82,740=22.

So, 82,762=197*420 +22. So, as above.

Alternatively, 22/197 is approximately 0.1116, but we need to see if 22 and 197 have any common factors, but 197 is prime, so no.

Therefore, 82,762/197 is the simplest form.

But let me check if 82,762 and 197 have any common factors. 197 is prime, so only 1 or 197.

82,762 ÷197=420.1116... So, not integer, hence GCD is 1.

Thus, 82,762/197 is the simplest.

But 82,762 is equal to 420*197 +22, as above.

Wait, but 82,762 ÷197=420 +22/197, which is 420.1116.

But 420 is 420/1, so 420.1116 is 420 +22/197.

Alternatively, 82,762/197=420.1116, but as an exact fraction, 82,762/197.

But 82,762 ÷197, let's see if we can divide numerator and denominator by something.

Wait, 82,762 ÷2=41,381

197 ÷2=98.5, not integer.

No, so 82,762/197 is the simplest.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects a simpler answer, but given the calculations, I think it's 420 22/197, or 82,762/197.

But wait, let me see if 82,762/197 can be expressed differently.

Wait, 82,762 ÷197=420.1116, but 420.1116 is approximately 420 +1/9, since 1/9≈0.1111. But 22/197≈0.1116, which is slightly larger than 1/9≈0.1111.

But 22/197 is approximately 0.1116, which is about 1/9. So, maybe the answer is approximately 420.111, but since it's exact, we need to write it as a fraction.

Therefore, my conclusion is that PQ=82,762/197.

But let me check if 82,762/197 can be simplified.

Wait, 82,762 ÷2=41,381

197 ÷2=98.5, not integer.

Thus, 82,762/197 is irreducible.

Therefore, PQ=82,762⁄197. But let me compute that:

197×420=82,740

82,762−82,740=22

Thus, 82,762⁄197=420+22⁄197=420 22⁄197

But in the box, I think we can write it as a fraction.

Alternatively, maybe I made a computational error earlier.

Wait, let me verify my initial steps.

We had point A at (-250, h), D at (-325, 0). Then, calculated angle bisectors, got their equations, solved for P, then found that PQ=420 +22/197≈420.111.

But thinking about the trapezoid, with AB=500, CD=650, the midline is (500+650)/2=575. So, the midline is 575 units long.

The midline connects midpoints of legs, which is from ((-250+250)/2, h/2)=(0,h/2) to ((-325-325)/2,0/2)=(-325,-0). Wait, no, midpoints are ((-250 +250)/2, (h + h)/2)=(0, h) and ((-325 + (-325))/2, (0 +0)/2)=(-325, 0). Wait, no.

Wait, midpoints of legs AD and BC.

Midpoint of AD: average of A(-250, h) and D(-325,0):

x: (-250 + (-325))/2=(-575)/2=-287.5

y: (h +0)/2=h/2

Similarly, midpoint of BC: B(250, h) and C(325,0):

x: (250 +325)/2=575/2=287.5

y: (h +0)/2=h/2

Thus, the midline is the segment connecting (-287.5, h/2) and (287.5, h/2), which has length 287.5 - (-287.5)=575, which matches the midline formula.

So, the midline is 575 units long.

Our result for PQ is 420.111..., which is less than 575, so it's plausible.

But let me think differently.

Given that P and Q lie on the angle bisectors, and due to the trapezoid's symmetry, their midpoint lies on the y-axis, and PQ is horizontal, so it's entirely determined by the x-coordinate.

Alternatively, maybe there's a property in trapezoids that relates the distance between the intersections of the angle bisectors to the midline or something else.

But since I couldn't recall any such property, and my coordinate approach led me to PQ=82,762⁄197≈420.111.

But 82,762 divided by 197 is exactly 420.11165...

Wait, 197×0.11165≈22, so yeah, 22⁄197≈0.11165.

So, 82,762⁄197 is equal to 420 +22⁄197.

But let me check my initial parametrization.

Wait, when I wrote the equations for the angle bisectors, I assumed direction vectors. But perhaps I made a mistake in the direction of the angle bisectors.

Wait, in particular, for the angle bisector at A, the direction vector was (258, -h). But perhaps the actual direction should be towards the interior of the trapezoid.

Wait, point A is at (-250, h). The angle bisector goes towards the interior of the trapezoid, which is towards the right and downward.

Wait, but according to our calculation, the parametric equations went from A(-250, h) towards increasing x and decreasing y, which is towards the interior.

Similarly, for the angle bisector at D, from D(-325, 0) towards increasing x and increasing y, which is towards the interior.

Therefore, the direction vectors seem correct.

Alternatively, maybe the issue is that in a trapezoid with unequal legs, the angle bisectors might not meet at points that are symmetric in a simple way.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the incenter-like points, but since the trapezoid isn't tangential, they aren't the same.

Alternatively, maybe using trigonometric identities.

Wait, perhaps using the fact that the angle bisectors create smaller triangles whose bases can be computed.

Wait, but that might complicate things.

Alternatively, maybe using vector projections.

Wait, since I've spent quite a bit of time on this, and my calculation leads me to PQ=82,762⁄197≈420.111, which is about 420.111.

But since the problem is from a competition, the answer is likely an integer or a nice fraction. 82,762⁄197 is approximately 420.111, but maybe it's exactly 420.1111..., which is 420 1/9, but 1/9≈0.1111.

But 22/197≈0.1116, which is slightly more than 1/9.

Alternatively, maybe I made a computational mistake earlier.

Wait, let me recast the problem.

Given that ABCD is an isosceles trapezoid with bases AB=500, CD=650, and legs AD=BC=333.

We can model this as a trapezoid with AB on top, CD at the bottom, centered at the origin.

The coordinates:

A: (-250, h)

B: (250, h)

C: (325, 0)

D: (-325, 0)

Height h=12√731≈12*27.048≈324.58

But perhaps h=12√731 is exact.

Then, the angle bisectors at A and D.

Wait, maybe instead of parametrizing, use the formula for internal angle bisector in terms of the sides.

In a triangle, the angle bisector length can be found by the formula:

If in triangle XYZ, angle bisector from X meets YZ at L, then XL=2XY*XZ*cos(theta/2)/(XY + XZ)

But in this case, it's a quadrilateral, so not directly applicable.

Alternatively, in triangle ABD, the angle bisector from A meets BD at some point.

But since ABCD is a trapezoid, not a triangle, so perhaps difficult.

Alternatively, maybe use coordinates.

Alternatively, let me consider projecting the angle bisectors onto the bases.

But this is getting too vague.

Alternatively, maybe recognizing that in a trapezoid, the distance between the feet of the angle bisectors can be found via harmonic mean or something.

But honestly, I think my coordinate approach is correct, albeit lengthy.

Thus, with that, I think the exact value is 82,762⁄197, which is approximately 420.111.

But 82,762 divided by 197 is exactly 420.11165...

But since the problem didn't specify whether to approximate or provide an exact value, and given the context, it's likely expecting an exact value.

Therefore, PQ=82,762⁄197, which is 420 22⁄197.

But let me check if 82,762 and 197 have any common factors.

As above, 197 is a prime number, so unless 197 divides 82,762, which it does not (as shown earlier), the fraction is reduced.

Therefore, the exact value is 82,762⁄197.

But 82,762 divided by 197 is 420 with a remainder of 22, so as a mixed number, it's 420 22⁄197.

But in boxed form, writing it as \boxed{\dfrac{82762}{197}} is acceptable, but maybe we can simplify.

Alternatively, since 82,762=197*420 +22, so 82,762=197*420 +22, so 82,762/197=420 +22/197.

But 22 and 197 are co-prime, so we can write it as 420 +22/197.

But in the problem statement, since they mention to put the answer in a box, likely as a common fraction, so \boxed{\dfrac{82762}{197}}.

But let me verify once more.

Wait, in the parametrization, I found that t=61/394 for point P, which gave x=-211 +186/197≈-210.056

Similarly, for point Q, t=1 -61/394=333/394, which gave x=211 -186/197≈210.056

Therefore, the distance between x= -210.056 and x=210.056 is 420.112, which is consistent with 82,762⁄197≈420.1116.

Thus, I think that is the correct answer.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{\dfrac{82762}{197}}
</think>

Given an isosceles trapezoid \(ABCD\) with bases \(\overline{AB}\) and \(\overline{CD}\) measuring 500 and 650 units respectively, and legs \(\overline{AD}\) and \(\overline{BC}\) each measuring 333 units. We need to find the distance \(PQ\) where \(P\) is the intersection of the angle bisectors of \(\angle A\) and \(\angle B\), and \(Q\) is the intersection of the angle bisectors of \(\angle B\) and \(\angle C\).

1. **Coordinate System Setup**:
   - Place the trapezoid on a coordinate system with the midpoint of \(AB\) at the origin.
   - Coordinates of vertices:
     - \(A = (-250, h)\)
     - \(B = (250, h)\)
     - \(C = (325, 0)\)
     - \(D = (-325, 0)\)
   - Calculate the height \(h\) using the Pythagorean theorem:
     \[
     h = 12\sqrt{731}
     \]

2. **Angle Bisectors**:
   - Calculate the direction vectors and equations of the angle bisectors at points \(A\) and \(D\).
   - Parametric equations for the angle bisectors:
     - From \(A\): \(x = -250 + 258t\), \(y = h - ht\)
     - From \(D\): \(x = -325 + 136s\), \(y = hs\)

3. **Intersection Points**:
   - Solve for the intersection \(P\) by setting the parametric equations equal:
     \[
     -250 + 258t = -325 + 136s
     \]
     \[
     h(1 - t) = hs
     \]
   - Solving these, we find \(t = \frac{61}{394}\) and \(s = \frac{333}{394}\).
   - Coordinates of \(P\) are approximately \((-210.056, 10\sqrt{731} + \frac{333}{394} \cdot 333)\).

4. **Symmetry and Distance**:
   - By symmetry, point \(Q\) is the reflection of \(P\) across the y-axis.
   - The x-coordinates of \(P\) and \(Q\) are \(-210.056\) and \(210.056\) respectively.
   - The distance \(PQ\) is the absolute difference of these x-coordinates, which is approximately \(420.111\).

5. **Exact Value Calculation**:
   - Convert the approximate value to an exact fraction:
     \[
     PQ = \frac{82762}{197}
     \]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\dfrac{82762}{197}}
\]
