 The problem: 
In isosceles trapezoid $ABCD$, parallel bases $\overline{AB}$ and $\overline{CD}$ have lengths $500$ and $650$, respectively, and $AD=BC=333$. The angle bisectors of $\angle{A}$ and $\angle{D}$ meet at $P$, and the angle bisectors of $\angle{B}$ and $\angle{C}$ meet at $Q$. Find $PQ$.


To solve for the length \(PQ\) in the given isosceles trapezoid \(ABCD\), we start by analyzing the geometry of the trapezoid. The bases are \(AB = 500\) and \(CD = 650\), and the non-parallel sides are \(AD = BC = 333\).

First, we drop perpendiculars from points \(A\) and \(B\) to line \(CD\), meeting \(CD\) at points \(E\) and \(F\) respectively. This creates two right triangles \(ADE\) and \(BCF\), and a rectangle \(ABFE\). Since \(AB = 500\) and \(CD = 650\), the length of \(EF\) is equal to \(AB = 500\). Therefore, the lengths of \(DE\) and \(CF\) are each \(\frac{650 - 500}{2} = 75\).

Now, we can use the Pythagorean theorem in triangle \(ADE\) to find the height \(h\) of the trapezoid:
\[
h = \sqrt{AD^2 - DE^2} = \sqrt{333^2 - 75^2} = \sqrt{110889 - 5625} = \sqrt{105264} = 324.
\]

Next, we need to find the coordinates of points \(P\) and \(Q\). Since \(P\) is the intersection of the angle bisectors of \(\angle A\) and \(\angle D\), and \(Q\) is the intersection of the angle bisectors of \(\angle B\) and \(\angle C\), both \(P\) and \(Q\) lie on the line that is the angle bisector of the trapezoid's angles. This line is parallel to the bases and is located at a distance from \(AB\) that is the average of the heights from \(A\) and \(D\) to \(CD\), which is \(\frac{324 + 324}{2} = 324\).

The distance between the lines \(AB\) and \(CD\) is \(324\), so the vertical distance from \(P\) to \(AB\) is \(324 - 162 = 162\) (since the angle bisectors divide the height equally). Therefore, the coordinates of \(P\) and \(Q\) are such that the horizontal distance between them is the same as the horizontal distance between the projections of \(P\) and \(Q\) on \(AB\), which is the same as the horizontal distance between the midpoints of \(AB\) and \(CD\).

The horizontal distance between the midpoints of \(AB\) and \(CD\) is \(\frac{650 - 500}{2} = 75\). Thus, the distance \(PQ\) is the same as the horizontal distance between the midpoints of \(AB\) and \(CD\), which is \(75\).

Therefore, the length of \(PQ\) is \(\boxed{375}\).
