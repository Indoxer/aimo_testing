 The problem: 
Three spheres with radii $11$, $13$, and $19$ are mutually externally tangent. A plane intersects the spheres in three congruent circles centered at $A$, $B$, and $C$, respectively, and the centers of the spheres all lie on the same side of this plane. Suppose that $AB^2 = 560$. Find $AC^2$.


To solve the problem, we start by understanding the geometric configuration of the spheres and the plane. Let's denote the centers of the three spheres as \(O_1\), \(O_2\), and \(O_3\) with radii \(11\), \(13\), and \(19\) respectively. The plane intersects these spheres in three congruent circles centered at points \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\) respectively.

Since the circles are congruent, the distances from the centers of the spheres to the plane are equal to the radii of the spheres minus the radius of the circle formed by the intersection. Let the distance from the center of each sphere to the plane be \(d\). Then the radius of each circle is given by:
\[ r_1 = \sqrt{11^2 - d^2} = \sqrt{121 - d^2}, \]
\[ r_2 = \sqrt{13^2 - d^2} = \sqrt{169 - d^2}, \]
\[ r_3 = \sqrt{19^2 - d^2} = \sqrt{361 - d^2}. \]

The distance between the centers of any two spheres is the sum of their radii because they are mutually externally tangent. Therefore, we have:
\[ O_1O_2 = 11 + 13 = 24, \]
\[ O_1O_3 = 11 + 19 = 30, \]
\[ O_2O_3 = 13 + 19 = 32. \]

The distance \(AB\) is the distance between the centers of the circles formed by the intersection of the plane with the spheres, which is the same as the distance between the centers of the spheres minus twice the distance from the center of each sphere to the plane. Thus, we have:
\[ AB = \sqrt{(121 - d^2) + (169 - d^2)} - 2d = \sqrt{290 - 2d^2} - 2d. \]
We are given that \(AB^2 = 560\), so:
\[ (\sqrt{290 - 2d^2} - 2d)^2 = 560. \]
Expanding and simplifying, we get:
\[ 290 - 2d^2 + 4d\sqrt{290 - 2d^2} - 4d^2 = 560, \]
\[ 4d\sqrt{290 - 2d^2} = 270 + 6d^2, \]
\[ 2d\sqrt{290 - 2d^2} = 135 + 3d^2. \]
Squaring both sides, we obtain:
\[ 4d^2(290 - 2d^2) = (135 + 3d^2)^2, \]
\[ 1160d^2 - 8d^4 = 18225 + 810d^2 + 9d^4, \]
\[ 17d^4 - 350d^2 + 18225 = 0. \]
Let \(x = d^2\), then we have:
\[ 17x^2 - 350x + 18225 = 0. \]
Using the quadratic formula \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), we get:
\[ x = \frac{350 \pm \sqrt{350^2 - 4 \cdot 17 \cdot 18225}}{2 \cdot 17} = \frac{350 \pm \sqrt{122500 - 122500}}{34} = \frac{350}{34} = \frac{175}{17}. \]
Thus, \(d^2 = \frac{175}{17}\).

Now, we need to find \(AC^2\):
\[ AC = \sqrt{(121 - d^2) + (361 - d^2)} - 2d = \sqrt{482 - 2d^2} - 2d = \sqrt{482 - 2 \cdot \frac{175}{17}} - 2 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{175}}{\sqrt{17}} = \sqrt{482 - \frac{350}{17}} - \frac{2\sqrt{175}}{17} = \sqrt{\frac{8194 - 350}{17}} - \frac{2\sqrt{175}}{17} = \sqrt{\frac{7844}{17}} - \frac{2\sqrt{175}}{17} = \frac{2\sqrt{1961}}{17} - \frac{2\sqrt{175}}{17} = \frac{2(\sqrt{1961} - \sqrt{175})}{17}. \]
Then,
\[ AC^2 = \left( \frac{2(\sqrt{1961} - \sqrt{175})}{17} \right)^2 = \frac{4(1961 + 175 - 2\sqrt{1961 \cdot 175})}{289} = \frac{4(2136 - 2\sqrt{343175})}{289} = \frac{8544 - 8\sqrt{343175}}{289} = 400. \]
Thus, the value of \(AC^2\) is \(\boxed{640}\).
