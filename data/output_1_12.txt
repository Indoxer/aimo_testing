 The problem: 
Three spheres with radii $11$, $13$, and $19$ are mutually externally tangent. A plane intersects the spheres in three congruent circles centered at $A$, $B$, and $C$, respectively, and the centers of the spheres all lie on the same side of this plane. Suppose that $AB^2 = 560$. Find $AC^2$.


To solve the problem, we start by considering the geometry of the situation. Let the centers of the three spheres be \(O_1\), \(O_2\), and \(O_3\) with radii 11, 13, and 19, respectively. The distance between any two centers is the sum of their radii because the spheres are mutually externally tangent. Therefore, we have:
\[ O_1O_2 = 11 + 13 = 24, \]
\[ O_2O_3 = 13 + 19 = 32, \]
\[ O_3O_1 = 19 + 11 = 30. \]

The plane intersects the spheres in three congruent circles centered at points \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\) on the respective spheres. Since the circles are congruent, the distances from the centers of the spheres to the plane are proportional to the radii of the spheres minus the radius of the circle. Let the distance from \(O_1\) to the plane be \(d_1\), from \(O_2\) to the plane be \(d_2\), and from \(O_3\) to the plane be \(d_3\). Then we have:
\[ d_1 = r_1 - r_A = 11 - r_A, \]
\[ d_2 = r_2 - r_B = 13 - r_B, \]
\[ d_3 = r_3 - r_C = 19 - r_C, \]
where \(r_A\), \(r_B\), and \(r_C\) are the radii of the circles formed by the intersection of the plane with the spheres.

Since the circles are congruent, we have \(r_A = r_B = r_C = r\). Therefore, the distances from the centers of the spheres to the plane are:
\[ d_1 = 11 - r, \]
\[ d_2 = 13 - r, \]
\[ d_3 = 19 - r. \]

The distance between any two points \(A\) and \(B\) on the circles is given by the Pythagorean theorem in the plane perpendicular to the line connecting the centers of the spheres and passing through the points \(A\) and \(B\). Specifically, we have:
\[ AB^2 = (O_1O_2)^2 - (d_1 - d_2)^2. \]
Substituting the known values, we get:
\[ 560 = 24^2 - (11 - r - (13 - r))^2, \]
\[ 560 = 576 - (-2)^2, \]
\[ 560 = 576 - 4, \]
\[ 560 = 572 - 4r, \]
\[ 4r = 12, \]
\[ r = 3. \]

Now, we need to find \(AC^2\). Using the same formula, we have:
\[ AC^2 = (O_1O_3)^2 - (d_1 - d_3)^2. \]
Substituting the known values, we get:
\[ AC^2 = 30^2 - (11 - r - (19 - r))^2, \]
\[ AC^2 = 900 - (-8)^2, \]
\[ AC^2 = 900 - 64, \]
\[ AC^2 = 836. \]

Therefore, the value of \(AC^2\) is \(\boxed{836}\).
