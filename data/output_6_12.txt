 The problem: 
Let $x,$ $y,$ and $z$ be positive real numbers satisfying the system of equations:
\begin{align*} \sqrt{2x-xy} + \sqrt{2y-xy} &= 1 \\ \sqrt{2y-yz} + \sqrt{2z-yz} &= \sqrt2 \\ \sqrt{2z-zx} + \sqrt{2x-zx} &= \sqrt3. \end{align*} 
Then $\left[ (1-x)(1-y)(1-z) \right]^2$ can be written as $\frac{m}{n},$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n.$


To solve the given system of equations, we start by analyzing each equation individually and looking for possible values of \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\).

The first equation is:
\[
\sqrt{2x - xy} + \sqrt{2y - xy} = 1.
\]
Let's assume \(x = y\). Then the equation simplifies to:
\[
2\sqrt{2x - x^2} = 1 \implies \sqrt{2x - x^2} = \frac{1}{2} \implies 2x - x^2 = \frac{1}{4} \implies 8x - 4x^2 = 1 \implies 4x^2 - 8x + 1 = 0.
\]
Solving this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), we get:
\[
x = \frac{8 \pm \sqrt{64 - 16}}{8} = \frac{8 \pm \sqrt{48}}{8} = \frac{8 \pm 4\sqrt{3}}{8} = \frac{2 \pm \sqrt{3}}{2}.
\]
Since \(x\) and \(y\) are positive real numbers, we have two possible solutions for \(x\) and \(y\): \(x = y = \frac{2 + \sqrt{3}}{2}\) or \(x = y = \frac{2 - \sqrt{3}}{2}\).

Next, we check the second equation:
\[
\sqrt{2y - yz} + \sqrt{2z - yz} = \sqrt{2}.
\]
Assuming \(y = z\), the equation simplifies to:
\[
2\sqrt{2y - y^2} = \sqrt{2} \implies \sqrt{2y - y^2} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \implies 2y - y^2 = \frac{1}{2} \implies 4y - 2y^2 = 1 \implies 2y^2 - 4y + 1 = 0.
\]
Solving this quadratic equation, we get:
\[
y = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{16 - 8}}{4} = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{8}}{4} = \frac{4 \pm 2\sqrt{2}}{4} = \frac{2 \pm \sqrt{2}}{2}.
\]
So, \(y = z = \frac{2 + \sqrt{2}}{2}\) or \(y = z = \frac{2 - \sqrt{2}}{2}\).

Finally, we check the third equation:
\[
\sqrt{2z - zx} + \sqrt{2x - zx} = \sqrt{3}.
\]
Assuming \(z = x\), the equation simplifies to:
\[
2\sqrt{2z - z^2} = \sqrt{3} \implies \sqrt{2z - z^2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \implies 2z - z^2 = \frac{3}{4} \implies 8z - 4z^2 = 3 \implies 4z^2 - 8z + 3 = 0.
\]
Solving this quadratic equation, we get:
\[
z = \frac{8 \pm \sqrt{64 - 48}}{8} = \frac{8 \pm \sqrt{16}}{8} = \frac{8 \pm 4}{8} = \frac{2 \pm 1}{2}.
\]
So, \(z = x = \frac{3}{2}\) or \(z = x = \frac{1}{2}\).

By comparing the possible values, we find that the consistent solution is \(x = y = z = \frac{2 - \sqrt{3}}{2}\). Now, we need to find \((1-x)^2(1-y)^2(1-z)^2\):
\[
1 - x = 1 - \frac{2 - \sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{2 - (2 - \sqrt{3})}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.
\]
Thus,
\[
(1-x)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{4}.
\]
Therefore,
\[
(1-x)^2(1-y)^2(1-z)^2 = \left(\frac{3}{4}\right)^3 = \frac{27}{64}.
\]
So, \(\left[(1-x)(1-y)(1-z)\right]^2 = \frac{27}{64}\), and the sum of the numerator and the denominator is:
\[
27 + 64 = 91.
\]
The answer is:
\[
\boxed{91}.
\]
