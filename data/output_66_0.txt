 The problem: 
Let $\mathcal{B}$ be the set of rectangular boxes with surface area $54$ and volume $23$. Let $r$ be the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of $\mathcal{B}$. The value of $r^2$ can be written as $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$.


Okay, so I have this problem about finding the smallest sphere that can contain all rectangular boxes with a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. Then I need to find r squared, express it as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime, and then find p + q. Hmm, okay.

First, let me parse the problem. We have a set B of rectangular boxes (so each box has length, width, height) with two constraints: their surface area is 54, and their volume is 23. Then, among all these boxes, we need to find the minimal sphere that can contain each of them. So the sphere's radius r must be such that every box in B fits inside the sphere. Then, we need to find the square of that radius, simplify it to a reduced fraction, and add numerator and denominator.

Alright, so my goal is to find the minimal r such that for any box with surface area 54 and volume 23, the box can fit inside a sphere of radius r. Therefore, I need to find the maximum possible distance from the center of the box to any of its vertices, which would be the radius of the sphere needed. Since all boxes must fit inside the sphere, the largest such distance across all boxes in B will be our r.

So, the key idea here is that for each box, the space diagonal (the longest diagonal inside the box) will determine the minimal enclosing sphere for that box. The space diagonal d of a box with sides a, b, c is given by:

d = sqrt(a² + b² + c²)

Therefore, the radius r of the sphere containing the box is half of the space diagonal:

r = d/2 = (sqrt(a² + b² + c²))/2

Thus, r² = (a² + b² + c²)/4

So, if I can find the maximum value of a² + b² + c² for all boxes with surface area 54 and volume 23, then dividing that maximum by 4 will give me r².

Hence, my problem reduces to maximizing a² + b² + c² subject to the constraints:

1. Surface area: 2(ab + bc + ac) = 54
2. Volume: abc = 23

And then compute (maximum value)/4, which will be r².

Now, how do I maximize a² + b² + c² given these constraints? This seems like an optimization problem with constraints. I think using Lagrange multipliers might be the way to go here because we have multiple variables and constraints.

Let me recall that in calculus, to maximize or minimize a function subject to equality constraints, we use Lagrange multipliers. So, let's define f(a,b,c) = a² + b² + c², which we want to maximize.

The constraints are:
g(a,b,c) = 2(ab + bc + ac) - 54 = 0
h(a,b,c) = abc - 23 = 0

So, we'll set up the Lagrangian with two constraints, meaning two multipliers. The Lagrangian L is:

L(a,b,c,λ,μ) = a² + b² + c² - λ(2ab + 2bc + 2ac - 54) - μ(abc - 23)

Wait, actually, no. Wait, the standard form is L = f - λ(g - c1) - μ(h - c2). So, yes, correct.

So, L = a² + b² + c² - λ(2ab + 2bc + 2ac - 54) - μ(abc - 23)

Then, to find extrema, take partial derivatives with respect to a, b, c, λ, μ and set them equal to zero.

Compute ∂L/∂a = 2a - λ(2b + 2c) - μ(bc) = 0
Similarly, ∂L/∂b = 2b - λ(2a + 2c) - μ(ac) = 0
∂L/∂c = 2c - λ(2a + 2b) - μ(ab) = 0
∂L/∂λ = -(2ab + 2bc + 2ac - 54) = 0 => 2ab + 2bc + 2ac = 54
∂L/∂μ = -(abc - 23) = 0 => abc = 23

So, now we have five equations:

1. 2a - 2λ(b + c) - μ bc = 0
2. 2b - 2λ(a + c) - μ ac = 0
3. 2c - 2λ(a + b) - μ ab = 0
4. 2ab + 2bc + 2ac = 54
5. abc = 23

This seems quite involved, but maybe we can find some symmetry or ratio between a, b, c.

Looking at equations 1, 2, 3, they seem symmetric. Perhaps assuming that a = b = c? But wait, if a = b = c, then the box is a cube. Let's check if that satisfies the surface area and volume.

If a = b = c, then surface area would be 6a² = 54 => a² = 9 => a = 3. Then, volume would be a³ = 27. But our volume is 23, not 27, so it's not a cube. Hence, a ≠ b ≠ c.

Hmm. So, perhaps two variables are equal? Let me suppose that a = b ≠ c. Maybe that simplifies things.

Let’s try setting a = b. Then, our equations become:

From equation 1 and 2: since a = b, equations 1 and 2 should be the same. Let's see:

Equation 1: 2a - 2λ(a + c) - μ ac = 0
Equation 2: 2a - 2λ(a + c) - μ ac = 0 (same as equation 1)
Equation 3: 2c - 2λ(2a) - μ a² = 0

So, equations 1 and 2 give us the same information, while equation 3 is different.

Let me write down the modified equations when a = b:

1. 2a - 2λ(a + c) - μ ac = 0
3. 2c - 4λ a - μ a² = 0

Also, constraints become:

4. 2(a² + 2ac) = 54 => 2a² + 4ac = 54 => a² + 2ac = 27
5. a² c = 23

So, we have a system of three equations:

i. 2a - 2λ(a + c) - μ ac = 0
ii. 2c - 4λ a - μ a² = 0
iii. a² + 2ac = 27
iv. a² c = 23

Wait, actually, equations iii and iv are from the constraints, and equations i and ii come from the partial derivatives.

So, let me solve equations iii and iv first to find a relationship between a and c.

From equation iv: a² c = 23 => c = 23 / a²

Substitute into equation iii: a² + 2a*(23 / a²) = 27

Simplify:

a² + (46 / a) = 27

Multiply both sides by a to eliminate denominator:

a³ + 46 = 27a

Bring all terms to left-hand side:

a³ - 27a + 46 = 0

So, now, we need to solve cubic equation a³ - 27a + 46 = 0.

Hmm, solving cubics can be tricky, but maybe there is an integer root. Let's test possible integer roots using Rational Root Theorem. Possible roots are factors of 46 over factors of 1, so ±1, ±2, ±23, ±46.

Testing a=1: 1 - 27 + 46 = 20 ≠ 0

a=2: 8 - 54 + 46 = 0 → Yes! a=2 is a root.

So, factor the cubic as (a - 2)(quadratic) = a³ - 27a + 46.

Using polynomial division or synthetic division:

Divide a³ - 27a + 46 by (a - 2).

Set up synthetic division:

2 | 1  0  -27  46
       2   4  -46
     1  2  -23  0

So, the quadratic factor is a² + 2a - 23.

Thus, a³ - 27a + 46 = (a - 2)(a² + 2a - 23)

Set equal to zero: (a - 2)(a² + 2a - 23) = 0

So, solutions are a = 2, and roots of a² + 2a - 23 = 0.

Solve a² + 2a - 23 = 0:

Discriminant D = 4 + 92 = 96

Roots: (-2 ± sqrt(96))/2 = (-2 ± 4*sqrt(6))/2 = -1 ± 2*sqrt(6)

Since a represents length, it must be positive. So, a = 2 or a = -1 + 2√6 ≈ -1 + 4.898 ≈ 3.898

But let's keep it exact: a = 2 or a = -1 + 2√6

So, a could be 2 or -1 + 2√6.

Let me note that a must satisfy c = 23/a² > 0, so both options are acceptable.

First, consider a = 2:

Then, c = 23/(2)^2 = 23/4 = 5.75

So, a = b = 2, c = 23/4

Alternatively, a = -1 + 2√6 ≈ 3.898

Compute c in that case: c = 23 / a² = 23 / ( (-1 + 2√6)^2 )

Compute denominator:

(-1 + 2√6)^2 = 1 - 4√6 + 24 = 25 - 4√6

Hence, c = 23 / (25 - 4√6)

Rationalize denominator:

Multiply numerator and denominator by (25 + 4√6):

c = 23*(25 + 4√6) / [ (25)^2 - (4√6)^2 ] = 23*(25 + 4√6)/(625 - 16*6) = 23*(25 + 4√6)/(625 - 96) = 23*(25 + 4√6)/529

Simplify:

23 cancels with 529, since 529 = 23². Thus,

c = (25 + 4√6)/23

So, c ≈ (25 + 4*2.449)/23 ≈ (25 + 9.796)/23 ≈ 34.796/23 ≈ 1.513

So, for a = -1 + 2√6 ≈ 3.898, c ≈ 1.513

So, we have two possibilities for a and c when a = b.

Now, going back to equations i and ii.

From equation i: 2a - 2λ(a + c) - μ ac = 0

From equation ii: 2c - 4λ a - μ a² = 0

We can treat these as two equations in variables λ and μ.

Let me denote equation i as:

2a - 2λ(a + c) - μ ac = 0 --> 2a = 2λ(a + c) + μ ac

Equation ii as:

2c - 4λ a - μ a² = 0 --> 2c = 4λ a + μ a²

So, let me write these as:

Equation i: 2λ(a + c) + μ ac = 2a

Equation ii: 4λ a + μ a² = 2c

We can write this as a linear system in λ and μ:

[ 2(a + c)      a c ] [λ]   = [2a]
[ 4 a          a² ] [μ]     [2c]

Let me denote matrix M:

M = [ 2(a + c)      a c ]
    [   4 a         a² ]

And vector v = [2a; 2c]

So, M * [λ; μ] = v

We can solve for λ and μ using Cramer's Rule or substitution.

Let me compute determinant of M:

det(M) = 2(a + c)*a² - 4a*(a c) = 2a²(a + c) - 4a² c = 2a³ + 2a² c - 4a² c = 2a³ - 2a² c

Factor out 2a²: det(M) = 2a²(a - c)

Assuming a ≠ c, which is true in both cases since a = 2 and c = 23/4 ≈5.75, so a ≠ c, and in the other case, a ≈3.898, c≈1.513, so again a≠c. So determinant is non-zero, hence invertible.

Therefore, solution exists:

[λ; μ] = inv(M) * v

But computing inverse might be tedious. Alternatively, solve via substitution.

From equation ii: 4λ a + μ a² = 2c --> μ a² = 2c - 4λ a --> μ = (2c - 4λ a)/a²

Plug into equation i:

2λ(a + c) + [(2c - 4λ a)/a²]* a c = 2a

Simplify:

2λ(a + c) + (2c - 4λ a)*(c)/a = 2a

Expand:

2λ(a + c) + (2c²/a - 4λ c) = 2a

Combine like terms:

[2λ(a + c) - 4λ c] + 2c²/a = 2a

Simplify the lambda terms:

2λ a + 2λ c - 4λ c = 2λ a - 2λ c

Thus, overall:

2λ(a - c) + 2c²/a = 2a

Divide both sides by 2:

λ(a - c) + c²/a = a

Solve for λ:

λ(a - c) = a - c²/a

Hence,

λ = [a - c²/a] / (a - c) = [ (a² - c²)/a ] / (a - c ) = [ (a - c)(a + c)/a ] / (a - c ) = (a + c)/a

So, λ = (a + c)/a

Then, plug back into μ = (2c - 4λ a)/a²:

μ = (2c - 4*(a + c)/a * a)/a² = (2c - 4(a + c))/a² = (2c - 4a - 4c)/a² = (-4a - 2c)/a²

Simplify:

μ = -2(2a + c)/a²

So, now, with λ and μ expressed in terms of a and c, which we already have in terms of a.

So, for both cases when a = 2 and a = -1 + 2√6, we can compute λ and μ, but perhaps it's not necessary unless needed.

However, our main goal was to find the maximum of a² + b² + c², which in the case when a = b, becomes 2a² + c².

So, let's compute 2a² + c² for both scenarios.

Case 1: a = 2, c = 23/4

Compute 2*(2)^2 + (23/4)^2 = 2*4 + (529/16) = 8 + 33.0625 = 41.0625 = 657/16

Case 2: a = -1 + 2√6, c = (25 + 4√6)/23

Compute 2a² + c²

First, compute a = -1 + 2√6

Compute a²: (-1 + 2√6)^2 = 1 - 4√6 + 24 = 25 - 4√6

So, 2a² = 2*(25 - 4√6) = 50 - 8√6

Compute c²: [(25 + 4√6)/23]^2 = (625 + 200√6 + 96)/529 = (721 + 200√6)/529

Thus, 2a² + c² = (50 - 8√6) + (721 + 200√6)/529

Convert 50 - 8√6 to over 529:

50 = 50*529/529 = 26450/529

-8√6 = -8√6*529/529 = (-4232√6)/529

Thus, 2a² + c² = (26450/529) + (-4232√6)/529 + (721 + 200√6)/529

Combine numerators:

26450 + 721 + (-4232√6 + 200√6) = 27171 - 4032√6

Thus, total is (27171 - 4032√6)/529

Hmm, that seems messy. Is this larger than 657/16?

Wait, 657/16 is approximately 41.0625, as before.

Compute (27171 - 4032√6)/529:

First, approximate √6 ≈ 2.449

Compute numerator:

27171 - 4032*2.449 ≈ 27171 - 4032*2.449

Compute 4032*2.449:

Approximate 4032*2 = 8064

4032*0.449 ≈ 4032*0.4 = 1612.8; 4032*0.049 ≈ ~197.57

Total ≈ 1612.8 + 197.57 ≈ 1810.37

Thus, numerator ≈ 27171 - 1810.37 ≈ 25360.63

Divide by 529: 25360.63 / 529 ≈ 47.84

Which is higher than 41.0625, so this case gives a higher value.

Therefore, the maximum a² + b² + c² occurs when a = -1 + 2√6, b = a, c = (25 + 4√6)/23.

Thus, the maximum value is (27171 - 4032√6)/529

But hold on, that's a bit unwieldy. Maybe I made a mistake in calculation earlier.

Wait, let me double-check.

When a = -1 + 2√6, then a² = 25 - 4√6, right?

Yes, (-1 + 2√6)^2 = 1 - 4√6 + 24 = 25 - 4√6.

So, 2a² = 50 - 8√6.

Then c = (25 + 4√6)/23, so c² = (25 + 4√6)^2 / (23)^2

Compute numerator: (25)^2 + 2*25*4√6 + (4√6)^2 = 625 + 200√6 + 96 = 721 + 200√6

Thus, c² = (721 + 200√6)/529

So, 2a² + c² = (50 - 8√6) + (721 + 200√6)/529

Expressed over 529:

50 = 50*529/529 = 26450/529

-8√6 = -8√6*529/529 = (-4232√6)/529

So, adding together:

26450/529 - 4232√6/529 + 721/529 + 200√6/529

Combine constants: 26450 + 721 = 27171

Combine radicals: (-4232√6 + 200√6) = (-4032√6)

Thus, total: (27171 - 4032√6)/529

Hmm, yeah, that seems correct.

But 27171 divided by 529: Let me check 529*51 = 529*50 + 529 = 26450 + 529 = 26979, which is less than 27171. Difference is 27171 - 26979 = 192. So, 529*51 + 192 = 27171. Similarly, 192/529 cannot be simplified.

Similarly, -4032√6 / 529. 4032 and 529: 529 is 23², 4032 ÷ 23: 23*175 = 4025, remainder 7. So, 4032 = 23*175 +7. Doesn't help.

So, the expression remains (27171 - 4032√6)/529.

Is this reducible? Let me see if 27171 and 529 share a common factor.

529 is 23². 23 divides 27171? Let's check 27171 ÷23:

23*1000=23000, 27171-23000=4171

23*180=4140, 4171-4140=31

31 ÷23 is not integer. So, 27171 isn't divisible by 23. Similarly, 4032 and 529: 4032 ÷23=175.3... Not integer. So, numerator and denominator have no common factors. Hence, the fraction is reduced.

Therefore, a² + b² + c² = (27171 - 4032√6)/529

Therefore, r² = (a² + b² + c²)/4 = [ (27171 - 4032√6)/529 ] /4 = (27171 - 4032√6)/2116

Wait, 529*4=2116. So, yes.

Thus, r² = (27171 - 4032√6)/2116

But this seems complicated. Is there a way to simplify further? Or perhaps my approach is wrong?

Wait, another thought: Maybe instead of assuming a = b, I should consider whether the maximum occurs when all three variables are distinct, but that complicates matters because then all three partial derivatives would need to be considered without symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps using AM-QM inequality or something else.

Wait, another angle: Given that the surface area is fixed and volume is fixed, can I relate a² + b² + c² to these?

I know that for a box, the surface area S = 2(ab + bc + ac), and volume V = abc.

Given S =54, V=23.

I also know that a² + b² + c² ≥ ab + bc + ac, by the well-known inequality that the sum of squares is at least the sum of products.

But in our case, since S = 2(ab + bc + ac) =54, so ab + bc + ac =27.

Thus, a² + b² + c² ≥27.

But we found earlier, in the symmetric case, that a² + b² + c² was 657/16 ≈41.06, which is greater than 27, so that works.

But we are seeking the maximum of a² + b² + c² given the constraints. So, perhaps 27171 - 4032√6 over 529 is indeed the maximum.

But let me see if that makes sense.

Wait, 27171 - 4032√6 over 529.

Compute approximate numerical value:

Compute 4032√6 ≈4032*2.449≈4032*2.449≈approx 4032*2=8064, 4032*0.449≈approx 4032*0.4=1612.8, 4032*0.049≈approx 197.57, so total≈1612.8+197.57≈1810.37, so 4032√6≈8064 +1810.37≈9874.37

Thus, numerator≈27171 -9874.37≈17296.63

Denominator=529

Thus, 17296.63 /529≈approx 17296.63 ÷529≈approx 32.73

So, r²≈32.73 /4≈8.18

Wait, that doesn’t make sense because earlier, when a =2, c=5.75, a² + b² + c² was 657/16≈41.06, so r²≈41.06 /4≈10.265

But wait, in the other case, r²≈32.73 /4≈8.18, which is smaller.

Wait, that contradicts. Wait, no, in fact, in the symmetric case, r²≈10.265, but in the a≠b case, r²≈8.18. That suggests that the maximum occurs when a=b, but in reality, in our computation, the a=b case gave us 657/16≈41.06, which led to r²≈10.265, which is bigger than the other case.

But according to the calculations above, the maximum a² + b² + c² is achieved when a = -1 + 2√6, which leads to a lower value of a² + b² + c² compared to the a = b case. That seems contradictory.

Wait, maybe I messed up in the substitution.

Wait, when a = b, c is larger, leading to a larger a² + b² + c², whereas when a ≠ b, c is smaller, making a² + b² + c² smaller. So, in the case where a = b, we get a larger a² + b² + c², which is correct.

Therefore, the maximum of a² + b² + c² is indeed 657/16≈41.06, leading to r²≈41.06/4≈10.265

But wait, in the a ≠ b case, we obtained a higher value, but upon closer look, when a = b, a² + b² + c² is higher than when a ≠ b. Wait, that can't be.

Wait, let me verify: When a = b =2, c=23/4=5.75

Compute a² + b² + c²= 4 +4 +33.0625=41.0625

When a = -1 + 2√6≈3.898, c≈1.513, a²≈15.19, b²=a²≈15.19, c²≈2.289

Thus, total≈15.19 +15.19 +2.289≈32.669, which is less than 41.0625

So, in the a = b case, we have a higher a² + b² + c², which is correct.

Therefore, the maximum a² + b² + c² is 657/16, so r²=(657/16)/4=657/64

Wait, hold on: 657/16 divided by 4 is 657/(16*4)=657/64

So, r²=657/64.

Check if 657 and 64 are coprime. 64 is 2⁶. 657 ÷2=328.5, so not integer. 657 ÷3=219, which is integer, but 64 isn't divisible by 3. So, GCD(657,64)=1, since 64 is power of 2 and 657 is odd. Wait, no: 657 is 64*10 +17, so 657 is odd, so co-prime with 64.

Wait, 657 divided by 3: 6+5+7=18, which is divisible by 3, so 657=3*219=3*3*73.

64=2^6, so no common factors.

Hence, 657/64 is reduced, so p=657, q=64, so p+q=657+64=721.

Wait, but hold on, earlier, I thought that in the a≠b case, we had a² + b² + c²≈32.669, which is less than 41.0625, so the maximum is indeed 657/16, thus r²=657/64≈10.265625.

But wait, just to make sure, is 657/16 the maximum?

Wait, perhaps I missed other critical points.

Wait, another thought: perhaps when two variables are equal, and the third is different, you get extremum points, but sometimes, the maximum may occur when one variable tends to infinity, but in our case, since the volume is fixed, variables can't go to infinity. So, perhaps the maximum is indeed attained when two variables are equal.

Alternatively, maybe the maximum is when one variable approaches zero, but since the volume is fixed, as one variable approaches zero, the product of the other two must approach infinity, but the surface area would then tend to infinity as well, which conflicts with the surface area constraint. So, perhaps the maximum is indeed at the symmetric point.

But in our earlier analysis, the case when a = b gave a higher value, so perhaps that's the maximum.

Wait, but in order to ensure that this is indeed the global maximum, maybe we need to check the second derivative or Hessian, but that's more complex.

Alternatively, consider that for given surface area and volume, the box with maximum space diagonal is when it's most "stretched", which intuitively would be when two dimensions are as large as possible and one is as small as possible, but due to the volume constraint, you can't make one dimension too small without making others too large, but perhaps when two dimensions are equal, and the third is different, you get the maximum.

But in our computations, when a = b, we got a higher a² + b² + c², so perhaps that's the maximum.

Alternatively, perhaps using AM >= GM.

Wait, but we have two constraints: ab + bc + ac =27, and abc=23.

We can consider that for fixed ab + bc + ac, the product abc is given, and we want to maximize a² + b² + c².

In general, for given ab + bc + ac and abc, the sum a² + b² + c² is maximized when two variables are equal, and the third is different, or when one variable is as large as possible given the constraints.

But in our case, the maximum seems to occur when two variables are equal, as per our earlier result.

Hence, tentatively, I think the maximum a² + b² + c² is 657/16, so r²=657/64, so p+q=657+64=721.

But wait, just to cross-validate, let me compute r² in both cases:

Case 1: a = b =2, c=23/4

Space diagonal squared: 2² + 2² + (23/4)^2=4 +4 + (529/16)=8 +33.0625=41.0625=657/16

Thus, r²=657/(16*4)=657/64≈10.265625

Case 2: a = -1 + 2√6, c=(25 +4√6)/23

Space diagonal squared≈32.669, so r²≈32.669/4≈8.167

Thus, clearly, Case 1 gives a larger r², so the minimal sphere that contains all boxes must have r²=657/64, so p=657, q=64, p+q=721.

Therefore, the answer is 721.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{721}

Given the problem, we need to find the smallest sphere that can contain all rectangular boxes with a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. We aim to determine the radius \( r \) of this sphere and express \( r^2 \) as a fraction \( \frac{p}{q} \), then find \( p + q \).

First, we recognize that the radius \( r \) of the sphere is half the space diagonal of the box. The space diagonal \( d \) of a box with sides \( a, b, c \) is given by:
\[ d = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2} \]
Thus, the radius \( r \) is:
\[ r = \frac{\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}}{2} \]
and
\[ r^2 = \frac{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}{4} \]

We need to maximize \( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 \) subject to the constraints:
1. Surface area: \( 2(ab + bc + ac) = 54 \) which simplifies to \( ab + bc + ac = 27 \)
2. Volume: \( abc = 23 \)

We assume \( a = b \) to simplify the problem. This leads to:
\[ a^2 + 2ac = 27 \]
\[ a^2 c = 23 \]

Solving these, we find:
\[ c = \frac{23}{a^2} \]
Substituting into the surface area constraint:
\[ a^2 + 2a \left( \frac{23}{a^2} \right) = 27 \]
\[ a^2 + \frac{46}{a} = 27 \]

Multiplying through by \( a \):
\[ a^3 - 27a + 46 = 0 \]

Using the Rational Root Theorem, we find \( a = 2 \) is a root. Factoring out \( (a - 2) \), we solve the remaining quadratic:
\[ a^3 - 27a + 46 = (a - 2)(a^2 + 2a - 23) = 0 \]

The roots are \( a = 2 \) and \( a = -1 \pm 2\sqrt{6} \). Considering positive roots, we have \( a = 2 \) and \( a = -1 + 2\sqrt{6} \).

For \( a = 2 \):
\[ c = \frac{23}{4} \]
Calculating \( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 \):
\[ 2^2 + 2^2 + \left( \frac{23}{4} \right)^2 = 4 + 4 + \frac{529}{16} = 8 + 33.0625 = 41.0625 = \frac{657}{16} \]

Thus, \( r^2 = \frac{657}{16 \times 4} = \frac{657}{64} \).

The fraction \( \frac{657}{64} \) is in simplest form, so \( p = 657 \) and \( q = 64 \). Therefore, \( p + q = 657 + 64 = 721 \).

\[
\boxed{721}
\]
