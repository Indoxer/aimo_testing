 The problem: 
A circle with radius $6$ is externally tangent to a circle with radius $24$. Find the area of the triangular region bounded by the three common tangent lines of these two circles.


Alright, so I've got this geometry problem here. It says that there's a circle with radius 6 and another with radius 24, and they're externally tangent. I need to find the area of the triangular region bounded by their three common tangent lines. Hmm, okay. Let me try to visualize this first.

First off, when two circles are externally tangent, they touch each other at exactly one point, right? So, in this case, the distance between their centers should be equal to the sum of their radii. That would make it 6 + 24 = 30 units apart. Okay, so if I imagine the two circles sitting next to each other, just barely touching, their centers are 30 units apart.

Now, the problem mentions the three common tangent lines. Wait, hold on. Common tangents... For two circles, depending on their positions, you can have different types of common tangents. If they're externally tangent, as in this case, they have three common tangents: two external ones and one at the point where they touch each other. But actually, no, wait. When two circles are externally tangent, they have three common tangents: two external ones and one common tangent at the point of contact. So, that makes sense. So, these three lines form a triangle, and we need to find its area.

Let me draw a rough sketch in my mind. There are two circles, one bigger than the other. The smaller one has radius 6, the larger one has radius 24. They touch each other externally at one point. The common external tangents will touch each circle at different points, not at the point where they meet. These three tangent lines—two external and one at the meeting point—should form a triangle somewhere outside the two circles.

Wait, but how does this triangle come about? The three tangent lines must intersect each other at three distinct points, forming a triangle. The point where the two external tangents meet and the point where each external tangent meets the common tangent at the contact point. Hmm, maybe not. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the three common tangents themselves enclose a triangular region. So, each pair of common tangents intersects at a point, and those three intersection points form a triangle. Since all three common tangents are lines, any two of them will intersect unless they're parallel. In this case, since the circles are externally tangent, their common external tangents are not parallel; they should intersect at some point. Similarly, the common tangent at the contact point is another line which will also intersect the external tangents. So yes, the three lines form a triangle when they intersect each other.

So, to find the area of this triangle, I probably need to find the coordinates of the three vertices where the tangent lines intersect each other. Alternatively, maybe I can find the lengths of the sides or use coordinate geometry to compute the area.

But before diving into coordinates, let me see if there's a more geometric approach. Maybe using similar triangles or properties of tangents.

I recall that for two circles, the length of the common external tangent can be calculated using the formula:

Length of external tangent = √[d² - (r1 + r2)²]

Wait, no, that's for internal tangent. Wait, no, actually, let me get this straight. The length of the external tangent between two circles is given by √[d² - (r1 - r2)²], where d is the distance between centers, and r1 and r2 are the radii.

Wait, now I'm getting confused. Let me verify.

For two circles with radii r1 and r2, separated by a distance d between centers, the length of the external tangent is indeed √[d² - (r1 - r2)²]. While the length of the internal tangent is √[d² - (r1 + r2)²]. Wait, but in our case, the circles are externally tangent, so the distance between centers is d = r1 + r2 = 30. So, plugging that into the formula for the external tangent length would give √[30² - (24 - 6)²] = √[900 - 324] = √576 = 24. Hmm, interesting. So the length of the external tangent is 24 units.

But wait, if the circles are externally tangent, wouldn't the external tangent length be zero? Because they already touch at one point. Hmm, perhaps I messed up the formula.

Wait, maybe I had it backwards. Let me check.

No, actually, when two circles are externally tangent, the external tangent doesn't collapse to zero because external tangents are those that don't cross between the circles. Wait, but if they're externally tangent, meaning they touch at one point, then perhaps there isn't an external tangent that doesn't pass through that point? No, that doesn't seem right. Actually, even when circles are externally tangent, you can still have two separate external tangents that don't pass through the point of contact. So, the formula should still apply.

Wait, so if the distance between centers is 30, and radii are 6 and 24, then the difference in radii is 18, so the external tangent length is √(30² - 18²) = √(900 - 324) = √576 = 24. So, each external tangent has length 24.

But then, how does this help with the area of the triangle formed by the three common tangents?

Maybe I should consider the triangle formed by the three common tangents as a sort of outer triangle relative to the two circles. Let's denote the two circles as Circle A (radius 6) and Circle B (radius 24). The common external tangents will touch each circle at one point, and the common internal tangent (the one at the contact point) will form the third side.

Wait, but in the case of externally tangent circles, the internal tangent is the line that touches both circles at their single point of contact. So, actually, that tangent line is just the line that is tangent to both circles at that single point where they touch. So, it's like a common tangent line at the point of contact.

Therefore, the three common tangents consist of two external tangents and one common tangent at the contact point. So, these three lines form a triangle. To find the area of that triangle, we need to figure out the coordinates or the distances involved.

Alternatively, perhaps we can model this situation with coordinate geometry. Let me set up a coordinate system where the center of Circle A is at (0,0), and the center of Circle B is at (30,0), since the distance between centers is 30.

So, Circle A: (x)^2 + y^2 = 6^2 = 36

Circle B: (x - 30)^2 + y^2 = 24^2 = 576

Now, we can find the equations of the common external tangents. Once we have those, we can find their intersection points and thereby determine the vertices of the triangle.

To find the equations of the external tangents, I can use the formula for external tangents between two circles.

Given two circles, one at (0,0) with radius r1=6, and the other at (d,0)= (30,0) with radius r2=24.

The slope of the external tangent can be found by considering similar triangles or using the point where the tangent touches each circle.

Alternatively, I remember that the angle θ made by the tangent with the line connecting the centers can be found using the formula tanθ = (r2 - r1)/distance between centers. Wait, no, that might be for internal tangents.

Wait, actually, for external tangents, the formula is tanθ = (r1 + r2)/d, but I need to confirm.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let's assume that the external tangent will touch Circle A at point P and Circle B at point Q. Then, the lines from the centers to these tangent points, OP and O'Q, will be perpendicular to the tangent line. Therefore, triangles OPO' and O'QO'' (where O'' is the extension) are similar.

Wait, maybe a better way is to use coordinates.

Let me suppose that one of the external tangent lines has equation y = mx + c. This line must satisfy the condition that the distance from the center of Circle A to the line is equal to 6, and the distance from the center of Circle B to the line is equal to 24.

The formula for the distance from a point (x0, y0) to the line ax + by + c = 0 is |ax0 + by0 + c| / sqrt(a² + b²).

In our case, the line is y = mx + c, which can be rewritten as mx - y + c = 0. So, a = m, b = -1, c = c.

Distance from (0,0) to this line is |0 + 0 + c| / sqrt(m² + 1) = |c| / sqrt(m² + 1) = 6

Similarly, distance from (30,0) to the line is |m*30 - 0 + c| / sqrt(m² + 1) = |30m + c| / sqrt(m² + 1) = 24

So, we have two equations:

1) |c| = 6 sqrt(m² + 1)

2) |30m + c| = 24 sqrt(m² + 1)

Since the tangent is external, the signs of c and 30m + c should be opposite. Otherwise, if they were same sign, it would be an internal tangent.

Therefore, let's assume c is positive, so 30m + c is negative. Therefore, we can write:

c = 6 sqrt(m² + 1)

and

-(30m + c) = 24 sqrt(m² + 1)

Substituting c from the first equation into the second:

-30m - 6 sqrt(m² + 1) = 24 sqrt(m² + 1)

Bring all terms to one side:

-30m = 24 sqrt(m² + 1) + 6 sqrt(m² + 1)

Simplify RHS:

-30m = 30 sqrt(m² + 1)

Divide both sides by 30:

-m = sqrt(m² + 1)

Square both sides:

m² = m² + 1

Wait, that gives 0 = 1, which is impossible. Hmm, did I make a mistake in the assumption?

Wait, let's double-check the setup. We assumed c is positive, leading to 30m + c being negative. But when we squared both sides, we ended up with an impossibility. Perhaps the signs are different. Maybe c is negative?

Let me try again.

Assume c is negative, so |c| = -c, and |30m + c| could be either positive or negative depending on the value.

But if c is negative, let's say c = -6 sqrt(m² + 1)

Then, the second equation becomes |30m + c| = |30m - 6 sqrt(m² + 1)| = 24 sqrt(m² + 1)

So, either 30m - 6 sqrt(m² + 1) = 24 sqrt(m² + 1)

or -(30m - 6 sqrt(m² + 1)) = 24 sqrt(m² + 1)

Case 1: 30m - 6 sqrt(m² + 1) = 24 sqrt(m² + 1)

30m = 30 sqrt(m² + 1)

Divide both sides by 30:

m = sqrt(m² + 1)

Square both sides:

m² = m² + 1 => 0 = 1, which is impossible.

Case 2: -(30m - 6 sqrt(m² + 1)) = 24 sqrt(m² + 1)

Which simplifies to:

-30m + 6 sqrt(m² + 1) = 24 sqrt(m² + 1)

Bring like terms together:

-30m = 24 sqrt(m² + 1) - 6 sqrt(m² + 1)

Simplify RHS:

-30m = 18 sqrt(m² + 1)

Divide both sides by 6:

-5m = 3 sqrt(m² + 1)

Now, square both sides:

25 m² = 9 (m² + 1)

25 m² = 9 m² + 9

16 m² = 9

m² = 9/16

Thus, m = ± 3/4

But let's look back at the equation:

-5m = 3 sqrt(m² + 1)

Since sqrt(m² + 1) is always positive, the RHS is positive, so LHS must also be positive.

Thus, -5m > 0 => m < 0

So, m must be negative. So, m = -3/4

Therefore, m = -3/4

Now, substitute back to find c.

From earlier, c = -6 sqrt(m² + 1) = -6 sqrt( (9/16) + 1 ) = -6 sqrt(25/16) = -6*(5/4) = -30/4 = -15/2

Therefore, the equation of the tangent line is y = (-3/4)x - 15/2

Similarly, there must be another external tangent symmetric with respect to the x-axis. So, replacing m with -m and c with +15/2.

Hence, the other tangent line is y = (3/4)x + 15/2

So, now we have two external tangent lines:

1) y = (-3/4)x - 15/2

2) y = (3/4)x + 15/2

And the third common tangent is the one at the point of contact of the two circles.

Since the circles are externally tangent at one point, the common tangent at that point is the line that is tangent to both circles at that point. Given that the centers are along the x-axis, the point of contact should lie along the line connecting the centers, i.e., the x-axis.

Wait, actually, no. The point of contact is on the line connecting the centers, which is the x-axis. So, the tangent at that point is perpendicular to the radius, which is along the x-axis. Hence, the tangent line is vertical.

But wait, if the point of contact is along the x-axis, then the tangent line would be vertical. Is that correct?

Wait, no. Let me think. If two circles are externally tangent, their point of contact is colinear with their centers. So, if the centers are at (0,0) and (30,0), the point of contact is somewhere along the x-axis between them.

Actually, for externally tangent circles, the point of contact divides the line connecting the centers in the ratio of their radii. So, the distance from Circle A's center to the point of contact is proportional to its radius over the sum of radii.

So, the point P is located at ( (6*30)/(6+24), 0 ) = ( (180)/30, 0 ) = (6, 0 )

Wait, hold on. Wait, actually, the point of contact is located at a distance of radius A from Circle A towards Circle B, and similarly, radius B from Circle B towards Circle A.

So, since Circle A is at (0,0) with radius 6, and Circle B is at (30,0) with radius 24, the point of contact P is located 6 units away from (0,0) along the line towards (30,0). So, the coordinates of P would be (6,0). Similarly, from Circle B's perspective, it's 24 units away from (30,0) towards (0,0), which is also (6,0). So, the point of contact is at (6,0).

Therefore, the common tangent at this point is perpendicular to the radius at that point. Since the radius is along the x-axis from (0,0) to (6,0), the tangent line is vertical, as it is perpendicular to the horizontal radius.

Therefore, the equation of the tangent line at (6,0) is x = 6.

So, now we have all three common tangent lines:

1) y = (-3/4)x - 15/2

2) y = (3/4)x + 15/2

3) x = 6

Now, to find the vertices of the triangular region bounded by these lines, we need to find the points where each pair of lines intersect.

So, let's find the intersection points.

First, find where line 1 intersects line 3.

Line 1: y = (-3/4)x - 15/2

Line 3: x = 6

Substitute x = 6 into Line 1:

y = (-3/4)(6) - 15/2 = (-18/4) - 15/2 = (-9/2) - 15/2 = (-24)/2 = -12

So, intersection point A is (6, -12)

Second, find where line 2 intersects line 3.

Line 2: y = (3/4)x + 15/2

Line 3: x = 6

Substitute x = 6:

y = (3/4)(6) + 15/2 = (18/4) + 15/2 = (9/2) + (15/2) = 24/2 = 12

So, intersection point B is (6, 12)

Third, find where line 1 intersects line 2.

Line 1: y = (-3/4)x - 15/2

Line 2: y = (3/4)x + 15/2

Set them equal:

(-3/4)x - 15/2 = (3/4)x + 15/2

Bring all terms to left side:

(-3/4 - 3/4)x - 15/2 - 15/2 = 0

(-6/4)x - 30/2 = 0

Simplify:

(-3/2)x - 15 = 0

Multiply both sides by -2:

3x + 30 = 0

3x = -30

x = -10

Substitute x = -10 into Line 1:

y = (-3/4)(-10) - 15/2 = (30/4) - 15/2 = (15/2) - (15/2) = 0

So, intersection point C is (-10, 0)

Therefore, the three vertices of the triangle are:

A: (6, -12)

B: (6, 12)

C: (-10, 0)

Now, to find the area of triangle ABC with these vertices.

One way to calculate the area is using the shoelace formula.

Shoelace formula states that for points (x1,y1), (x2,y2), (x3,y3):

Area = | (x1(y2 - y3) + x2(y3 - y1) + x3(y1 - y2)) / 2 |

Plugging in the coordinates:

x1 = 6, y1 = -12

x2 = 6, y2 = 12

x3 = -10, y3 = 0

Compute each term:

First term: x1(y2 - y3) = 6*(12 - 0) = 6*12 = 72

Second term: x2(y3 - y1) = 6*(0 - (-12)) = 6*12 = 72

Third term: x3(y1 - y2) = (-10)*(-12 - 12) = (-10)*(-24) = 240

Sum these terms: 72 + 72 + 240 = 384

Take absolute value and divide by 2: |384| / 2 = 192

Therefore, the area is 192 square units.

Wait, let me verify that calculation step-by-step.

Compute each component:

First, (y2 - y3): 12 - 0 = 12

Multiply by x1: 6 * 12 = 72

Second, (y3 - y1): 0 - (-12) = 12

Multiply by x2: 6 * 12 = 72

Third, (y1 - y2): (-12) - 12 = -24

Multiply by x3: (-10) * (-24) = 240

Add all three: 72 + 72 + 240 = 384

Divide by 2: 384 / 2 = 192

Yes, that seems correct. So, the area is 192.

Alternatively, we can compute the base and height.

Looking at the coordinates, points A and B are both on x=6, one at (6,12) and the other at (6,-12). So, the distance between A and B is the vertical distance, which is 12 - (-12) = 24 units. So, AB is 24 units long.

Point C is at (-10,0). So, the base of the triangle can be considered as AB, which is 24 units, and the height would be the horizontal distance from point C to the line AB.

But since AB is a vertical line at x=6, the horizontal distance from C (-10,0) to AB is |6 - (-10)| = 16 units.

Therefore, the area is (base * height)/2 = (24 * 16)/2 = (384)/2 = 192.

Same result. So, that confirms the area is 192.

So, after going through the process of finding the equations of the external tangents, computing their intersection points, and then applying the shoelace formula or base-height method, I arrive at the conclusion that the area of the triangular region is 192.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{192}
</think>

Given two circles with radii 6 and 24 that are externally tangent, we need to find the area of the triangular region bounded by their three common tangent lines.

1. **Distance between Centers**: The distance between the centers of the circles is the sum of their radii, which is \(6 + 24 = 30\) units.

2. **Equations of External Tangents**: Using the distance formula and the condition that the distance from the center of each circle to the tangent line equals their respective radii, we derive the equations of the external tangents:
   - The first external tangent line is \(y = -\frac{3}{4}x - \frac{15}{2}\).
   - The second external tangent line is \(y = \frac{3}{4}x + \frac{15}{2}\).
   - The third tangent line is the common tangent at the point of contact, which is \(x = 6\).

3. **Intersection Points**: We find the intersection points of these tangent lines:
   - Intersection of \(y = -\frac{3}{4}x - \frac{15}{2}\) and \(x = 6\) is \((6, -12)\).
   - Intersection of \(y = \frac{3}{4}x + \frac{15}{2}\) and \(x = 6\) is \((6, 12)\).
   - Intersection of \(y = -\frac{3}{4}x - \frac{15}{2}\) and \(y = \frac{3}{4}x + \frac{15}{2}\) is \((-10, 0)\).

4. **Vertices of the Triangle**: The vertices of the triangular region are \((6, -12)\), \((6, 12)\), and \((-10, 0)\).

5. **Area Calculation**: Using the shoelace formula to find the area of the triangle:
   - The coordinates are \((6, -12)\), \((6, 12)\), and \((-10, 0)\).
   - Applying the shoelace formula: 
     \[
     \text{Area} = \left| \frac{1}{2} \left( 6(12 - 0) + 6(0 - (-12)) + (-10)(-12 - 12) \right) \right|
     \]
     \[
     = \left| \frac{1}{2} \left( 72 + 72 + 240 \right) \right| = \left| \frac{1}{2} \times 384 \right| = 192
     \]

Thus, the area of the triangular region is \(\boxed{192}\).
