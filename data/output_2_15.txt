 The problem: 
Let $ABCD$ be a parallelogram with $\angle BAD < 90^\circ.$ A circle tangent to sides $\overline{DA},$ $\overline{AB},$ and $\overline{BC}$ intersects diagonal $\overline{AC}$ at points $P$ and $Q$ with $AP < AQ,$ as shown. Suppose that $AP=3,$ $PQ=9,$ and $QC=16.$ Then the area of $ABCD$ can be expressed in the form $m\sqrt{n},$ where $m$ and $n$ are positive integers, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n.$


To solve the problem, we start by noting that the circle is tangent to the sides \(DA\), \(AB\), and \(BC\) of the parallelogram \(ABCD\). This implies that the circle is an incircle of the triangle \(ABC\) (since the tangents from a point to a circle are equal, and the circle being tangent to \(DA\), \(AB\), and \(BC\) means it is tangent to the extensions of these sides as well).

Given that \(AP = 3\), \(PQ = 9\), and \(QC = 16\), we have \(AC = AP + PQ + QC = 3 + 9 + 16 = 28\). Let the tangency points of the circle with \(DA\), \(AB\), and \(BC\) be \(X\), \(Y\), and \(Z\) respectively. Since the tangents from a point to a circle are equal, we have:
\[AX = AP = 3, \quad XY = YZ = ZB = 9, \quad ZC = QC = 16.\]
Thus, the lengths of the sides of the parallelogram can be determined as follows:
\[AB = AX + XY + YZ = 3 + 9 + 9 = 21,\]
\[BC = BZ + ZC = 9 + 16 = 25.\]
Since \(ABCD\) is a parallelogram, \(AD = BC = 25\) and \(CD = AB = 21\).

Next, we use the fact that the area of a parallelogram can be calculated using the formula involving the diagonals and the angle between them. However, we can also use the fact that the area of the parallelogram is twice the area of triangle \(ABC\). The area of triangle \(ABC\) can be found using the semiperimeter and the inradius of the incircle.

The semiperimeter \(s\) of triangle \(ABC\) is:
\[s = \frac{AB + BC + CA}{2} = \frac{21 + 25 + 28}{2} = 37.\]
Let the inradius be \(r\). The area of triangle \(ABC\) is given by:
\[K = r \cdot s = r \cdot 37.\]
We can also find the area of triangle \(ABC\) using Heron's formula:
\[K = \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)} = \sqrt{37(37-21)(37-25)(37-28)} = \sqrt{37 \cdot 16 \cdot 12 \cdot 9} = \sqrt{576 \cdot 111} = 24 \sqrt{111}.\]
Thus, the area of the parallelogram \(ABCD\) is:
\[2K = 2 \cdot 24 \sqrt{111} = 48 \sqrt{111}.\]
Therefore, \(m = 48\) and \(n = 111\), and the final answer is:
\[m + n = 48 + 111 = 159.\]
The answer is:
\[
\boxed{159}
\]
