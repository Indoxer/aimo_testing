 The problem: 
In isosceles trapezoid $ABCD$, parallel bases $\overline{AB}$ and $\overline{CD}$ have lengths $500$ and $650$, respectively, and $AD=BC=333$. The angle bisectors of $\angle{A}$ and $\angle{D}$ meet at $P$, and the angle bisectors of $\angle{B}$ and $\angle{C}$ meet at $Q$. Find $PQ$.


To find the length \(PQ\) in the isosceles trapezoid \(ABCD\), we start by analyzing the given information and using geometric properties.

First, let's place the trapezoid in a coordinate system for easier calculation. Assume \(A = (0, 0)\), \(B = (500, 0)\), \(D = (x, h)\), and \(C = (x + 650, h)\). Since \(AD = BC = 333\), we can use the distance formula to find \(x\) and \(h\).

The distance \(AD\) is given by:
\[
AD = \sqrt{x^2 + h^2} = 333
\]
The distance \(BC\) is given by:
\[
BC = \sqrt{(x + 650 - 500)^2 + h^2} = \sqrt{(x + 150)^2 + h^2} = 333
\]

Since \(ABCD\) is an isosceles trapezoid, the height \(h\) is the same for both non-parallel sides. We can solve these equations simultaneously. First, square both equations:
\[
x^2 + h^2 = 333^2 = 110889
\]
\[
(x + 150)^2 + h^2 = 333^2 = 110889
\]

Expanding the second equation:
\[
x^2 + 300x + 22500 + h^2 = 110889
\]
Substitute \(x^2 + h^2 = 110889\) into the expanded equation:
\[
110889 + 300x + 22500 = 110889
\]
Simplify to find \(x\):
\[
300x + 22500 = 0
\]
\[
300x = -22500
\]
\[
x = -75
\]

Now substitute \(x = -75\) back into \(x^2 + h^2 = 110889\):
\[
(-75)^2 + h^2 = 110889
\]
\[
5625 + h^2 = 110889
\]
\[
h^2 = 105264
\]
\[
h = \sqrt{105264} = 324
\]

So, the coordinates are \(A = (0, 0)\), \(B = (500, 0)\), \(D = (-75, 324)\), and \(C = (575, 324)\).

Next, we find the coordinates of points \(P\) and \(Q\), which are the intersections of the angle bisectors of \(\angle A\) and \(\angle D\) and \(\angle B\) and \(\angle C\), respectively. Since the trapezoid is isosceles, the angle bisectors of \(\angle A\) and \(\angle D\) are symmetric about the perpendicular bisector of \(AB\) and \(CD\), and similarly for \(\angle B\) and \(\angle C\). Therefore, \(P\) and \(Q\) lie on this perpendicular bisector.

The midpoint of \(AB\) is \((250, 0)\) and the midpoint of \(CD\) is \((587.5, 324)\). The perpendicular bisector is a vertical line through the midpoint of the midpoints of \(AB\) and \(CD\), which is:
\[
x = \frac{250 + 587.5}{2} = 418.75
\]

The y-coordinate of \(P\) and \(Q\) is the same as the height of the trapezoid, which is 324. Therefore, the coordinates of \(P\) and \(Q\) are \((418.75, 162)\).

Finally, the distance \(PQ\) is the horizontal distance between \(P\) and \(Q\):
\[
PQ = |418.75 - 418.75| = 0
\]

Thus, the length \(PQ\) is:
\[
