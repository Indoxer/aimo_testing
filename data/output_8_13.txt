 The problem: 
In isosceles trapezoid $ABCD$, parallel bases $\overline{AB}$ and $\overline{CD}$ have lengths $500$ and $650$, respectively, and $AD=BC=333$. The angle bisectors of $\angle{A}$ and $\angle{D}$ meet at $P$, and the angle bisectors of $\angle{B}$ and $\angle{C}$ meet at $Q$. Find $PQ$.


To solve for the length \(PQ\) in the given isosceles trapezoid \(ABCD\), we start by analyzing the geometry of the trapezoid and the properties of the angle bisectors.

First, let's place the trapezoid on the coordinate plane with \(A = (0, 0)\), \(B = (500, 0)\), \(C = (x, h)\), and \(D = (y, h)\). Since \(AD = BC = 333\) and \(AB = 500\), \(CD = 650\), we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the height \(h\) and the horizontal distances \(x\) and \(y\).

The distance from \(A\) to \(D\) is:
\[AD = \sqrt{x^2 + h^2} = 333.\]
Similarly,
\[BC = \sqrt{(y-500)^2 + h^2} = 333.\]
Since \(AD = BC\), we have:
\[x^2 + h^2 = (y-500)^2 + h^2 \implies x^2 = (y-500)^2 \implies x = y - 500.\]

Also, the length of \(CD\) is:
\[CD = \sqrt{(y-x)^2 + h^2} = 650.\]
Substituting \(x = y - 500\) into the equation for \(CD\), we get:
\[\sqrt{(y - (y - 500))^2 + h^2} = 650 \implies \sqrt{500^2 + h^2} = 650 \implies 500^2 + h^2 = 650^2 \implies 250000 + h^2 = 422500 \implies h^2 = 172500 \implies h = \sqrt{172500} = 250\sqrt{2.9}.\]

Now, we need to find the coordinates of points \(P\) and \(Q\). The angle bisectors of \(\angle A\) and \(\angle D\) meet at point \(P\), and the angle bisectors of \(\angle B\) and \(\angle C\) meet at point \(Q\). In an isosceles trapezoid, the intersection of the angle bisectors of the non-parallel sides lies on the line segment joining the midpoints of the bases.

The midpoints of \(AB\) and \(CD\) are \((250, 0)\) and \((625, 0)\) respectively. Therefore, the line segment joining these midpoints is horizontal and has a length of \(625 - 250 = 375\). The distance \(PQ\) is half of this length because the angle bisectors intersect at the midpoint of this segment.

Thus, the length \(PQ\) is:
\[PQ = \frac{650 - 500}{2} = \frac{150}{2} = 150.\]

Therefore, the length of \(PQ\) is \(\boxed{150}\).
