 The problem: 
Among the 900 residents of Aimeville, there are 195 who own a diamond ring, 367 who own a set of golf clubs, and 562 who own a garden spade. In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things.


To solve this problem, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion for sets.

Let's denote:
- \( A \) as the set of residents owning a diamond ring,
- \( B \) as the set of residents owning a set of golf clubs,
- \( C \) as the set of residents owning a garden spade,
- \( D \) as the set of residents owning a bag of candy hearts.

We need to find the number of residents who own all four items, which is \( |A \cap B \cap C \cap D| \).

First, let's define the following variables:
- Let \( x \) be the number of residents who own all four items.
- Let \( w \) be the number of residents who own exactly two items (already given as 437),
- Let \( y \) be the number of residents who own exactly three items (already given as 234),
- Let \( z \) be the number of residents who own exactly one item.

Given that every resident owns at least one of these items, the total number of residents is the sum of those owning exactly one, exactly two, exactly three, and exactly four items:

\( z + w + y + x = 900 \)

Substituting the known values:
\( z + 437 + 234 + x = 900 \)
\( z + x = 900 - 671 = 229 \)

So, \( z = 229 - x \).

Next, using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, the total number of residents owning any of the four items is:

\( |A \cup B \cup C \cup D| = |A| + |B| + |C| + |D| - |A \cap B| - |A \cap C| - |A \cap D| - |B \cap C| - |B \cap D| - |C \cap D| + |A \cap B \cap C| + |A \cap B \cap D| + |A \cap C \cap D| + |B \cap C \cap D| - |A \cap B \cap C \cap D| \)

Since every resident owns at least one item, \( |A \cup B \cup C \cup D| = 900 \).

So,

\( 900 = |A| + |B| + |C| + |D| - \sum |A_i \cap A_j| + \sum |A_i \cap A_j \cap A_k| - |A \cap B \cap C \cap D| \)

But calculating all these intersections directly seems complicated. Instead, we can relate the number of residents owning exactly k items to the intersection counts.

Each term like \( |A \cap B| \) includes residents who own exactly two items (only A and B), exactly three items (A, B, and one more), and exactly four items (all four). Similarly for other pairwise intersections.

Similarly, each triple intersection \( |A \cap B \cap C| \) includes residents who own exactly three items (A, B, C) and exactly four items (all four).

Therefore, we can express the sums in terms of the numbers of residents owning exactly two, exactly three, and exactly four items.

Letâ€™s denote:
- \( |A \cap B| = a + x \) where \( a \) is the number of residents owning only A and B.
Similarly, all pairwise intersections will have similar forms.

But since we know the number of residents owning exactly two or three items, we can express the sum of all pairwise intersections in terms of the given numbers.

The number of residents owning exactly two items is 437, which corresponds to all possible pairs minus those owning exactly two items and possibly more.

Wait, actually, each pair \( |A \cap B| \) consists of residents who own exactly A and B, plus those who own A, B, and possibly C or D.

Similarly, the number of residents who own exactly two items is the sum over all pairs of residents owning only those two.

But I think it might be better to use the formula that relates the total number of residents to the individual sets and their intersections.

Alternatively, we can use the fact that:

\( \sum |A_i| = N + 3x + 2y + z \)

Where \( N \) is the number of residents owning exactly one item, \( y \) is those owning exactly three, \( x \) exactly four, and so on.

Wait, no, that might not be correct. Let me recall the formula.

In general, for each element counted in the union, the total sum of individual sets counts each element once for each set they belong to. So, for exactly one item, each contributes 1, exactly two contributes 2, exactly three contributes 3, exactly four contributes 4.

Thus, the sum of the sizes of the individual sets is equal to:

\( |A| + |B| + |C| + |D| = z + 2w + 3y + 4x \)

Where \( z \) is the number of people with exactly one item, \( w \) exactly two, \( y \) exactly three, and \( x \) exactly four.

Given that:

Total residents: \( z + w + y + x = 900 \)
Sum of individual sets: \( |A| + |B| + |C| + |D| = z + 2w + 3y + 4x \)

From our earlier substitution, \( z = 229 - x \), and \( w = 437 \), \( y = 234 \).

So, compute \( z + 2w + 3y + 4x \):

\( z + 2w + 3y + 4x = (229 - x) + 2*437 + 3*234 + 4x \)

Calculate each term:

- \( 2*437 = 874 \)
- \( 3*234 = 702 \)
- \( 4x \) remains as is
- \( (229 - x) \) is 229 minus x

So, adding them up:

\( 229 - x + 874 + 702 + 4x = (229 + 874 + 702) + (-x + 4x) = (229 + 874 = 1103; 1103 + 702 = 1805) + (3x) = 1805 + 3x \)

Thus, the sum of the individual sets is \( 1805 + 3x \).

But we also know that:

The sum of individual sets is equal to the sum over each set's size.

Given in the problem:

- \( |A| = 195 \)
- \( |B| = 367 \)
- \( |C| = 562 \)
- \( |D| = 900 \) (since everyone owns a bag of candy hearts)

So, summing them:

\( 195 + 367 + 562 + 900 \)

Compute this:

195 + 367 = 562

562 + 562 = 1124

1124 + 900 = 2024

So, \( |A| + |B| + |C| + |D| = 2024 \)

Earlier, we had:

\( |A| + |B| + |C| + |D| = 1805 + 3x \)

Therefore,

\( 1805 + 3x = 2024 \)

Solve for \( x \):

\( 3x = 2024 - 1805 = 219 \)

So,

\( x = 219 / 3 = 73 \)

Therefore, the number of residents who own all four items is 73.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{73}
</think>

To solve the problem, we use the principle of inclusion-exclusion for sets. We denote the sets as follows:
- \( A \): residents owning a diamond ring,
- \( B \): residents owning a set of golf clubs,
- \( C \): residents owning a garden spade,
- \( D \): residents owning a bag of candy hearts.

We need to find the number of residents who own all four items, denoted as \( |A \cap B \cap C \cap D| \).

Given:
- Total residents: 900
- Residents owning exactly two items: 437
- Residents owning exactly three items: 234

We know that the total number of residents is the sum of those owning exactly one, exactly two, exactly three, and exactly four items:
\[ z + w + y + x = 900 \]
where \( z \) is the number of residents owning exactly one item, \( w \) is those owning exactly two, \( y \) is those owning exactly three, and \( x \) is those owning all four. Substituting the given values:
\[ z + 437 + 234 + x = 900 \]
\[ z + x = 229 \]
Thus, \( z = 229 - x \).

Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, the total number of residents owning any of the four items is:
\[ 900 = |A| + |B| + |C| + |D| - \sum |A_i \cap A_j| + \sum |A_i \cap A_j \cap A_k| - |A \cap B \cap C \cap D| \]

We also know the sum of the individual sets:
\[ |A| + |B| + |C| + |D| = 195 + 367 + 562 + 900 = 2024 \]

Expressing the sum of individual sets in terms of the given numbers:
\[ |A| + |B| + |C| + |D| = z + 2w + 3y + 4x \]
Substituting the known values:
\[ 2024 = (229 - x) + 2 \cdot 437 + 3 \cdot 234 + 4x \]
\[ 2024 = 229 - x + 874 + 702 + 4x \]
\[ 2024 = 1805 + 3x \]
Solving for \( x \):
\[ 3x = 2024 - 1805 \]
\[ 3x = 219 \]
\[ x = 73 \]

Therefore, the number of residents who own all four items is \(\boxed{73}\).
