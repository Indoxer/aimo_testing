 The problem: 
There is a polynomial $P(x)$ with integer coefficients such that\[P(x)=\frac{(x^{2310}-1)^6}{(x^{105}-1)(x^{70}-1)(x^{42}-1)(x^{30}-1)}\]holds for every $0<x<1.$ Find the coefficient of $x^{2022}$ in $P(x)$.


Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the coefficient of \( x^{2022} \) in a polynomial \( P(x) \). The given expression is:

\[
P(x) = \frac{(x^{2310} - 1)^6}{(x^{105} - 1)(x^{70} - 1)(x^{42} - 1)(x^{30} - 1)}
\]

And it's valid for every \( 0 < x < 1 \). Hmm, interesting. So first off, I know that when dealing with polynomials like this, especially with exponents, generating functions or combinatorial interpretations might be useful here.

Let me see, both numerator and denominator are expressions involving \( x^k - 1 \), which reminds me of cyclotomic polynomials or maybe something related to roots of unity. But since we're dealing with generating functions, perhaps I can express everything as power series and then manipulate them accordingly.

Wait, but before diving into that, let me note that \( x \) is between 0 and 1, so all these terms like \( x^{105} \) will be less than 1, making each term in the denominator less than 1 as well. Similarly, the numerator is raised to the 6th power, so it's also going to be less than 1. But how does that help? Maybe not directly, but perhaps thinking about expanding the numerator and denominator as series?

Alternatively, perhaps factoring out some common terms or simplifying the expression. Let me look at the exponents: 2310, 105, 70, 42, 30. Wait a second, these numbers seem familiar—like they could be related to least common multiples (LCMs) or greatest common divisors (GCDs). Let me check their LCMs.

First, let's compute the GCDs between each pair:

- GCD(105, 70): 105 factors into 3×5×7, 70 is 2×5×7, so GCD is 5×7=35.
- GCD(35, 42): 35 is 5×7, 42 is 2×3×7, so GCD is 7.
- GCD(7, 30): 7 is prime, 30 is 2×3×5, so GCD is 1.

Hmm, so the overall GCD isn't particularly high. Let me think differently. Maybe factorizing each exponent:

- 2310: That's a big number. Let me see, 2310 divided by 10 is 231, which is 3×7×11. So 2310 is 2×3×5×7×11.
- 105: 3×5×7
- 70: 2×5×7
- 42: 2×3×7
- 30: 2×3×5

Interesting! So each of these exponents is a product of some subset of the primes 2, 3, 5, 7, 11. Specifically:

- 2310 is the product of all five primes: 2×3×5×7×11.
- 105 is missing 2 and 11.
- 70 is missing 3 and 11.
- 42 is missing 5 and 11.
- 30 is missing 7 and 11.

So, each exponent in the denominator is a product of four primes, omitting one different prime each time. 105 omits 2 and 11? Wait, no—wait, 105 is 3×5×7, so it's missing 2 and 11 compared to 2310. Hmm, actually, each denominator term is missing two primes. Wait, 105 is 3×5×7, which is 2310 without 2 and 11. Similarly, 70 is 2×5×7, which is 2310 without 3 and 11. 42 is 2×3×7, which is 2310 without 5 and 11. 30 is 2×3×5, which is 2310 without 7 and 11. So each denominator term is missing two primes from the full set {2,3,5,7,11}. Each term omits a unique pair: (2,11), (3,11), (5,11), (7,11).

That seems important. So perhaps I can write each denominator term as \( x^{pqrs} - 1 \), where p, q, r, s are four distinct primes from the set {2,3,5,7,11}, each term omitting a different pair.

But maybe that's complicating things. Alternatively, perhaps I can factorize the entire expression. Since all the denominator terms are of the form \( x^{ab} - 1 \), where ab is a product of two primes, and the numerator is \( (x^{2310} - 1)^6 \).

Wait, another thought: Perhaps I can use the formula for geometric series. Remember, \( \frac{1}{1 - x^k} = 1 + x^k + x^{2k} + x^{3k} + \dots \) for |x| < 1. So, if I can express \( P(x) \) as a product of such geometric series, then the coefficient of \( x^{2022} \) would be the number of ways to write 2022 as a sum of multiples of the exponents in the denominator, considering the numerator expansion.

But wait, the numerator is \( (x^{2310} - 1)^6 \). Let's expand that using the binomial theorem:

\[
(x^{2310} - 1)^6 = \sum_{k=0}^6 \binom{6}{k} (-1)^k x^{2310k}
\]

So, expanding the numerator gives us a finite sum: 1 - 6x^{2310} + 15x^{4620} - ... up to 6 terms. But since the denominator is a product of four terms, each of which is a generating function for a geometric series, we can write:

\[
P(x) = \left( \sum_{k=0}^6 \binom{6}{k} (-1)^k x^{2310k} \right) \times \prod_{i=1}^4 \frac{1}{1 - x^{a_i}}
\]

Where each \( a_i \) corresponds to the exponents in the denominator: 105, 70, 42, 30. So, \( a_1 = 105 \), \( a_2 = 70 \), \( a_3 = 42 \), \( a_4 = 30 \).

Therefore, \( P(x) \) becomes:

\[
P(x) = \sum_{k=0}^6 \binom{6}{k} (-1)^k x^{2310k} \times \prod_{i=1}^4 \left( \sum_{m_i=0}^\infty x^{a_i m_i} \right )
\]

Which means,

\[
P(x) = \sum_{k=0}^6 \binom{6}{k} (-1)^k \sum_{m_1=0}^\infty \sum_{m_2=0}^\infty \sum_{m_3=0}^\infty \sum_{m_4=0}^\infty x^{2310k + 105 m_1 + 70 m_2 + 42 m_3 + 30 m_4}
\]

Thus, the coefficient of \( x^n \) in \( P(x) \) is the sum over k from 0 to 6 of \( \binom{6}{k} (-1)^k \) multiplied by the number of non-negative integer solutions \( (m_1, m_2, m_3, m_4) \) to:

\[
2310k + 105 m_1 + 70 m_2 + 42 m_3 + 30 m_4 = n
\]

In our case, \( n = 2022 \). So, the coefficient of \( x^{2022} \) is:

\[
\sum_{k=0}^6 \binom{6}{k} (-1)^k \cdot N(n - 2310k)
\]

Where \( N(s) \) is the number of non-negative integer solutions \( (m_1, m_2, m_3, m_4) \) to:

\[
105 m_1 + 70 m_2 + 42 m_3 + 30 m_4 = s
\]

Since \( s = n - 2310k = 2022 - 2310k \). Now, note that 2310 is larger than 2022 when k ≥ 1, because 2310 ×1 = 2310 > 2022. Therefore, when k ≥1, s becomes negative, which means there are no solutions for those terms. Hence, only k=0 contributes.

Wait, hold on. Let me verify: For k=1, 2310×1=2310, which is greater than 2022. So, 2022 -2310= -288 <0. Similarly, for k=2, 2310×2=4620>2022. So indeed, only k=0 contributes.

Therefore, the coefficient of \( x^{2022} \) is just:

\[
N(2022) = \text{Number of non-negative integer solutions to } 105 m_1 + 70 m_2 + 42 m_3 + 30 m_4 = 2022
\]

So now, the problem reduces to finding the number of non-negative integer solutions \( (m_1, m_2, m_3, m_4) \) satisfying the above equation.

This is a classic Diophantine equation problem. To solve this, perhaps I can simplify the equation by dividing through by a common factor if possible.

Looking at the coefficients: 105, 70, 42, 30. Let's find their GCD.

Compute GCD step by step:

- GCD(105,70): 35
- GCD(35,42): 7
- GCD(7,30): 1

So, the overall GCD is 1. Therefore, the equation is not further reducible.

Another approach is to fix variables one by one and iterate through possible values.

But since this is a manual calculation, let's try to break down the equation.

Firstly, notice that all coefficients are multiples of 5 except perhaps 42. Wait, no:

Wait, 105 = 5×21,

70 = 5×14,

42 = 5×8.4, which is not an integer. Wait, 42 is 6×7, but 30 is 5×6.

Wait, perhaps that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps express the equation in terms of smaller variables. Let me see:

Let me denote:

\( a = m_1 \)

\( b = m_2 \)

\( c = m_3 \)

\( d = m_4 \)

So,

105a + 70b + 42c + 30d = 2022

I can rewrite this as:

Divide both sides by 3 to see if that helps:

35a + (70/3)b + 14c + 10d = 674

Wait, 70 isn't divisible by 3, so that doesn't help much.

Alternatively, perhaps divide by GCD of the coefficients. Since GCD is 1, not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe group terms.

Notice that 105a + 70b = 35*(3a + 2b)

Similarly, 42c + 30d = 6*(7c + 5d)

So, the equation becomes:

35*(3a + 2b) + 6*(7c + 5d) = 2022

Let me denote:

Let me set \( u = 3a + 2b \) and \( v = 7c + 5d \). Then, the equation becomes:

35u + 6v = 2022

Now, we can solve for u and v.

So, 35u + 6v = 2022

We can think of this as a linear Diophantine equation in two variables u and v.

First, let's find all non-negative integer solutions (u, v) to this equation.

To do this, we can solve for v in terms of u:

6v = 2022 -35u

So,

v = (2022 -35u)/6

For v to be an integer, 2022 -35u must be divisible by 6.

Let me compute 2022 mod 6:

2022 ÷ 6 = 337 exactly, so 2022 ≡ 0 mod 6.

Similarly, 35 ≡ 5 mod 6. So,

2022 -35u ≡ 0 -5u mod 6

We require 0 -5u ≡ 0 mod 6 => 5u ≡ 0 mod 6

Since 5 and 6 are coprime, this implies u ≡ 0 mod 6.

Therefore, u must be a multiple of 6. Let me write u = 6t, where t is a non-negative integer.

Substituting back into the equation:

35*(6t) + 6v = 2022

Simplify:

210t + 6v = 2022

Divide both sides by 6:

35t + v = 337

Therefore,

v = 337 -35t

Since v must be non-negative, 337 -35t ≥ 0

Which implies,

35t ≤ 337 => t ≤ 337/35 ≈ 9.628

So, t can take integer values from 0 to 9 inclusive.

Therefore, t ∈ {0,1,2,...,9}

Thus, for each t from 0 to 9, we have a corresponding u =6t and v=337 -35t.

Now, recall that u =3a +2b and v=7c +5d.

So, for each t, we need to find the number of non-negative integer solutions (a,b,c,d) such that:

3a + 2b =6t

and

7c +5d =337 -35t

Therefore, the total number of solutions N(2022) is the sum over t=0 to 9 of [number of solutions to 3a +2b=6t] multiplied by [number of solutions to 7c +5d=337 -35t].

Hence,

N(2022) = Σ_{t=0}^9 [N1(t) * N2(t)]

Where N1(t) is the number of non-negative integer solutions to 3a +2b=6t,

and N2(t) is the number of non-negative integer solutions to 7c +5d=337 -35t.

So, let's compute N1(t) and N2(t) for each t from 0 to9.

Starting with N1(t):

Equation: 3a +2b =6t

Let me solve for b:

2b =6t -3a

=> b=(6t -3a)/2 = 3t - (3a)/2

Since b must be an integer, (3a)/2 must be integer, so a must be even.

Let me set a =2k, where k is a non-negative integer.

Then,

b=3t - (3*2k)/2=3t -3k

Thus, the solutions are determined by:

a=2k,

b=3t -3k,

with constraints:

a ≥0 => 2k ≥0 => k≥0,

b ≥0 => 3t -3k ≥0 => k ≤ t

Hence, for each t, k can range from 0 to t, inclusive.

Thus, the number of solutions N1(t) is t +1.

Because k can take t+1 values (0 to t).

Wait, let me test with small t:

If t=0: 3a +2b=0 => a=0, b=0. So N1(0)=1, which is 0+1=1. Correct.

If t=1: 3a +2b=6.

Possible a: 0,2,4,6,...

But since 3a ≤6, a can be 0,2.

For a=0: b=3

a=2: b=0

So N1(1)=2=1+1. Correct.

Similarly, t=2:

3a +2b=12.

a can be 0,2,4.

For a=0: b=6

a=2: b=3

a=4: b=0

So N1(2)=3=2+1. Correct.

Hence, general formula N1(t)=t+1.

Great, so N1(t)=t+1.

Now, moving on to N2(t):

Equation:7c +5d= S, where S=337 -35t.

We need to find the number of non-negative integer solutions (c,d) to 7c +5d=S.

This is another linear Diophantine equation.

To find N2(t), the number of solutions, we can use the following method:

Given the equation 7c +5d = S,

We can express d=(S -7c)/5.

For d to be an integer, S -7c must be divisible by 5. Thus,

7c ≡ S mod 5.

Since 7≡2 mod5, this implies:

2c ≡ S mod5.

Thus,

c ≡ (2^{-1})*S mod5.

What's the inverse of 2 mod5? It's 3, because 2×3=6≡1 mod5.

Therefore,

c ≡3*S mod5.

So, c must be congruent to 3S mod5.

Moreover, since c must satisfy d=(S -7c)/5 ≥0,

we have:

S -7c ≥0 => c ≤ S/7.

Therefore, c can take values from c_min to c_max, where c_min is the smallest non-negative integer satisfying c ≡3S mod5, and c_max is floor(S/7).

The number of solutions is floor((c_max - c_min)/5) +1.

Wait, more precisely, once we fix c ≡ r mod5, where r=3S mod5, then c can be written as c=5k +r, where k is an integer such that c ≥0 and c ≤ floor(S/7).

Therefore, substituting c=5k + r,

then,

5k + r ≤ floor(S/7)

=> k ≤ (floor(S/7) - r)/5

Thus, the number of k is floor( (floor(S/7) - r)/5 ) +1, provided that floor(S/7) - r ≥0.

Otherwise, if floor(S/7) < r, then no solutions.

Hence, the number of solutions N2(t) is equal to the number of integers k such that:

k ≥0,

k ≤ (floor(S/7) - r)/5,

where r=3S mod5.

Therefore, to compute N2(t), for each t, we can compute S=337 -35t, compute r=3S mod5, compute c_min=r, c_max=floor(S/7),

and then the number of solutions is floor( (c_max - c_min)/5 ) +1, if c_max >=c_min.

Otherwise, zero.

This seems a bit involved, but manageable for t=0 to9.

Let me proceed step by step for each t from 0 to9.

First, let me make a table:

t | S=337 -35t | r=3S mod5 | c_min=r | c_max= floor(S/7) | Number of solutions N2(t)
---|---------|---------|-------|------------|---------
0 | 337    | 3*337=1011; 1011 mod5=1011-5*202=1011-1010=1 → r=1 | c_min=1 | floor(337/7)=48 | floor((48 -1)/5)+1=floor(47/5)=9 +1=10
1 | 337-35=302 | 3*302=906; 906 mod5=906-5*181=906-905=1 → r=1 | c_min=1 | floor(302/7)=43 | floor((43 -1)/5)+1=floor(42/5)=8 +1=9
2 | 337-70=267 | 3*267=801; 801 mod5=801-5*160=801-800=1 → r=1 | c_min=1 | floor(267/7)=38 | floor((38 -1)/5)+1=floor(37/5)=7 +1=8
3 | 337-105=232 | 3*232=696; 696 mod5=696-5*139=696-695=1 → r=1 | c_min=1 | floor(232/7)=33 | floor((33 -1)/5)+1=floor(32/5)=6 +1=7
4 | 337-140=197 | 3*197=591; 591 mod5=591-5*118=591-590=1 → r=1 | c_min=1 | floor(197/7)=28 | floor((28 -1)/5)+1=floor(27/5)=5 +1=6
5 | 337-175=162 | 3*162=486; 486 mod5=486-5*97=486-485=1 → r=1 | c_min=1 | floor(162/7)=23 | floor((23 -1)/5)+1=floor(22/5)=4 +1=5
6 | 337-210=127 | 3*127=381; 381 mod5=381-5*76=381-380=1 → r=1 | c_min=1 | floor(127/7)=18 | floor((18 -1)/5)+1=floor(17/5)=3 +1=4
7 | 337-245=92 | 3*92=276; 276 mod5=276-5*55=276-275=1 → r=1 | c_min=1 | floor(92/7)=13 | floor((13 -1)/5)+1=floor(12/5)=2 +1=3
8 | 337-280=57 | 3*57=171; 171 mod5=171-5*34=171-170=1 → r=1 | c_min=1 | floor(57/7)=8 | floor((8 -1)/5)+1=floor(7/5)=1 +1=2
9 | 337-315=22 | 3*22=66; 66 mod5=66-5*13=66-65=1 → r=1 | c_min=1 | floor(22/7)=3 | floor((3 -1)/5)+1=floor(2/5)=0 +1=1

Wait, let me double-check the last row for t=9:

S=22,

r=3*22 mod5=66 mod5=1,

c_min=1,

c_max=floor(22/7)=3,

so number of solutions is floor( (3 -1)/5 ) +1= floor(2/5)=0 +1=1.

Yes, correct.

So compiling the N2(t):

t=0:10,

t=1:9,

t=2:8,

t=3:7,

t=4:6,

t=5:5,

t=6:4,

t=7:3,

t=8:2,

t=9:1.

Therefore, N2(t)=10-t.

Wait, looking at the table:

At t=0, N2=10,

t=1,N2=9,

...

t=9,N2=1.

Indeed, N2(t)=10 - t.

Therefore, N2(t)=10 - t.

Hence, N1(t)=t +1,

N2(t)=10 - t,

for t=0 to9.

Therefore, the total number of solutions N(2022) is:

Σ_{t=0}^9 (t +1)*(10 - t )

Compute this sum:

Let me compute each term:

t=0: (0+1)*(10 -0)=1*10=10

t=1:2*9=18

t=2:3*8=24

t=3:4*7=28

t=4:5*6=30

t=5:6*5=30

t=6:7*4=28

t=7:8*3=24

t=8:9*2=18

t=9:10*1=10

Now, add all these up:

10 +18=28

28+24=52

52+28=80

80+30=110

110+30=140

140+28=168

168+24=192

192+18=210

210+10=220

So, the total number of solutions is 220.

Therefore, the coefficient of \( x^{2022} \) in \( P(x) \) is 220.

Wait, hold on—is that it? Because earlier, I concluded that only k=0 contributes, hence N(2022)=220. So yes, the coefficient is 220.

But just to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors in computing the sum:

List of products:

10,18,24,28,30,30,28,24,18,10.

Let me add them step by step:

Start with 10.

10 +18=28

28 +24=52

52 +28=80

80 +30=110

110 +30=140

140 +28=168

168 +24=192

192 +18=210

210 +10=220

Yes, that adds up correctly.

Therefore, the coefficient is 220.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{220}
</think>

To find the coefficient of \( x^{2022} \) in the polynomial \( P(x) \), we start with the given expression:

\[
P(x) = \frac{(x^{2310} - 1)^6}{(x^{105} - 1)(x^{70} - 1)(x^{42} - 1)(x^{30} - 1)}
\]

We use the binomial theorem to expand the numerator:

\[
(x^{2310} - 1)^6 = \sum_{k=0}^6 \binom{6}{k} (-1)^k x^{2310k}
\]

Thus, the polynomial \( P(x) \) can be written as:

\[
P(x) = \sum_{k=0}^6 \binom{6}{k} (-1)^k \sum_{m_1=0}^\infty \sum_{m_2=0}^\infty \sum_{m_3=0}^\infty \sum_{m_4=0}^\infty x^{2310k + 105 m_1 + 70 m_2 + 42 m_3 + 30 m_4}
\]

We need the coefficient of \( x^{2022} \), which requires solving:

\[
2310k + 105 m_1 + 70 m_2 + 42 m_3 + 30 m_4 = 2022
\]

For \( k \geq 1 \), the left-hand side exceeds 2022. Thus, only \( k = 0 \) contributes, simplifying the equation to:

\[
105 m_1 + 70 m_2 + 42 m_3 + 30 m_4 = 2022
\]

We rewrite this as:

\[
35(3m_1 + 2m_2) + 6(7m_3 + 5m_4) = 2022
\]

Let \( u = 3m_1 + 2m_2 \) and \( v = 7m_3 + 5m_4 \). We solve:

\[
35u + 6v = 2022
\]

Finding non-negative integer solutions for \( u \) and \( v \), we determine \( u \) must be a multiple of 6, say \( u = 6t \). This leads to:

\[
35(6t) + 6v = 2022 \implies 210t + 6v = 2022 \implies 35t + v = 337
\]

Thus, \( v = 337 - 35t \). For each \( t \) from 0 to 9, we solve:

\[
3m_1 + 2m_2 = 6t \quad \text{and} \quad 7m_3 + 5m_4 = 337 - 35t
\]

The number of solutions for \( 3m_1 + 2m_2 = 6t \) is \( t + 1 \). For \( 7m_3 + 5m_4 = 337 - 35t \), the number of solutions is \( 10 - t \). Summing the products of these solutions:

\[
\sum_{t=0}^9 (t + 1)(10 - t) = 10 + 18 + 24 + 28 + 30 + 30 + 28 + 24 + 18 + 10 = 220
\]

Thus, the coefficient of \( x^{2022} \) in \( P(x) \) is:

\[
\boxed{220}
\]
