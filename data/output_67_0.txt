 The problem: 
There exist real numbers $x$ and $y$, both greater than 1, such that $\log_x\left(y^x\right)=\log_y\left(x^{4y}\right)=10$. Find $xy$.


Okay, so I've got this problem here where there are two logarithmic equations involving x and y, both of which are greater than 1. The equations are log base x of y^x equals 10, and log base y of x^{4y} also equals 10. And I need to find the product xy.

Hmm, let me write down what's given:

First equation: log_x(y^x) = 10

Second equation: log_y(x^{4y}) = 10

And we know that x > 1 and y > 1. So, both bases are valid for logarithms because they're greater than 1.

I remember that the logarithm log_b(a) can be rewritten using the change of base formula as ln(a)/ln(b), but maybe it's easier to use the definition of logarithms here.

Let me recall that if log_b(a) = c, then b^c = a.

So, applying that to the first equation: log_x(y^x) = 10 means that x^10 = y^x.

Similarly, the second equation: log_y(x^{4y}) = 10 implies that y^10 = x^{4y}.

So now I have two equations:

1) x^10 = y^x

2) y^10 = x^{4y}

So now, I have a system of equations with two variables x and y. I need to solve for x and y, and then compute their product.

Looking at these equations, they seem to relate x and y in an exponential way. Maybe I can take logarithms on both sides or express one variable in terms of the other.

Let me see:

From equation 1: x^10 = y^x

Take natural logarithm on both sides: 10 ln x = x ln y

Similarly, from equation 2: y^10 = x^{4y}

Take natural logarithm on both sides: 10 ln y = 4y ln x

So now I have two new equations:

Equation 3: 10 ln x = x ln y

Equation 4: 10 ln y = 4y ln x

Hmm, okay. Let me denote u = ln x and v = ln y to simplify things.

Then, equation 3 becomes: 10u = x v

Equation 4 becomes: 10v = 4y u

But since u = ln x and v = ln y, perhaps I can write x in terms of u and y in terms of v? Or maybe substitute one into another.

Wait, from equation 3: 10u = x v => x = (10u)/v

From equation 4: 10v = 4y u => y = (10v)/(4u) = (5v)/(2u)

So, x is expressed as (10u)/v, and y is expressed as (5v)/(2u)

Since u = ln x and v = ln y, let's substitute back.

So, u = ln x = ln[(10u)/v] = ln(10u) - ln v

Similarly, v = ln y = ln[(5v)/(2u)] = ln(5v) - ln(2u)

Hmm, that seems a bit complicated, but maybe we can write equations in terms of u and v.

Let me define Equation 5: u = ln(10u) - ln v

Equation 6: v = ln(5v) - ln(2u)

This might not be straightforward, but perhaps if I subtract or manipulate these equations?

Alternatively, maybe I can express u in terms of v or vice versa from one equation and substitute into the other.

Wait, from equation 3: x = (10u)/v

And from equation 4: y = (5v)/(2u)

So, if I can express x in terms of u and v, and y in terms of u and v, maybe plug them into each other.

But wait, x and y themselves are related via equations 1 and 2.

Alternatively, maybe I can express u from equation 3 and v from equation 4 and set up a ratio.

From equation 3: u = (x v)/10

From equation 4: v = (4y u)/10

So, substituting u from equation 3 into equation 4:

v = (4y * (x v)/10)/10 = (4y x v)/(100) = (xy v)/25

So, v = (xy v)/25

Assuming v ≠ 0 (since y > 1, so ln y ≠ 0), we can divide both sides by v:

1 = (xy)/25

Therefore, xy = 25

Oh! Wait, so that's the answer? That seems straightforward.

But hold on, did I do that correctly? Let me check.

Starting again:

From equation 3: 10u = x v => u = (x v)/10

From equation 4: 10v = 4y u => v = (4y u)/10

Substitute u from equation 3 into equation 4:

v = (4y * (x v)/10)/10 = (4y x v)/(100) = (xy v)/25

So, v = (xy /25) v

Divide both sides by v (since v ≠ 0):

1 = xy /25 => xy =25

Yes, that seems correct.

So, without even needing to find x and y individually, we found that their product is 25.

Wait, is that possible? Because sometimes when you have multiple equations, you might lose some constraints, but in this case, it seems consistent.

Let me verify with the original equations whether xy=25 makes sense.

Suppose xy=25. Then, y =25/x.

Let me substitute y into equation 1: x^10 = y^x = (25/x)^x =25^x /x^x

Which would give x^10 =25^x /x^x

Multiply both sides by x^x: x^{10 +x}=25^x

Take natural logs: (10 +x) ln x = x ln25

Hmm, this is getting more complicated. Maybe I should try specific numbers.

Wait, suppose x and y are integers, but 25 factors are limited. Let me see.

If xy=25, possible integer pairs are (1,25),(5,5),(25,1). But since x>1 and y>1, (5,5) is a possibility.

Testing x=5, y=5.

Check equation 1: log_5(5^5)= log_5(5^5)=5=10? No, that gives 5≠10. So that doesn't satisfy equation 1.

Hmm, so x=5, y=5 does not work. Hmm.

Wait, maybe my assumption that xy=25 is incorrect? But according to earlier steps, substitution gave us xy=25 regardless.

Wait, let's see:

We had:

From equation 3: u = (x v)/10

From equation 4: v = (4y u)/10

So substituting u into equation 4:

v = (4y*(x v)/10)/10 = (4xy v)/100 = (xy v)/25

Thus, v = (xy/25)v => xy=25.

This derivation seems solid. So, perhaps the initial thought of testing x=5,y=5 was wrong because it doesn't satisfy the original logarithmic equations.

Wait, let's test x=25, y=1. But y must be greater than 1, so no.

Alternatively, maybe non-integer solutions.

Let me pick xy=25, say x= sqrt(25)=5, but we saw that didn't work. Maybe x= something else.

Alternatively, maybe x=25^(something). Hmm, perhaps instead of plugging in, I can try to solve for x and y.

Given that xy=25, let's let y=25/x.

Substitute y=25/x into equation 1: x^10=(25/x)^x

Which is x^{10} =25^{x}/x^{x}=25^{x} x^{-x}

Multiply both sides by x^x: x^{10 +x}=25^{x}

Take natural logs: (10 +x) ln x = x ln25

Let me write this as:

(10 +x) ln x = x ln25

We can write this as:

(10 +x)/x * ln x = ln25

Simplify (10 +x)/x =1 +10/x

So,

(1 +10/x) ln x = ln25

Hmm, this is still a transcendental equation; probably cannot solve algebraically. Maybe use numerical methods.

Let me make a substitution: Let z = x. Then:

(1 +10/z) ln z = ln25 ≈3.2189

Let me attempt to guess z.

Try z=5:

Left side: (1 +10/5) ln5= (3)(1.6094)=4.8282>3.2189

Too big.

z=10:

Left side: (1+10/10)ln10=2*2.3026≈4.605>3.2189

Still too big.

z=15:

(1 +10/15)ln15≈(1 +0.6667)(2.7080)≈1.6667*2.708≈4.513>3.2189

Still too big.

Wait, increasing z makes left side decrease because (1 +10/z) decreases while ln z increases, but perhaps not enough.

Wait, at z approaching infinity: (1 +10/z) approaches 1, and ln z approaches infinity, so left side tends to infinity. At z approaching 1+: (1 +10/z) ~11, ln z~0, so left side ~0.

Wait, so function crosses somewhere between z=1 and z=5.

Wait, at z=1: left side ~0

At z=2:

(1 +5) ln2≈6*0.6931≈4.1586>3.2189

z=3:

(1 +10/3)ln3≈(4.333)*1.0986≈4.76>3.2189

z=4:

(1 +2.5)ln4≈3.5*1.386≈4.851>3.2189

z=1.5:

(1 +10/1.5)ln1.5≈(1 +6.6667)(0.4055)≈7.6667*0.4055≈3.115<3.2189

Close.

So, at z=1.5: approx 3.115

At z=1.6:

(1 +10/1.6)ln1.6≈(1 +6.25)ln1.6≈7.25*0.4700≈3.408>3.2189

So, between 1.5 and 1.6.

Using linear approximation:

Between z=1.5 (f(z)=3.115) and z=1.6 (f(z)=3.408). We need f(z)=3.2189.

Difference needed:3.2189 -3.115=0.1039

Total difference:3.408 -3.115=0.293

Fraction:0.1039/0.293≈0.3545

So, approximate z=1.5 +0.3545*(0.1)=1.5 +0.03545≈1.53545

Compute f(z) at z=1.53545:

(1 +10/1.53545)ln(1.53545)

Calculate 10/1.53545≈6.513

So, 1 +6.513≈7.513

ln(1.53545)≈0.428

Multiply:7.513*0.428≈3.217

Almost exactly 3.2189. Close enough.

So, z≈1.53545

So, x≈1.53545, y=25/x≈25/1.53545≈16.279

So, approximate solution x≈1.535, y≈16.279, product xy≈25.

Thus, despite not being integers, the product is indeed 25.

Hence, the answer is 25.

**Final Answer**
The value of \( xy \) is \boxed{25}.
</think>

Given the problem, we need to find the product \( xy \) where both \( x \) and \( y \) are greater than 1. The equations provided are:

1. \(\log_x(y^x) = 10\)
2. \(\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10\)

First, we convert these logarithmic equations into their exponential forms:

1. \( x^{10} = y^x \)
2. \( y^{10} = x^{4y} \)

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides of these equations, we get:

1. \( 10 \ln x = x \ln y \)
2. \( 10 \ln y = 4y \ln x \)

Let \( u = \ln x \) and \( v = \ln y \). Substituting these into the equations, we have:

1. \( 10u = xv \)
2. \( 10v = 4yu \)

From the first equation, we express \( x \) in terms of \( u \) and \( v \):

\[ x = \frac{10u}{v} \]

From the second equation, we express \( y \) in terms of \( u \) and \( v \):

\[ y = \frac{5v}{2u} \]

Substituting \( x \) and \( y \) back into each other, we get:

\[ u = \ln\left(\frac{10u}{v}\right) \]
\[ v = \ln\left(\frac{5v}{2u}\right) \]

However, a simpler approach is to substitute \( x \) from the first equation into the second. This leads to:

\[ v = \frac{xyv}{25} \]

Assuming \( v \neq 0 \), we can divide both sides by \( v \):

\[ 1 = \frac{xy}{25} \]

Thus, we find:

\[ xy = 25 \]

Therefore, the value of \( xy \) is \(\boxed{25}\).
