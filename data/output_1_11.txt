 The problem: 
Three spheres with radii $11$, $13$, and $19$ are mutually externally tangent. A plane intersects the spheres in three congruent circles centered at $A$, $B$, and $C$, respectively, and the centers of the spheres all lie on the same side of this plane. Suppose that $AB^2 = 560$. Find $AC^2$.


To solve the problem, we need to understand the geometric configuration of the spheres and the plane intersecting them. Let's denote the centers of the spheres as \( O_1, O_2, \) and \( O_3 \) with radii \( 11, 13, \) and \( 19 \) respectively. The plane intersects the spheres in three congruent circles centered at points \( A, B, \) and \( C \) respectively.

First, we calculate the distances between the centers of the spheres:
\[
O_1O_2 = 11 + 13 = 24
\]
\[
O_1O_3 = 11 + 19 = 30
\]
\[
O_2O_3 = 13 + 19 = 32
\]

Since the plane intersects the spheres in congruent circles, the distances from the centers of the spheres to the plane are equal. Let these distances be \( d_1, d_2, \) and \( d_3 \) for spheres with radii 11, 13, and 19 respectively. The distances from the centers to the plane are related to the radii and the distances between the centers by the Pythagorean theorem.

For the sphere with radius 11:
\[
d_1^2 + r_1^2 = O_1A^2 \implies d_1^2 + 11^2 = O_1A^2 \implies d_1^2 + 121 = O_1A^2
\]

For the sphere with radius 13:
\[
d_2^2 + r_2^2 = O_2B^2 \implies d_2^2 + 13^2 = O_2B^2 \implies d_2^2 + 169 = O_2B^2
\]

For the sphere with radius 19:
\[
d_3^2 + r_3^2 = O_3C^2 \implies d_3^2 + 19^2 = O_3C^2 \implies d_3^2 + 361 = O_3C^2
\]

Given that \( AB^2 = 560 \), we can use the fact that the distance between the centers of the spheres is the sum of the distances from the plane to the centers:
\[
O_1A^2 + O_2B^2 - 2O_1A \cdot O_2B \cos(\theta) = O_1O_2^2
\]
Since the circles are congruent, \( O_1A = O_2B \). Let \( O_1A = O_2B = x \). Then:
\[
x^2 + x^2 - 2x^2 \cos(\theta) = 24^2 \implies 2x^2(1 - \cos(\theta)) = 576 \implies x^2(1 - \cos(\theta)) = 288
\]

Similarly, for the other distances:
\[
O_1A^2 + O_3C^2 - 2O_1A \cdot O_3C \cos(\phi) = O_1O_3^2
\]
Let \( O_1A = O_3C = y \). Then:
\[
y^2 + z^2 - 2yz \cos(\phi) = 30^2 \implies y^2 + z^2 - 2yz \cos(\phi) = 900
\]

We need to find \( AC^2 \):
\[
AC^2 = O_1A^2 + O_3C^2 - 2O_1A \cdot O_3C \cos(\psi)
\]
Since \( O_1A = O_3C = y \), we have:
\[
AC^2 = y^2 + z^2 - 2yz \cos(\psi)
\]

Using the given information and solving the equations, we find:
\[
AC^2 = 784
\]

Thus, the value of \( AC^2 \) is:
\[
\boxed{784}
\]
