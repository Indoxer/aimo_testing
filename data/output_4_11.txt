 The problem: 
Let $S$ be the set of all rational numbers that can be expressed as a repeating decimal in the form $0.\overline{abcd},$ where at least one of the digits $a,$ $b,$ $c,$ or $d$ is nonzero. Let $N$ be the number of distinct numerators obtained when numbers in $S$ are written as fractions in lowest terms. For example, both $4$ and $410$ are counted among the distinct numerators for numbers in $S$ because $0.\overline{3636} = \frac{4}{11}$ and $0.\overline{1230} = \frac{410}{3333}.$ Find the remainder when $N$ is divided by $1000.$


To solve the problem, we need to understand the structure of the repeating decimals of the form \(0.\overline{abcd}\). A repeating decimal \(0.\overline{abcd}\) can be expressed as a fraction:

\[
0.\overline{abcd} = \frac{abcd}{9999}
\]

where \(abcd\) represents the four-digit number formed by the digits \(a, b, c, d\). Since \(a, b, c, d\) are digits and at least one of them is nonzero, \(abcd\) ranges from 1000 to 9999. The fraction \(\frac{abcd}{9999}\) is in its lowest terms if and only if the greatest common divisor (gcd) of \(abcd\) and 9999 is 1. The prime factorization of 9999 is:

\[
9999 = 3^2 \times 11 \times 101
\]

Thus, \(abcd\) must not be divisible by 3, 11, or 101 for the fraction to be in its lowest terms. We will use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to count the number of such \(abcd\).

First, we calculate the total number of four-digit numbers, which is 9000 (from 1000 to 9999). Next, we subtract the numbers that are divisible by 3, 11, or 101.

The number of four-digit multiples of 3 is:

\[
\left\lfloor \frac{9999}{3} \right\rfloor - \left\lfloor \frac{999}{3} \right\rfloor = 3333 - 333 = 3000
\]

The number of four-digit multiples of 11 is:

\[
\left\lfloor \frac{9999}{11} \right\rfloor - \left\lfloor \frac{99}{11} \right\rfloor = 909 - 9 = 900
\]

The number of four-digit multiples of 101 is:

\[
\left\lfloor \frac{9999}{101} \right\rfloor - \left\lfloor \frac{99}{101} \right\rfloor = 99 - 0 = 99
\]

The number of four-digit multiples of \(3 \times 11 = 33\) is:

\[
\left\lfloor \frac{9999}{33} \right\rfloor - \left\lfloor \frac{99}{33} \right\rfloor = 303 - 3 = 300
\]

The number of four-digit multiples of \(3 \times 101 = 303\) is:

\[
\left\lfloor \frac{9999}{303} \right\rfloor - \left\lfloor \frac{99}{303} \right\rfloor = 33 - 0 = 33
\]

The number of four-digit multiples of \(11 \times 101 = 1111\) is:

\[
\left\lfloor \frac{9999}{1111} \right\rfloor - \left\lfloor \frac{99}{1111} \right\rfloor = 9 - 0 = 9
\]

The number of four-digit multiples of \(3 \times 11 \times 101 = 3333\) is:

\[
\left\lfloor \frac{9999}{3333} \right\rfloor - \left\lfloor \frac{99}{3333} \right\rfloor = 3 - 0 = 3
\]

Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, the number of four-digit numbers divisible by 3, 11, or 101 is:

\[
3000 + 900 + 99 - 300 - 33 - 9 + 3 = 3660
\]

Therefore, the number of four-digit numbers that are not divisible by 3, 11, or 101 is:

\[
9000 - 3660 = 5340
\]

Thus, the number of distinct numerators obtained when numbers in \(S\) are written as fractions in lowest terms is 5340. The remainder when 5340 is divided by 1000 is:

\[
\boxed{340}
\]
