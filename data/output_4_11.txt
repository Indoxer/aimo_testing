 The problem: 
Let $S$ be the set of all rational numbers that can be expressed as a repeating decimal in the form $0.\overline{abcd},$ where at least one of the digits $a,$ $b,$ $c,$ or $d$ is nonzero. Let $N$ be the number of distinct numerators obtained when numbers in $S$ are written as fractions in lowest terms. For example, both $4$ and $410$ are counted among the distinct numerators for numbers in $S$ because $0.\overline{3636} = \frac{4}{11}$ and $0.\overline{1230} = \frac{410}{3333}.$ Find the remainder when $N$ is divided by $1000.$


To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of distinct numerators of rational numbers in the set \( S \) when expressed in lowest terms. The set \( S \) consists of all rational numbers that can be expressed as a repeating decimal of the form \( 0.\overline{abcd} \), where \( a, b, c, d \) are digits and at least one of them is nonzero.

First, let's express \( 0.\overline{abcd} \) as a fraction. A repeating decimal \( 0.\overline{abcd} \) can be written as:
\[
0.\overline{abcd} = \frac{abcd}{9999}
\]
where \( abcd \) represents the four-digit number formed by the digits \( a, b, c, \) and \( d \).

Next, we need to reduce this fraction to its lowest terms. The numerator \( abcd \) ranges from 1 to 9999 (since at least one digit is nonzero). We need to count the number of distinct numerators when these fractions are in their lowest terms.

To do this, we use the Euler's totient function \( \phi(n) \), which counts the number of integers up to \( n \) that are coprime with \( n \). We will apply this function to the denominator 9999.

First, factorize 9999:
\[
9999 = 3^2 \times 11 \times 101
\]

The totient function \( \phi(9999) \) is given by:
\[
\phi(9999) = 9999 \left(1 - \frac{1}{3}\right) \left(1 - \frac{1}{11}\right) \left(1 - \frac{1}{101}\right)
\]

Calculating each term:
\[
1 - \frac{1}{3} = \frac{2}{3}, \quad 1 - \frac{1}{11} = \frac{10}{11}, \quad 1 - \frac{1}{101} = \frac{100}{101}
\]

Thus,
\[
\phi(9999) = 9999 \times \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{10}{11} \times \frac{100}{101}
\]

Simplify step-by-step:
\[
9999 \times \frac{2}{3} = 6666
\]
\[
6666 \times \frac{10}{11} = 6060
\]
\[
6060 \times \frac{100}{101} = 6000
\]

So, \( \phi(9999) = 6000 \).

This means there are 6000 integers up to 9999 that are coprime with 9999. Therefore, there are 6000 distinct numerators when the fractions \( \frac{abcd}{9999} \) are in their lowest terms.

Finally, we need the remainder when \( N = 6000 \) is divided by 1000:
\[
6000 \mod 1000 = 0
\]

Thus, the remainder when \( N \) is divided by 1000 is:
\[
\boxed{0}
\]
