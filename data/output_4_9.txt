 The problem: 
Let $S$ be the set of all rational numbers that can be expressed as a repeating decimal in the form $0.\overline{abcd},$ where at least one of the digits $a,$ $b,$ $c,$ or $d$ is nonzero. Let $N$ be the number of distinct numerators obtained when numbers in $S$ are written as fractions in lowest terms. For example, both $4$ and $410$ are counted among the distinct numerators for numbers in $S$ because $0.\overline{3636} = \frac{4}{11}$ and $0.\overline{1230} = \frac{410}{3333}.$ Find the remainder when $N$ is divided by $1000.$


To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of distinct numerators when rational numbers in the set \( S \) are written as fractions in lowest terms. The set \( S \) consists of all rational numbers that can be expressed as a repeating decimal in the form \( 0.\overline{abcd} \), where at least one of the digits \( a, b, c, d \) is nonzero.

First, let's express a repeating decimal \( 0.\overline{abcd} \) as a fraction. A repeating decimal \( 0.\overline{abcd} \) can be written as:
\[
0.\overline{abcd} = \frac{abcd}{9999}
\]
where \( abcd \) represents the four-digit number formed by the digits \( a, b, c, d \).

Next, we need to consider the fractions in their lowest terms. To do this, we must reduce the fraction \( \frac{abcd}{9999} \) to its simplest form by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD).

The prime factorization of 9999 is:
\[
9999 = 3^2 \times 11 \times 101
\]

Thus, the GCD of \( abcd \) and 9999 must be a divisor of 9999. We need to count the distinct numerators obtained after reducing \( \frac{abcd}{9999} \) to its lowest terms.

The distinct numerators will be all integers from 1 to 9998 that are coprime with 9999. This is because any number that shares a common factor with 9999 can be reduced further.

To find the number of integers from 1 to 9998 that are coprime with 9999, we use Euler's Totient Function, denoted as \( \phi(n) \). Euler's Totient Function counts the number of integers up to \( n \) that are coprime with \( n \).

For \( n = 9999 \):
\[
\phi(9999) = 9999 \left(1 - \frac{1}{3}\right) \left(1 - \frac{1}{11}\right) \left(1 - \frac{1}{101}\right)
\]

Calculating each term:
\[
1 - \frac{1}{3} = \frac{2}{3}
\]
\[
1 - \frac{1}{11} = \frac{10}{11}
\]
\[
1 - \frac{1}{101} = \frac{100}{101}
\]

Now, multiply these fractions together:
\[
\phi(9999) = 9999 \times \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{10}{11} \times \frac{100}{101}
\]

Simplify the multiplication step-by-step:
\[
9999 \times \frac{2}{3} = 6666
\]
\[
6666 \times \frac{10}{11} = 6060
\]
\[
6060 \times \frac{100}{101} = 6000
\]

Thus, the number of distinct numerators \( N \) is 6000.

Finally, we need to find the remainder when \( N \) is divided by 1000:
\[
6000 \mod 1000 = 0
\]

Therefore, the remainder when \( N \) is divided by 1000 is:
\[
\boxed{0}
\]
