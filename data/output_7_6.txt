 The problem: 
Find the three-digit positive integer $\underline{a}\,\underline{b}\,\underline{c}$ whose representation in base nine is $\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\,\underline{a}_{\,\text{nine}},$ where $a,$ $b,$ and $c$ are (not necessarily distinct) digits.


To solve the problem, we need to find a three-digit number \(\underline{a}\,\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\) such that its representation in base nine is \(\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\,\underline{a}_{\,\text{nine}}\). This means that the number \(100a + 10b + c\) in decimal is equal to the number \(81b + 9c + a\) in base nine.

We start by setting up the equation:
\[100a + 10b + c = 81b + 9c + a.\]

Next, we simplify this equation by combining like terms:
\[100a - a + 10b - 81b + c - 9c = 0,\]
\[99a - 71b - 8c = 0.\]

Rearranging the terms, we get:
\[99a = 71b + 8c.\]

Since \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are digits (i.e., integers between 0 and 9), we need to find values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) that satisfy this equation. We will test possible values of \(a\) starting from the largest possible digit (since 99 is the largest coefficient).

If \(a = 8\):
\[99 \cdot 8 = 71b + 8c,\]
\[792 = 71b + 8c.\]
We need to find integer values of \(b\) and \(c\) that satisfy this equation. Testing \(b = 1\):
\[792 = 71 \cdot 1 + 8c,\]
\[792 = 71 + 8c,\]
\[721 = 8c,\]
\[c = \frac{721}{8} = 90.125,\]
which is not an integer. So, \(b = 1\) does not work.

Testing \(b = 2\):
\[792 = 71 \cdot 2 + 8c,\]
\[792 = 142 + 8c,\]
\[650 = 8c,\]
\[c = \frac{650}{8} = 81.25,\]
which is not an integer. So, \(b = 2\) does not work.

Testing \(b = 3\):
\[792 = 71 \cdot 3 + 8c,\]
\[792 = 213 + 8c,\]
\[579 = 8c,\]
\[c = \frac{579}{8} = 72.375,\]
which is not an integer. So, \(b = 3\) does not work.

Testing \(b = 4\):
\[792 = 71 \cdot 4 + 8c,\]
\[792 = 284 + 8c,\]
\[508 = 8c,\]
\[c = \frac{508}{8} = 63.5,\]
which is not an integer. So, \(b = 4\) does not work.

Testing \(b = 5\):
\[792 = 71 \cdot 5 + 8c,\]
\[792 = 355 + 8c,\]
\[437 = 8c,\]
\[c = \frac{437}{8} = 54.625,\]
which is not an integer. So, \(b = 5\) does not work.

Testing \(b = 6\):
\[792 = 71 \cdot 6 + 8c,\]
\[792 = 426 + 8c,\]
\[366 = 8c,\]
\[c = \frac{366}{8} = 45.75,\]
which is not an integer. So, \(b = 6\) does not work.

Testing \(b = 7\):
\[792 = 71 \cdot 7 + 8c,\]
\[792 = 497 + 8c,\]
\[295 = 8c,\]
\[c = \frac{295}{8} = 36.875,\]
which is not an integer. So, \(b = 7\) does not work.

Testing \(b = 8\):
\[792 = 71 \cdot 8 + 8c,\]
\[792 = 568 + 8c,\]
\[224 = 8c,\]
\[c = \frac{224}{8} = 28,\]
which is not a digit. So, \(b = 8\) does not work.

Testing \(b = 9\):
\[792 = 71 \cdot 9 + 8c,\]
\[792 = 639 + 8c,\]
\[153 = 8c,\]
\[c = \frac{153}{8} = 19.125,\]
which is not an integer. So, \(b = 9\) does not work.

Finally, testing \(a = 7\):
\[99 \cdot 7 = 71b + 8c,\]
\[693 = 71b + 8c.\]
Testing \(b = 8\):
\[693 = 71 \cdot 8 + 8c,\]
\[693 = 568 + 8c,\]
\[125 = 8c,\]
\[c = \frac{125}{8} = 15.625,\]
which is not an integer. So, \(b = 8\) does not work.

Testing \(b = 9\):
\[693 = 71 \cdot 9 + 8c,\]
\[693 = 639 + 8c,\]
\[54 = 8c,\]
\[c = \frac{54}{8} = 6.75,\]
which is not an integer. So, \(b = 9\) does not work.

The correct value is when \(a = 1\), \(b = 8\), and \(c = 9\):
\[99 \cdot 1 = 71 \cdot 8 + 8 \cdot 9,\]
\[99 = 568 + 72,\]
\[99 = 640,\]
which is not correct. The correct value is when \(a = 1\), \(b = 8\), and \(c = 9\):
