 The problem: 
Three spheres with radii $11$, $13$, and $19$ are mutually externally tangent. A plane intersects the spheres in three congruent circles centered at $A$, $B$, and $C$, respectively, and the centers of the spheres all lie on the same side of this plane. Suppose that $AB^2 = 560$. Find $AC^2$.


To solve for \( AC^2 \), we start by considering the geometry of the problem. We have three spheres with radii \( r_1 = 11 \), \( r_2 = 13 \), and \( r_3 = 19 \) that are mutually externally tangent. A plane intersects these spheres in three congruent circles centered at points \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \), respectively.

First, we need to find the distances between the centers of the spheres. Let the centers of the spheres be \( O_1 \), \( O_2 \), and \( O_3 \). The distance between any two centers is the sum of their radii:
\[
O_1O_2 = r_1 + r_2 = 11 + 13 = 24
\]
\[
O_2O_3 = r_2 + r_3 = 13 + 19 = 32
\]
\[
O_1O_3 = r_1 + r_3 = 11 + 19 = 30
\]

Next, we consider the plane that intersects the spheres. Since the circles are congruent and centered at \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \), the distances from the centers of the spheres to the plane are proportional to the radii of the spheres. Let the distances from \( O_1 \), \( O_2 \), and \( O_3 \) to the plane be \( d_1 \), \( d_2 \), and \( d_3 \), respectively. We have:
\[
d_1 + d_2 = r_1 = 11
\]
\[
d_2 + d_3 = r_2 = 13
\]
\[
d_1 + d_3 = r_3 = 19
\]

We can solve these equations to find \( d_1 \), \( d_2 \), and \( d_3 \). Adding all three equations:
\[
(d_1 + d_2) + (d_2 + d_3) + (d_1 + d_3) = 11 + 13 + 19
\]
\[
2(d_1 + d_2 + d_3) = 43
\]
\[
d_1 + d_2 + d_3 = \frac{43}{2} = 21.5
\]

Now, we can find each individual distance:
\[
d_1 = (d_1 + d_2 + d_3) - (d_2 + d_3) = 21.5 - 13 = 8.5
\]
\[
d_2 = (d_1 + d_2 + d_3) - (d_1 + d_3) = 21.5 - 19 = 2.5
\]
\[
d_3 = (d_1 + d_2 + d_3) - (d_1 + d_2) = 21.5 - 11 = 10.5
\]

We are given that \( AB^2 = 560 \). Since \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) are the centers of the congruent circles, the distance \( AB \) is the same as the distance between the centers of the spheres minus twice the radius of the circles. However, since the circles are congruent and the plane is equidistant from the centers of the spheres, we can use the fact that the distance between the centers of the spheres is the sum of the distances from the plane to the centers.

Thus, the distance \( AC \) is:
\[
AC = \sqrt{(d_1 - d_3)^2 + (d_1 - d_3)^2} = \sqrt{(8.5 - 10.5)^2 + (8.5 - 10.5)^2} = \sqrt{(-2)^2 + (-2)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 4} = \sqrt{8} = 2\sqrt{2}
\]

Therefore, \( AC^2 \) is:
\[
AC^2 = (2\sqrt{2})^2 = 4 \times 2 = 8
\]

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{8}
\]
