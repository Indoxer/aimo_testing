 The problem: 
Find the three-digit positive integer $\underline{a}\,\underline{b}\,\underline{c}$ whose representation in base nine is $\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\,\underline{a}_{\,\text{nine}},$ where $a,$ $b,$ and $c$ are (not necessarily distinct) digits.


<think>
Okay, so I have this problem here that says: Find the three-digit positive integer abc (where a, b, c are digits) such that when you write it in base nine, it's represented as bc a_nine. Hmm, okay, let me try to wrap my head around this.

First, let me make sure I understand the notation correctly. The number abc is a three-digit number in base ten, right? So, in base ten, that would be 100*a + 10*b + c. On the other hand, the number bc a_nine is a number in base nine. Wait, hold on—does that mean it's written as b c a in base nine, or is it bc_a in base nine?

Wait, maybe I misread. It says "the representation in base nine is bc a_nine." So, actually, it's a three-digit number in base nine: first digit b, second digit c, third digit a. So, in base nine, that would translate to 81*b + 9*c + a. Because each digit represents powers of nine: 9^2, 9^1, and 9^0.

So, we're told that the base ten number abc equals the base nine number bc a_nine. So:

100*a + 10*b + c = 81*b + 9*c + a

Is that correct? Let me just verify. Yes, because the left side is the base ten number, which is 100*a + 10*b + c, and the right side is the base nine number, which is 81*b + 9*c + a.

So, now we can set up the equation:

100a + 10b + c = 81b + 9c + a

Let me rearrange terms to bring similar ones together.

Subtract a from both sides:

99a + 10b + c = 81b + 9c

Now, subtract 81b and 9c from both sides:

99a + 10b - 81b + c - 9c = 0

Simplify:

99a - 71b - 8c = 0

So, we have 99a = 71b + 8c

Hmm, okay. Now, since a, b, c are digits, their values are constrained. In base ten, a, b, c can be 0-9, but a can't be zero because it's a three-digit number. Similarly, in the base nine representation, the digits b, c, a must be between 0 and 8 because base nine digits go from 0 to 8. So, actually, a, b, c are all digits from 0 to 8, with a not being zero.

So, a ∈ {1,2,...,8}, b,c ∈ {0,1,...,8}

So, our variables are limited to these ranges. So, 99a = 71b + 8c

Our goal is to find integers a, b, c in those ranges satisfying the above equation.

So, let's think about how to approach this.

Maybe express c in terms of a and b, or something like that.

From 99a = 71b + 8c, solve for c:

8c = 99a - 71b

Therefore,

c = (99a - 71b)/8

Since c has to be an integer between 0 and 8, inclusive, the numerator must be divisible by 8, and the result must be between 0 and 8.

So, 99a - 71b must be divisible by 8, and the result after division must be an integer between 0 and 8.

Alternatively, perhaps modulo arithmetic could help here.

Let me compute 99 mod 8 and 71 mod 8.

Compute 99 ÷ 8: 8*12=96, so remainder 3. So, 99 ≡ 3 mod8.

Similarly, 71 ÷8: 8*8=64, so 71-64=7, so 71≡7 mod8.

Thus, the equation becomes:

(3a -7b) ≡0 mod8

Because 99a -71b ≡0 mod8 translates to 3a -7b ≡0 mod8.

So, 3a ≡7b mod8.

We need to find integers a and b (with a from 1-8, b from 0-8) such that 3a ≡7b mod8.

Also, remember that c=(99a -71b)/8 must be an integer between 0 and 8.

So, perhaps we can iterate over possible values of a and b, compute c, and check if it's an integer in the required range.

Alternatively, maybe there's a smarter way.

But considering that a and b are single digits, with a from 1-8, and b from 0-8, the total number of combinations isn't too large, so it might be feasible to do some sort of table or equation.

Alternatively, let's see if we can find a relationship between a and b.

From 3a ≡7b mod8.

Multiply both sides by the modular inverse of 3 mod8.

What's the inverse of 3 mod8? Looking for x such that 3x ≡1 mod8.

Testing x=3: 3*3=9≡1 mod8. So, inverse is 3.

Hence, multiplying both sides:

a ≡3*(7b) mod8 => a ≡21b mod8.

21 mod8 is 5, since 8*2=16, 21-16=5.

Thus, a ≡5b mod8.

Therefore, a ≡5b mod8.

So, a =5b +8k, for some integer k.

But since a is between 1 and8, and b is between0 and8, let's see what possible a and b can satisfy this.

So, a =5b mod8, meaning that a is congruent to 5b modulo8.

Which implies that a = (5b mod8). But since a has to be at least1, we can ignore cases where 5b mod8 is zero and instead set a= (5b mod8).

But wait, actually, more precisely, a ≡5b mod8, but a must be in 1-8, so a can be equal to (5b mod8), unless 5b mod8=0, then a=8.

Wait, that may not necessarily always be the case. Let's think again.

Suppose 5b ≡ m mod8, where m is between0 and7. Then a must be either m or m+8, but since a is less than or equal to8, a=m if m≠0, else a=8.

Wait, no. Let's take specific examples.

Take b=0: 5*0=0, so a≡0 mod8, so a=8.

b=1: 5*1=5, so a≡5 mod8, thus a=5.

b=2:5*2=10≡2 mod8, so a=2.

b=3:15≡7 mod8, so a=7.

b=4:20≡4 mod8, so a=4.

b=5:25≡1 mod8, so a=1.

b=6:30≡6 mod8, so a=6.

b=7:35≡35-32=3 mod8, so a=3.

b=8:40≡0 mod8, so a=8.

So, summarizing:

For each b from0-8, a is as follows:

b | a
---|---
0 |8
1 |5
2 |2
3 |7
4 |4
5 |1
6 |6
7 |3
8 |8

So, now, with a determined based on b, we can substitute into the original equation to get c.

Recall that c = (99a -71b)/8

Given that a is dependent on b, we can compute c for each b and check whether it's an integer between0 and8.

So, let's go through each value of b and compute c:

Case 1: b=0, a=8

c=(99*8 -71*0)/8=(792 -0)/8=792/8=99

But c must be ≤8, so discard this.

Case 2: b=1, a=5

c=(99*5 -71*1)/8=(495 -71)/8=424/8=53

Again, c=53>8, invalid.

Case3: b=2, a=2

c=(99*2 -71*2)/8=(198 -142)/8=56/8=7

c=7, which is valid (since 0≤7≤8). So, this is a possible solution.

Let me note this down: a=2, b=2, c=7.

Wait, hold on. Wait, a=2, b=2, c=7.

Wait, but let's check if this satisfies the original equation.

Original equation: 100a +10b +c=81b +9c +a

Left side:100*2 +10*2 +7=200 +20 +7=227

Right side:81*2 +9*7 +2=162 +63 +2=227

Yes, that works. Hmm, so 227 is a possible solution.

But let's continue checking other cases, just to ensure if there are multiple solutions or if this is unique.

Case4: b=3, a=7

c=(99*7 -71*3)/8=(693 -213)/8=480/8=60

c=60>8, invalid.

Case5: b=4, a=4

c=(99*4 -71*4)/8=(396 -284)/8=112/8=14

c=14>8, invalid.

Case6: b=5, a=1

c=(99*1 -71*5)/8=(99 -355)/8=(-256)/8=-32

c=-32<0, invalid.

Case7: b=6, a=6

c=(99*6 -71*6)/8=(594 -426)/8=168/8=21

c=21>8, invalid.

Case8: b=7, a=3

c=(99*3 -71*7)/8=(297 -497)/8=(-200)/8=-25

c=-25<0, invalid.

Case9: b=8, a=8

c=(99*8 -71*8)/8=(792 -568)/8=224/8=28

c=28>8, invalid.

So, among all the cases, only when b=2 did we get a valid c=7.

Therefore, the digits are a=2, b=2, c=7.

So, the three-digit number is 2 2 7, which is 227.

But wait, let me double-check to ensure I didn't make any mistakes.

First, confirm that in base nine, bc a_nine is 2 7 2 in base nine, right?

So, that is 2*81 +7*9 +2= 162 +63 +2=227.

Which is the same as the base ten number 227.

So, yes, that checks out.

I also want to ensure that I didn't miss any other possible cases, especially since sometimes when dealing with modular equations, you might have multiple solutions.

Looking back at my earlier calculations, for each b from0-8, I found a corresponding a, and then computed c. Only when b=2 did c fall within 0-8.

Therefore, it seems that 227 is the only solution.

Just to be thorough, let me consider if there's another way to represent numbers in base nine. For example, does leading zeros matter? Well, in the problem statement, it specifies the number is a three-digit positive integer, so in base nine, bc a_nine is indeed a three-digit number, with b, c, a as its digits. Since a is non-zero in base ten, and in base nine, a is also a digit, so a cannot be zero, which is consistent.

Additionally, in base nine, the digits must be less than9, which they are, so everything seems consistent.

Another thing to check is if I interpreted the representations correctly. The problem states that the three-digit number abc (base ten) is equal to bc a in base nine.

So, abc in base ten is 100a +10b +c, and bc a in base nine is 81b +9c +a.

Yes, that's correct.

Hence, I think my solution is solid.

**Final Answer**
The three-digit number is \boxed{227}.
</think>

To find the three-digit positive integer $\underline{a}\underline{b}\underline{c}$ whose representation in base nine is $\underline{b}\underline{c}\underline{a}_{\text{nine}}$, we start by translating the given conditions into an equation.

The three-digit number in base ten is $100a + 10b + c$. Its representation in base nine, $\underline{b}\underline{c}\underline{a}_{\text{nine}}$, translates to $81b + 9c + a$ in base ten. Therefore, we set up the equation:

\[ 100a + 10b + c = 81b + 9c + a \]

Rearranging and simplifying the equation, we get:

\[ 99a - 71b - 8c = 0 \]
\[ 99a = 71b + 8c \]

We know that $a, b, c$ are digits in base nine, meaning they must be integers between 0 and 8, with $a \neq 0$. We use modular arithmetic to simplify the problem. By considering the equation modulo 8, we find:

\[ 99a \equiv 71b \pmod{8} \]
\[ 3a \equiv 7b \pmod{8} \]

Multiplying both sides by the modular inverse of 3 modulo 8 (which is 3), we get:

\[ a \equiv 21b \pmod{8} \]
\[ a \equiv 5b \pmod{8} \]

This gives us possible values for $a$ based on $b$. We then calculate $c$ for each valid pair $(a, b)$ and check if $c$ is a valid digit (0-8).

After checking all possible values, we find that when $b = 2$, $a = 2$, and $c = 7$, the equation holds. This results in the three-digit number $227$.

Verifying, we convert $\underline{b}\underline{c}\underline{a}_{\text{nine}}$ (which is $272_{\text{nine}}$) to base ten:

\[ 2 \cdot 81 + 7 \cdot 9 + 2 = 162 + 63 + 2 = 227 \]

Thus, the three-digit number is \(\boxed{227}\).
