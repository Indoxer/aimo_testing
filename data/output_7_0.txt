 The problem: 
Find the three-digit positive integer $\underline{a}\,\underline{b}\,\underline{c}$ whose representation in base nine is $\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\,\underline{a}_{\,\text{nine}},$ where $a,$ $b,$ and $c$ are (not necessarily distinct) digits.


<think>
Alright, so I need to find a three-digit number in base 10, which is represented as abc. But here's the catch: when this number is converted to base nine, it becomes bc a in base nine. Hmm, that's interesting. Let me try to break this down.

First off, let's clarify what each notation means. The number abc in base 10 is straightforward—it's just 100*a + 10*b + c. On the other hand, the number bc a in base nine is a bit trickier because it's written in base nine. So, if I parse that correctly, bc a in base nine would translate to b*9^2 + c*9 + a. Wait, hold on—is that right? Because in base nine, the digits represent powers of nine. So the first digit from the left is the hundreds place in base nine, which is 9^2, then the next is the nines place, 9^1, and the last is units, 9^0.

So, translating bc a from base nine to base ten should be b*81 + c*9 + a. Got it. So, the equation we have is:

100*a + 10*b + c = b*81 + c*9 + a

Hmm, okay, so both sides equal each other because they're the same number but represented in different bases. So, my job is to solve for a, b, c where a, b, c are digits. Remember, since it's a three-digit number in base ten, a can't be zero. Also, in base nine, the digits b and c must be between 0 and 8 inclusive because base nine digits go from 0 to 8. Similarly, in the original number, a, b, c are digits in base ten, so they must be between 0 and 9, but a can't be zero.

So, our variables a, b, c are integers with:
- a ∈ {1, 2, ..., 9}
- b, c ∈ {0, 1, ..., 8}

Wait, hold on—actually, in base nine, the digits bc a must all be valid base nine digits, meaning each of them has to be less than 9. Therefore, b, c, a must all be between 0 and 8. However, in the original number, abc is a base ten number, so a can be up to 9, but since a is also part of the base nine number bc a, it must satisfy a < 9 as well. So, actually, a, b, c must all be between 0 and 8, but a cannot be zero because it's the leading digit in a three-digit number.

Therefore, a ∈ {1, 2, ..., 8}, and b, c ∈ {0, 1, ..., 8}.

Okay, so now let's write down the equation again:

100a + 10b + c = 81b + 9c + a

Let me rearrange this equation to group like terms together.

Subtract a from both sides:

100a - a + 10b + c = 81b + 9c

Which simplifies to:

99a + 10b + c = 81b + 9c

Now, subtract 81b and 9c from both sides:

99a + 10b + c - 81b - 9c = 0

Simplify the terms:

99a - 71b - 8c = 0

So, the equation we have is:

99a = 71b + 8c

Our goal is to find integers a, b, c within their respective ranges (a: 1-8; b, c: 0-8) such that 99a equals 71b plus 8c.

Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this.

Since a, b, c are all small integers, maybe I can iterate through possible values of a and see if 99a can be expressed as 71b + 8c for some b and c within the given ranges.

Alternatively, perhaps I can look at this equation modulo something to narrow down possibilities.

Looking at 99a ≡ 71b + 8c mod something. Maybe mod 8 or mod 71?

Let's try modulo 8 first because 8 is a coefficient on the right side.

Compute 99a mod 8: 99 divided by 8 is 12*8=96, remainder 3. So 99 ≡ 3 mod 8. Therefore, 99a ≡ 3a mod 8.

Similarly, 71b mod 8: 71 divided by 8 is 8*8=64, remainder 7. So 71 ≡ 7 mod 8, so 71b ≡ 7b mod 8.

And 8c mod 8 is 0 because it's a multiple of 8.

Thus, the equation modulo 8 becomes:

3a ≡ 7b mod 8

So, 3a - 7b ≡ 0 mod 8.

That gives us a relationship between a and b.

We can write this as 3a ≡ 7b mod 8.

To make this easier, perhaps find inverses. Since 3 and 7 are coefficients, maybe we can multiply both sides by an inverse modulo 8 to express a in terms of b or vice versa.

The inverse of 3 mod 8 is a number x such that 3x ≡ 1 mod 8. Testing x= 3: 3*3=9≡1 mod8. Yes, inverse is 3.

Similarly, the inverse of 7 mod8 is needed. 7*7=49≡1 mod8, so inverse is 7.

So, multiplying both sides by 3:

(3*3)a ≡ (3*7)b mod8 => 9a ≡ 21b mod8 => Simplify 9 and 21 mod8.

9 mod8=1, 21 mod8=5. So,

1a ≡ 5b mod8 => a ≡5b mod8

So, a ≡5b mod8.

Given that a and b are integers between 0 and 8 (with a ≥1), this congruence gives us a relation.

Therefore, a =5b +8k, where k is an integer such that a remains ≤8.

But since a must be between 1 and8, let's consider possible values of b and corresponding a.

Let me tabulate possible b and compute a =5b mod8, but more precisely, a = (5b) mod8, but since a must be positive, and a can be written as a=5b -8m, where m is chosen such that a is in [1,8].

Wait, maybe it's better to list all possible b from 0 to8, compute 5b mod8, and see if a is within 1-8.

Let me do that:

For b=0: a≡0 mod8 → a=0, but a≥1, so invalid.

b=1: a≡5 mod8 → a=5.

Check if a=5 is allowed: yes, since a=5≤8.

b=2: a≡10 mod8→10-8=2. So, a=2.

b=3: a≡15 mod8→15-8=7. So, a=7.

b=4: a≡20 mod8→20-16=4. So, a=4.

b=5: a≡25 mod8→25-24=1. So, a=1.

b=6: a≡30 mod8→30-24=6. So, a=6.

b=7: a≡35 mod8→35-32=3. So, a=3.

b=8: a≡40 mod8→40-40=0. But a=0 is invalid.

So, summarizing:

b : a

0 : invalid

1 :5

2 :2

3 :7

4 :4

5 :1

6 :6

7 :3

8 :invalid

So, possible pairs of (b,a):

(1,5), (2,2), (3,7), (4,4), (5,1), (6,6), (7,3)

So, these are the possible (b,a) pairs.

Now, recall the original equation: 99a =71b +8c

We can plug in these pairs into this equation and solve for c.

Remember that c must be an integer between 0 and8.

Let me process each pair:

1. (b,a)=(1,5):

99*5=71*1 +8c

Calculate LHS: 99*5=495

RHS:71*1=71, so 71+8c=495

So, 8c=495-71=424

Then, c=424/8=53.

But wait, c must be ≤8. 53>8, invalid. So discard this pair.

2. (b,a)=(2,2):

99*2=71*2 +8c

LHS:198

RHS:142 +8c

So, 198-142=56=8c

Thus, c=56/8=7.

c=7, which is valid (since 0≤7≤8). So, this pair works.

So, potential solution: a=2, b=2, c=7.

Check if this satisfies the original condition.

Original number in base10: abc=227

In base9: bc a = 2 7 2 in base9.

Convert 272 base9 to base10: 2*81 +7*9 +2=162 +63 +2=227. Yes, that matches.

Cool, so this is a valid solution.

Let me check the rest just in case there are multiple solutions.

3. (b,a)=(3,7):

99*7=71*3 +8c

Compute LHS: 693

RHS:213 +8c

So, 693 -213=480=8c

Thus, c=480/8=60.

Again, c=60>8, invalid.

4. (b,a)=(4,4):

99*4=71*4 +8c

Compute LHS:396

RHS:284 +8c

So, 396 -284=112=8c

c=112/8=14. Again, c=14>8, invalid.

5. (b,a)=(5,1):

99*1=71*5 +8c

Compute LHS:99

RHS:355 +8c

So, 99 -355= -256=8c

c=-256/8=-32. Negative, invalid.

6. (b,a)=(6,6):

99*6=71*6 +8c

Compute LHS:594

RHS:426 +8c

So, 594 -426=168=8c

c=168/8=21. Still too big, invalid.

7. (b,a)=(7,3):

99*3=71*7 +8c

Compute LHS:297

RHS:497 +8c

So, 297 -497= -200=8c

c=-200/8=-25. Negative, invalid.

8. (b,a)=(8,invalid): already excluded.

So, among all possible (b,a) pairs, only (2,2) gave a valid c=7.

Thus, the only solution is a=2, b=2, c=7.

Therefore, the three-digit number is 227 in base10, which is 272 in base9.

Double-checking: 227 in base10 is indeed 2*100 +2*10 +7=227.

In base9, 272 is 2*81 +7*9 +2=162+63+2=227.

Yep, that's correct.

I don't think there are any other solutions because all the other (b,a) pairs either led to c being out of range or negative. So, 227 is the unique solution.

**Final Answer**
The three-digit number is \boxed{227}.
</think>

To find the three-digit positive integer $\underline{a}\underline{b}\underline{c}$ in base 10, which is represented as $\underline{b}\underline{c}\underline{a}$ in base nine, we start by translating both representations into base 10 equations.

The number $\underline{a}\underline{b}\underline{c}$ in base 10 is:
\[ 100a + 10b + c \]

The number $\underline{b}\underline{c}\underline{a}$ in base nine translates to:
\[ 81b + 9c + a \]

Equating these two expressions, we get:
\[ 100a + 10b + c = 81b + 9c + a \]

Rearranging and simplifying the equation:
\[ 99a + 10b + c = 81b + 9c \]
\[ 99a - 71b - 8c = 0 \]

This can be rewritten as:
\[ 99a = 71b + 8c \]

Considering the constraints that $a, b, c$ are digits (0-9 for base 10, 0-8 for base 9), we analyze the equation modulo 8:
\[ 99a \equiv 71b + 8c \pmod{8} \]
\[ 3a \equiv 7b \pmod{8} \]

This simplifies to:
\[ a \equiv 5b \pmod{8} \]

We find possible values of $a$ and $b$ that satisfy this congruence:
- $b = 1 \Rightarrow a = 5$
- $b = 2 \Rightarrow a = 2$
- $b = 3 \Rightarrow a = 7$
- $b = 4 \Rightarrow a = 4$
- $b = 5 \Rightarrow a = 1$
- $b = 6 \Rightarrow a = 6$
- $b = 7 \Rightarrow a = 3$

Testing these pairs in the equation $99a = 71b + 8c$:
- Only $(b, a) = (2, 2)$ results in a valid $c = 7$.

Thus, the three-digit number is $\underline{a}\underline{b}\underline{c} = 227$, which converts to $\underline{b}\underline{c}\underline{a}$ in base nine as 272. Both conversions confirm the solution.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{227}
\]
