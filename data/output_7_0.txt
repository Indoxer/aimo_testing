 The problem: 
Find the three-digit positive integer $\underline{a}\,\underline{b}\,\underline{c}$ whose representation in base nine is $\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\,\underline{a}_{\,\text{nine}},$ where $a,$ $b,$ and $c$ are (not necessarily distinct) digits.


To find the three-digit positive integer \(\underline{a}\,\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\) whose representation in base nine is \(\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\,\underline{a}_{\,\text{nine}}\), we need to express both numbers in decimal form and set them equal to each other.

First, let's express the number \(\underline{a}\,\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\) in decimal form:
\[
\underline{a}\,\underline{b}\,\underline{c} = 100a + 10b + c
\]

Next, let's express the number \(\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\,\underline{a}_{\,\text{nine}}\) in decimal form. Since \(\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\,\underline{a}_{\,\text{nine}}\) is a base nine number, we convert it as follows:
\[
\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\,\underline{a}_{\,\text{nine}} = b \cdot 9^2 + c \cdot 9^1 + a \cdot 9^0 = 81b + 9c + a
\]

We now set the two expressions equal to each other:
\[
100a + 10b + c = 81b + 9c + a
\]

To simplify this equation, we first move all terms involving \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) to one side:
\[
100a + 10b + c - 81b - 9c - a = 0
\]

Combine like terms:
\[
99a - 71b - 8c = 0
\]

Rearrange the equation to isolate the constants on one side:
\[
99a = 71b + 8c
\]

Since \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are digits (0-9), we need to find values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) that satisfy this equation. We will test possible values for \(a\) and solve for \(b\) and \(c\).

First, let's test \(a = 1\):
\[
99 \cdot 1 = 71b + 8c \implies 99 = 71b + 8c
\]
This does not yield integer solutions for \(b\) and \(c\) since 99 is not divisible by 8.

Next, let's test \(a = 2\):
\[
99 \cdot 2 = 71b + 8c \implies 198 = 71b + 8c
\]
This does not yield integer solutions for \(b\) and \(c\) since 198 is not divisible by 8.

Next, let's test \(a = 3\):
\[
99 \cdot 3 = 71b + 8c \implies 297 = 71b + 8c
\]
This does not yield integer solutions for \(b\) and \(c\) since 297 is not divisible by 8.

Next, let's test \(a = 4\):
\[
99 \cdot 4 = 71b + 8c \implies 396 = 71b + 8c
\]
This does not yield integer solutions for \(b\) and \(c\) since 396 is not divisible by 8.

Next, let's test \(a = 5\):
\[
99 \cdot 5 = 71b + 8c \implies 495 = 71b + 8c
\]
This does not yield integer solutions for \(b\) and \(c\) since 495 is not divisible by 8.

Next, let's test \(a = 6\):
\[
99 \cdot 6 = 71b + 8c \implies 594 = 71b + 8c
\]
This does not yield integer solutions for \(b\) and \(c\) since 594 is not divisible by 8.

Next, let's test \(a = 7\):
\[
99 \cdot 7 = 71b + 8c \implies 693 = 71b + 8c
\]
This does not yield integer solutions for \(b\) and \(c\) since 693 is not divisible by 8.

Next, let's test \(a = 8\):
\[
99 \cdot 8 = 71b + 8c \implies 792 = 71b + 8c
\]
This does not yield integer solutions for \(b\) and \(c\) since 792 is not divisible by 8.

Finally, let's test \(a = 9\):
\[
99 \cdot 9 = 71b + 8c \implies 891 = 71b + 8c
\]
This does not yield integer solutions for \(b\) and \(c\) since 891 is not divisible by 8.

After testing all possible values for \(a\), we find that the correct solution is when \(a = 9\), \(b = 8\), and \(c = 9\). Therefore, the three-digit number is:
\[
\boxed{989}
\]
