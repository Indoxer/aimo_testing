 The problem: 
Find the three-digit positive integer $\underline{a}\,\underline{b}\,\underline{c}$ whose representation in base nine is $\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\,\underline{a}_{\,\text{nine}},$ where $a,$ $b,$ and $c$ are (not necessarily distinct) digits.


To solve the problem, we need to find a three-digit number \(\underline{a}\,\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\) such that its representation in base nine is \(\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\,\underline{a}_{\,\text{nine}}\). This means that the number \(\underline{a}\,\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\) in decimal is equal to the number \(\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\,\underline{a}_{\,\text{nine}}\) in decimal.

First, let's express the number \(\underline{a}\,\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\) in decimal form:
\[ \underline{a}\,\underline{b}\,\underline{c} = 100a + 10b + c. \]

Next, let's express the number \(\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\,\underline{a}_{\,\text{nine}}\) in decimal form. Since \(\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\,\underline{a}_{\,\text{nine}}\) is a number in base nine, it can be written as:
\[ \underline{b}\,\underline{c}\,\underline{a}_{\,\text{nine}} = 81b + 9c + a. \]

We are given that these two expressions are equal:
\[ 100a + 10b + c = 81b + 9c + a. \]

Rearranging the terms, we get:
\[ 100a + 10b + c - a - 81b - 9c = 0, \]
\[ 99a - 71b - 8c = 0. \]

This simplifies to:
\[ 99a = 71b + 8c. \]

Since \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are digits (i.e., integers between 0 and 8 for \(b\) and \(c\) and 1 and 9 for \(a\)), we need to find values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) that satisfy this equation. Let's test possible values for \(a\).

If \(a = 8\):
\[ 99 \cdot 8 = 71b + 8c, \]
\[ 792 = 71b + 8c. \]
We need to find integer values of \(b\) and \(c\) that satisfy this equation. Let's test \(b = 8\):
\[ 792 = 71 \cdot 8 + 8c, \]
\[ 792 = 568 + 8c, \]
\[ 224 = 8c, \]
\[ c = 28. \]
Since \(c = 28\) is not a valid digit (it must be between 0 and 8), \(b = 8\) is not a solution.

Let's test \(b = 7\):
\[ 792 = 71 \cdot 7 + 8c, \]
\[ 792 = 497 + 8c, \]
\[ 295 = 8c, \]
\[ c = 36.5. \]
Since \(c = 36.5\) is not a valid digit, \(b = 7\) is not a solution.

Let's test \(b = 6\):
\[ 792 = 71 \cdot 6 + 8c, \]
\[ 792 = 426 + 8c, \]
\[ 366 = 8c, \]
\[ c = 45.75. \]
Since \(c = 45.75\) is not a valid digit, \(b = 6\) is not a solution.

Let's test \(b = 5\):
\[ 792 = 71 \cdot 5 + 8c, \]
\[ 792 = 355 + 8c, \]
\[ 437 = 8c, \]
\[ c = 54.625. \]
Since \(c = 54.625\) is not a valid digit, \(b = 5\) is not a solution.

Let's test \(b = 4\):
\[ 792 = 71 \cdot 4 + 8c, \]
\[ 792 = 284 + 8c, \]
\[ 508 = 8c, \]
\[ c = 63.5. \]
Since \(c = 63.5\) is not a valid digit, \(b = 4\) is not a solution.

Let's test \(b = 3\):
\[ 792 = 71 \cdot 3 + 8c, \]
\[ 792 = 213 + 8c, \]
\[ 579 = 8c, \]
\[ c = 72.375. \]
Since \(c = 72.375\) is not a valid digit, \(b = 3\) is not a solution.

Let's test \(b = 2\):
\[ 792 = 71 \cdot 2 + 8c, \]
\[ 792 = 142 + 8c, \]
\[ 650 = 8c, \]
\[ c = 81.25. \]
Since \(c = 81.25\) is not a valid digit, \(b = 2\) is not a solution.

Let's test \(b = 1\):
\[ 792 = 71 \cdot 1 + 8c, \]
\[ 792 = 71 + 8c, \]
\[ 721 = 8c, \]
\[ c = 90.125. \]
Since \(c = 90.125\) is not a valid digit, \(b = 1\) is not a solution.

Let's test \(b = 0\):
\[ 792 = 71 \cdot 0 + 8c, \]
\[ 792 = 8c, \]
\[ c = 99. \]
Since \(c = 99\) is not a valid digit, \(b = 0\) is not a solution.

Finally, let's test \(a = 9\):
\[ 99 \cdot 9 = 71b + 8c, \]
\[ 891 = 71b + 8c. \]
We need to find integer values of \(b\) and \(c\) that satisfy this equation. Let's test \(b = 9\):
\[ 891 = 71 \cdot 9 + 8c, \]
\[ 891 = 639 + 8c, \]
\[ 252 = 8c, \]
\[ c = 31.5. \]
Since \(c = 31.5\) is not a valid digit, \(b = 9\) is not a solution.

Let's test \(b = 8\):
\[ 891 = 71 \cdot 8 + 8c, \]
\[ 891 = 568 + 8c, \]
\[ 323 = 8c, \]
\[ c = 40.375. \]
Since \(c = 40.375\) is not a valid digit, \(b = 8\) is not a solution.

Let's test \(b = 7\):
\[ 891 = 71 \cdot 7 + 8c, \]
\[ 891 = 497 + 8c, \]
\[ 394 = 8c, \]
\[ c = 49.25. \]
Since \(c = 49.25\) is not a valid digit, \(b = 7\) is not a solution.

Let's test \(b = 6\):
\[ 891 = 71 \cdot 6 + 8c, \]
\[ 891 = 426 + 8c, \]
\[ 465 = 8c, \]
\[ c = 58.125. \]
Since \(c = 58.125\) is not a valid digit, \(b = 6\) is not a solution.

Let's test \(b = 5\):
\[ 891 = 71 \cdot 5 + 8c, \]
\[ 891 = 355 + 8c, \]
\[ 536 = 8c, \]
\[ c = 67. \]
Since \(c = 67\) is not a valid digit, \(b = 5\) is not a solution.

Let's test \(b = 4\):
\[ 891 = 71 \cdot 4 + 8c, \]
\[ 891 = 284 + 8c, \]
\[ 607 = 8c, \]
\[ c = 75.875. \
