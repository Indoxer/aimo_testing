 The problem: 
Find the three-digit positive integer $\underline{a}\,\underline{b}\,\underline{c}$ whose representation in base nine is $\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\,\underline{a}_{\,\text{nine}},$ where $a,$ $b,$ and $c$ are (not necessarily distinct) digits.


<think>
Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find a three-digit positive integer, let's call it abc, where a, b, c are digits. The interesting part is that when this number is represented in base nine, it becomes bca_nine. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down.

First off, let's clarify what each notation means. The number abc is a three-digit number in base ten, right? So, in base ten, that would translate to 100*a + 10*b + c. On the other hand, the number bca_nine is a three-digit number in base nine. So, how does that convert to base ten?

Well, in any base, the digits represent powers of that base. So for base nine, the first digit from the right is 9^0, which is 1, the middle digit is 9^1, which is 9, and the leftmost digit is 9^2, which is 81. Therefore, bca_nine in base ten should be equal to b*81 + c*9 + a*1.

So, putting it all together, we can set up an equation because both representations refer to the same number, just in different bases. That is:

100*a + 10*b + c = b*81 + c*9 + a

Alright, let's write that out:

100a + 10b + c = 81b + 9c + a

Hmm, okay, now let's rearrange terms to bring like terms together. Let me subtract the right side from both sides so that everything is on the left:

100a + 10b + c - 81b - 9c - a = 0

Simplify term by term:

- For the a terms: 100a - a = 99a
- For the b terms: 10b - 81b = -71b
- For the c terms: c - 9c = -8c

So combining these, the equation simplifies to:

99a - 71b - 8c = 0

Hmm, so 99a = 71b + 8c

Now, since a, b, c are digits, their possible values are limited. In base ten, they can be from 0 to 9, except that since abc is a three-digit number, a cannot be zero. Similarly, in base nine, the digits b, c, a must be less than 9, because base nine digits go from 0 to 8. Wait, hold on! If the original number is in base nine, then the digits b, c, a must be between 0 and 8. But the number abc is in base ten, so a can be up to 9, but wait, no—the original number is a three-digit positive integer, so a is from 1 to 9, but also, as digits in base nine, b, c, a must be from 0 to 8. Wait, that seems conflicting.

Wait, no, actually, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Because the problem says that the number abc (base ten) is equal to bca_nine. So, while abc is a base ten number, its digits a, b, c must satisfy that when converted to base nine, it becomes bca_nine. Therefore, in the base nine number, each digit (b, c, a) must be valid base nine digits, meaning 0 through 8. However, in the base ten number abc, the digit a is the hundreds place, so a can be from 1 to 9. But if a is also a digit in base nine, it must be from 0 to 8. Therefore, a has to be from 1 to 8.

Similarly, the digits b and c in the base ten number abc can be from 0 to 9, but since they are also digits in the base nine number bca_nine, they must be from 0 to 8. So, altogether, a, b, c are digits from 0 to 8, with a not being zero.

Therefore, our variables a, b, c are integers where 1 ≤ a ≤ 8, and 0 ≤ b, c ≤ 8.

Going back to our equation:

99a = 71b + 8c

We need to find integers a, b, c within those ranges such that this equation holds.

Given that a is between 1 and 8, let's consider possible values for a and see if we can find corresponding b and c.

Let's start with a=1:

99*1 = 99 = 71b + 8c

We need to solve for integers b, c (0 ≤ b, c ≤8):

71b + 8c = 99

Looking at coefficients, 71 is quite large compared to 8, so let's see possible b values. Since 71*1=71, which leaves 99-71=28. Then 28/8=3.5, which is not an integer. So c=3.5 is invalid.

Next, b=0:

71*0 +8c=99 => 8c=99. 99 divided by 8 is 12.375, which is beyond c's maximum of 8. So no solution.

Similarly, b=1: 71+8c=99 => 8c=28 => c=3.5 invalid.

b=2: 142 +8c=99? Wait, no, 71*2=142, which is more than 99, so that's already too big. So no solutions for a=1.

Moving on to a=2:

99*2=198=71b +8c

Looking for 71b +8c=198.

Again, b can't be too large. Let's calculate maximum b: 198 /71≈2.788, so b can be 0,1,2.

b=2: 71*2=142; 198-142=56=8c => c=7. So c=7, which is within 0-8.

So, we found a potential solution: a=2, b=2, c=7.

Let me verify:

In base ten, abc is 227.

In base nine, bca_nine is 2 7 2 base nine.

Convert 272 base nine to base ten:

2*81 +7*9 +2*1=162 +63 +2=227.

Yes, that works!

But let me check if there are more solutions or if this is unique.

Proceeding with a=2, let's check other possible b.

b=1: 71*1=71; 198-71=127=8c. 127/8≈15.875, which is way above 8.

b=0: 8c=198, c=24.75>8. Not acceptable.

So only b=2 gives a valid c=7. So that's the solution for a=2.

But just to make sure, let's check a=3:

99*3=297=71b +8c.

Maximum b: 297 /71≈4.183, so b can be 0,1,2,3,4.

Check b=4: 71*4=284; 297-284=13=8c. 13/8≈1.625, not integer.

b=3: 71*3=213; 297-213=84=8c; 84/8=10.5, too big.

Check b=5: 71*5=355; 396-355=41=8c; 41/8≈5.125, not integer.

b=4: 71*4=284; 396-284=112=8c; 112/8=14, which is more than 8. Invalid.

b=2:142; 396-142=254=8c; 254/8≈31.75, nope.

b=1:71; 396-71=325=8c; 325/8≈40.625, nope.

b=2:142; 495-142=353=8c; 353/8≈44.125, nope.

b=1:71; 495-71=424=8c; 424/8=53, which is way higher than 8.

b=0:8c=495; c≈61.875, nope.

No solutions for a=5.

a=6:

99*6=594=71b +8c.

Max b:594/71≈8.366, so b can be up to 8.

Check b=8:71*8=568; 594-568=26=8c; c=26/8=3.25, not integer.

b=7:71*7=497; 594-497=97=8c; 97/8≈12.125, too big.

b=1:71; 594-71=523=8c; 523/8≈65.375, nope.

b=0:8c=594; c=74.25, nope.

No solutions for a=6.

a=7:

99*7=693=71b +8c.

Max b:693/71≈9.76, but b must be ≤8.

So b can be from 0 to8.

Check b=8:71*8=568; 693-568=125=8c; c=125/8≈15.625, too big.

b=7:497; 693-497=196=8c; 196/8=24.5, nope.

b=6:426; 693-426=267=8c; 267/8≈33.375, nope.

b=4:284; 693-284=409=8c; 409/8≈51.125, nope.

b=3:213; 693-213=480=8c; 480/8=60, which is too high.

b=2:142; 693-142=551=8c; 551/8≈68.875, nope.

No solutions for a=7.

a=8:

99*8=792=71b +8c.

Max b:792/71≈11.15, but b must be ≤8.

So, check b=8:71*8=568; 792-568=224=8c; 224/8=28, which is too big.

b=7:497; 792-497=295=8c; 295/8≈36.875, nope.

b=6:426; 792-426=366=8c; 366/8=45.75, nope.

b=5:355; 792-355=437=8c; 437/8≈54.625, nope.

b=4:284; 792-284=508=8c; 508/8=63.5, nope.

b=3:213; 792-213=579=8c; 579/8≈72.375, nope.

b=2:142; 792-142=650=8c; 650/8=81.25, nope.

b=1:71; 792-71=721=8c; 721/8≈90.125, nope.

b=0:8c=792; c=99, way too big.

No solutions for a=8.

So, after checking all possible a from 1 to8, the only solution is when a=2, b=2, c=7.

Just to double-check, let's confirm that 227 in base ten is equal to 272 in base nine.

Calculating 272 in base nine:

Starting from the right, the digits represent 9^0, 9^1, 9^2.

So, 2*9^2 + 7*9^1 + 2*9^0 = 2*81 + 7*9 + 2*1 = 162 + 63 + 2 = 227.

Yes, that matches. So the number is indeed 227.

I don't think there are other solutions because when I checked all possible a from 1 to8, none of them gave a valid integer c within 0-8 except for a=2, which gave c=7.

So, the three-digit number is 227.

**Final Answer**
The three-digit number is \boxed{227}.
</think>

To find the three-digit positive integer $\underline{a}\underline{b}\underline{c}$ whose representation in base nine is $\underline{b}\underline{c}\underline{a}_{\text{nine}}$, we start by setting up the equation relating the base ten and base nine representations.

The base ten number $abc$ can be expressed as:
\[ 100a + 10b + c \]

The base nine number $bca_{\text{nine}}$ can be expressed as:
\[ b \cdot 81 + c \cdot 9 + a \]

Equating these two expressions, we get:
\[ 100a + 10b + c = 81b + 9c + a \]

Rearranging terms, we obtain:
\[ 99a - 71b - 8c = 0 \]

This simplifies to:
\[ 99a = 71b + 8c \]

Given that $a, b, c$ are digits (0-8 for base nine, and 1-8 for $a$), we test values for $a$ from 1 to 8 to find suitable $b$ and $c$.

Testing $a = 2$:
\[ 99 \cdot 2 = 198 \]
\[ 71b + 8c = 198 \]

Testing possible values for $b$:
- For $b = 2$: 
  \[ 71 \cdot 2 = 142 \]
  \[ 198 - 142 = 56 \]
  \[ 8c = 56 \implies c = 7 \]

Thus, $a = 2$, $b = 2$, and $c = 7$ satisfy the equation. Verifying, the base ten number 227 converts to base nine as follows:
\[ 2 \cdot 81 + 7 \cdot 9 + 2 = 162 + 63 + 2 = 227 \]

Therefore, the three-digit number is:
\[
\boxed{227}
\]
