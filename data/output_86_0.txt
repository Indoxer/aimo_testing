 The problem: 
Alice chooses a set $A$ of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets $B$ of positive integers with the property that the maximum element of $B$ belongs to $A$. Bob's list has 2024 sets. Find the sum of the elements of A.


<think>
Okay, so Alice picks a set A of positive integers. Then Bob makes a list of all finite nonempty sets B where the maximum element in B is in A. And Bob ends up listing exactly 2024 such sets. We need to find the sum of the elements of A.

Hmm, let me try to understand what this means. So, for each element in A, we can consider how many sets B have that element as their maximum. If A has elements a1, a2, ..., an, then each ai contributes some number of sets to Bob's list. Since these sets are counted without overlap (because each set has a unique maximum), the total number of sets is just the sum of the contributions from each element in A.

So, if I denote the number of sets with maximum ai as N(ai), then the total number of sets Bob lists is N(a1) + N(a2) + ... + N(an) = 2024.

Now, what is N(ai)? For a given ai, how many finite nonempty sets B have ai as their maximum? Well, any such set B must contain ai and can contain any subset of the numbers less than ai. So, the number of possible subsets of {1, 2, ..., ai-1} is 2^{ai - 1}. But since the set B must be nonempty and include ai, we don't subtract anything because the empty set isn't considered here. Wait, actually, no. The subsets can be empty, but when you take the union with {ai}, you get a non-empty set because {ai} itself is included. So, the number of sets B with maximum ai is indeed 2^{ai - 1}.

Therefore, for each ai, N(ai) = 2^{ai - 1}. So, the total number of sets is the sum over all ai in A of 2^{ai - 1} equals 2024.

So, mathematically, we can write:

Σ_{a ∈ A} 2^{a - 1} = 2024.

Our goal is to find the sum of the elements of A, which would be Σ_{a ∈ A} a.

So, now we need to figure out what A is such that the sum of 2^{a - 1} over all a in A is 2024. Once we know A, we can compute the sum.

First, perhaps it's helpful to factorize 2024 to see if that gives us any clues about the exponents. Let's do that.

2024 divided by 2 is 1012.

1012 divided by 2 is 506.

506 divided by 2 is 253.

253 is divisible by 11? Let's check: 11 times 23 is 253, yes, because 11*20=220, 11*23=253.

So, 2024 factors into 2^3 * 11 * 23.

Wait, but in terms of powers of 2, 2024 is 8 * 253, right? Because 2^3 is 8, and 8*253 is 2024.

But 253 is not a power of 2, so maybe that's a hint.

Alternatively, perhaps looking at binary representations could help because we're dealing with sums of powers of 2. Maybe the number 2024 in binary is something that can tell us how many terms we have in the sum.

Let me convert 2024 into binary.

We can divide 2024 by 2 repeatedly:

2024 /2 =1012 rem 0

1012 /2=506 rem 0

506 /2=253 rem 0

253 /2=126 rem 1

126 /2=63 rem 0

63 /2=31 rem 1

31 /2=15 rem 1

15 /2=7 rem 1

7 /2=3 rem 1

3 /2=1 rem 1

1 /2=0 rem 1

So writing the remainders from last to first: 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0

Wait, let me count: starting from the bottom:

The first division gave remainder 0, then 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1.

Wait, perhaps my method was wrong. Let me recount.

Alternatively, 2024 in decimal to binary:

We can note that 2^10 is 1024, so 2^11 is 2048, which is larger than 2024.

So, the highest power of 2 less than 2024 is 1024 (2^10).

Subtracting 1024 from 2024 leaves 992.

Next, 512 (2^9) is next. 992 - 512 = 480.

Then 256 (2^8): 480 - 256 = 224.

Then 128 (2^7): 224 - 128 = 96.

Then 64 (2^6): 96 - 64 = 32.

Then 32 (2^5): 32 - 32 = 0.

So, the exponents are 10,9,8,7,6,5.

Thus, 2024 = 2^10 + 2^9 + 2^8 + 2^7 + 2^6 + 2^5.

Which is 1024 + 512 + 256 + 128 + 64 + 32 = 2024.

So, 2024 in binary is 1 followed by six 1s and then five 0s? Wait, no, wait, hold on.

Wait, 2^10 is 1024, so positions go from 0 upwards.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of bits.

Wait, 2024 is equal to 2^10 + 2^9 + 2^8 + 2^7 + 2^6 + 2^5, so its binary representation is a 1 followed by 10 bits where bits 5 through 10 are 1s.

Wait, let's see:

Positions: 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0

Bits:        1  1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0

Wait, no. Wait, 2^10 is position 10, so the leftmost bit is position 10, and the rightmost is position 0.

So, 2^10: bit 10 is 1,

2^9: bit 9 is 1,

2^8: bit 8 is 1,

2^7: bit 7 is 1,

2^6: bit 6 is 1,

2^5: bit 5 is 1,

and bits 4,3,2,1,0 are 0.

So, binary representation is 11111100000.

So, 2024 in binary is 11111100000.

That's 6 ones followed by 5 zeros.

Hmm, interesting.

So, going back, since we have Σ_{a ∈ A} 2^{a - 1} = 2024 = 2^10 + 2^9 + 2^8 + 2^7 + 2^6 + 2^5.

So, if we think about each term 2^{a - 1} as being a separate power of 2, the sum is equal to the sum of several distinct powers of 2.

In our case, 2024 is already expressed as the sum of consecutive powers of 2 from 2^5 to 2^10. So, that suggests that each exponent a -1 corresponds to the exponents in the binary representation.

Wait, so each 2^{a - 1} is a distinct power of 2, so in order for their sum to be 2024, which is itself a sum of distinct powers of 2, A must be the set {5+1, 6+1, ..., 10+1}, i.e., {6,7,8,9,10,11}. Because 2^{a -1} = 2^5, 2^6, ..., 2^10, so a -1 is 5,6,...,10, meaning a is 6,7,...,11.

Therefore, A = {6,7,8,9,10,11}.

Hence, the sum of the elements of A is 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11.

Calculating that:

6 + 7 = 13,

13 + 8 = 21,

21 + 9 = 30,

30 + 10 = 40,

40 + 11 = 51.

So, the sum is 51.

Wait, let me confirm that. Alternatively, since it's an arithmetic sequence from 6 to 11 inclusive.

Number of terms: 11 - 6 + 1 = 6 terms.

Sum is (first term + last term)/2 * number of terms = (6 + 11)/2 * 6 = (17/2)*6 = 17*3 = 51.

Yes, same result.

But let me double-check whether A must necessarily be {6,7,8,9,10,11} or if there could be another set that also sums to 2024.

Is 2024 expressible as a sum of other powers of 2?

Well, 2024 is 2^10 + 2^9 + 2^8 + 2^7 + 2^6 + 2^5, which is 64 + 32 + 16 + 8 + 4 + 2, but wait, no, that's not correct.

Wait, 2^10 is 1024, 2^9 is 512, 2^8 is 256, 2^7 is 128, 2^6 is 64, 2^5 is 32.

So 1024 + 512 is 1536, plus 256 is 1792, plus 128 is 1920, plus 64 is 1984, plus 32 is 2016, wait, that's 2016, not 2024.

Wait, did I make a mistake earlier?

Wait, 2^10 is 1024, 2^9 is 512, 2^8 is 256, 2^7 is 128, 2^6 is 64, 2^5 is 32. Adding those together:

1024 + 512 = 1536,

1536 + 256 = 1792,

1792 + 128 = 1920,

1920 + 64 = 1984,

1984 + 32 = 2016.

Wait, that's only 2016, not 2024. So, where is the rest?

Ah, right, 2024 - 2016 = 8. So, 2024 is 2016 + 8, which is 2^10 + 2^9 + 2^8 + 2^7 + 2^6 + 2^5 + 2^3.

So, 2^3 is 8, so adding that in.

So, 2024 is 2^10 + 2^9 + 2^8 + 2^7 + 2^6 + 2^5 + 2^3.

Therefore, the binary representation should have 1s at positions 3,5,6,7,8,9,10.

So, that would correspond to exponents a -1 = 3,5,6,7,8,9,10, so a = 4,6,7,8,9,10,11.

Wait, so A would be {4,6,7,8,9,10,11}.

But hold on, does that mean A is {4,6,7,8,9,10,11}? Is that correct?

Because then 2^{a -1} would be 2^3, 2^5, 2^6, 2^7, 2^8, 2^9, 2^10.

Adding those up: 8 + 32 + 64 + 128 + 256 + 512 + 1024.

Calculating:

8 + 32 = 40,

40 + 64 = 104,

104 + 128 = 232,

232 + 256 = 488,

488 + 512 = 1000,

1000 + 1024 = 2024.

Yes, that adds up correctly.

So, then A can be either {6,7,8,9,10,11} or {4,6,7,8,9,10,11}?

Wait, no. Wait, if a -1 is 3,5,6,7,8,9,10, then a is 4,6,7,8,9,10,11. So, A is {4,6,7,8,9,10,11}.

But why did I initially think that A was {6,7,8,9,10,11}? Because I thought 2024 was just 2^10 + ... + 2^5, but actually, it's 2^10 + ... + 2^5 plus 2^3.

So, that changes things.

Wait, so depending on whether A includes 4 or not, the sum of 2^{a -1} will be different.

If A is {6,7,8,9,10,11}, then the sum is 2^5 + 2^6 + ... + 2^10 = 2^5*(2^6 -1) = 32*(64 -1)=32*63=2016. But that's only 2016, not 2024.

So, to get 2024, we need an extra 8, which is 2^3.

So, if A also includes 4, so that 2^{4 -1}=2^3=8 is added, making the total sum 2016 + 8 = 2024.

Therefore, A must be {4,6,7,8,9,10,11}.

Wait, so earlier reasoning was incorrect because I thought 2024 was just the sum from 2^5 to 2^10, but actually, it's more complicated.

So, the key is that 2024 in binary is 11111100000, but that corresponds to the sum of 2^10 down to 2^5, which is 2016, not 2024. Therefore, to get 2024, we need another term, which is 2^3.

So, in terms of exponents a -1, that is 3, hence a = 4.

Therefore, A must include 4 as well.

So, A is {4,6,7,8,9,10,11}.

So, the sum of the elements of A is 4 + 6 +7 +8 +9 +10 +11.

Calculating that:

4 + 6 = 10,

10 +7 = 17,

17 +8=25,

25 +9=34,

34 +10=44,

44 +11=55.

So, the sum is 55.

Wait, but hang on a second. Let me verify.

Compute the sum of the elements of A: 4 + 6 +7 +8 +9 +10 +11.

4 +6=10, 10+7=17, 17+8=25, 25+9=34, 34+10=44, 44+11=55.

Yes, 55.

Alternatively, since A is {4,6,7,8,9,10,11}, which is 4 and then 6 through 11 inclusive.

So, 6 through 11 is 6,7,8,9,10,11, which is 6 numbers, sum is (6+11)*6/2=17*3=51, plus 4 gives 55.

So, that seems consistent.

But now, why did I get confused earlier? Because when I converted 2024 to binary, I thought it was 11111100000, which is 2016, but actually, 2024 - 2016 is 8, which is 2^3.

Therefore, the exponents a -1 in the sum Σ2^{a-1} must include 3, so a is 4.

Therefore, A is {4,6,7,8,9,10,11}, summing to 55.

But wait, another way to look at it is that 2024 is equal to 2016 + 8, which is 2^10 + 2^9 + 2^8 + 2^7 + 2^6 + 2^5 + 2^3.

So, the exponents a -1 are 10,9,8,7,6,5,3, so a are 11,10,9,8,7,6,4.

So, arranging them in ascending order: 4,6,7,8,9,10,11.

So, that's A.

Hence, the sum is 4 +6 +7 +8 +9 +10 +11 =55.

So, the answer is 55.

But let me check again.

Is there another possibility? Could A have more elements or different elements?

Suppose A had two copies of 4, but since A is a set, duplicates aren't allowed. So, A must consist of unique elements.

So, if we have Σ2^{a -1}=2024, and 2024 in binary is 11111100000, which is 2016, but we need 2024, so we need to add 8, which is 2^3.

Therefore, A must include 4, and the rest are 6,7,8,9,10,11.

So, yeah, that seems to be the only way.

Therefore, the sum is 55.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{55}
</think>

Alice chooses a set \( A \) of positive integers. Bob lists all finite nonempty sets \( B \) where the maximum element of \( B \) belongs to \( A \). Bob's list has 2024 sets. We need to find the sum of the elements of \( A \).

For each element \( a \in A \), the number of sets \( B \) with maximum element \( a \) is \( 2^{a-1} \). Therefore, the total number of sets Bob lists is given by:

\[
\sum_{a \in A} 2^{a-1} = 2024
\]

We need to factorize 2024 and express it as a sum of powers of 2. Converting 2024 into binary, we find:

\[
2024 = 11111100000_2
\]

This represents the sum of powers of 2 from \( 2^3 \) to \( 2^{10} \). However, we need to account for the exact value 2024, which is 2016 (sum of \( 2^5 \) to \( 2^{10} \)) plus 8 (\( 2^3 \)). Thus, the exponents \( a - 1 \) correspond to 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10, leading to \( a \) values of 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11.

The set \( A \) is therefore \( \{4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11\} \). Summing these elements:

\[
4 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 = 55
\]

Thus, the sum of the elements of \( A \) is:

\[
\boxed{55}
\]
