 The problem: 
Let $S$ be the set of all rational numbers that can be expressed as a repeating decimal in the form $0.\overline{abcd},$ where at least one of the digits $a,$ $b,$ $c,$ or $d$ is nonzero. Let $N$ be the number of distinct numerators obtained when numbers in $S$ are written as fractions in lowest terms. For example, both $4$ and $410$ are counted among the distinct numerators for numbers in $S$ because $0.\overline{3636} = \frac{4}{11}$ and $0.\overline{1230} = \frac{410}{3333}.$ Find the remainder when $N$ is divided by $1000.$


To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of distinct numerators when rational numbers in the form \(0.\overline{abcd}\) are expressed as fractions in lowest terms. A number in the form \(0.\overline{abcd}\) can be written as a fraction \(\frac{n}{9999}\), where \(n\) is an integer between 0 and 9999 (inclusive), and at least one of the digits \(a, b, c, d\) is nonzero.

First, we note that the fraction \(\frac{n}{9999}\) can be simplified if \(n\) and 9999 have a common factor greater than 1. The prime factorization of 9999 is:
\[9999 = 3^2 \times 11 \times 101.\]
Thus, the fraction \(\frac{n}{9999}\) will be in its lowest terms if and only if \(n\) is not divisible by 3, 11, or 101.

We will use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to count the number of integers from 0 to 9999 that are divisible by 3, 11, or 101, and then subtract this from 9999 to get the number of integers that are not divisible by any of these primes.

The number of integers from 0 to 9999 that are divisible by 3 is:
\[\left\lfloor \frac{9999}{3} \right\rfloor = 3333.\]
The number of integers from 0 to 9999 that are divisible by 11 is:
\[\left\lfloor \frac{9999}{11} \right\rfloor = 909.\]
The number of integers from 0 to 9999 that are divisible by 101 is:
\[\left\lfloor \frac{9999}{101} \right\rfloor = 99.\]
The number of integers from 0 to 9999 that are divisible by both 3 and 11 (i.e., by 33) is:
\[\left\lfloor \frac{9999}{33} \right\rfloor = 303.\]
The number of integers from 0 to 9999 that are divisible by both 3 and 101 (i.e., by 303) is:
\[\left\lfloor \frac{9999}{303} \right\rfloor = 33.\]
The number of integers from 0 to 9999 that are divisible by both 11 and 101 (i.e., by 1111) is:
\[\left\lfloor \frac{9999}{1111} \right\rfloor = 9.\]
The number of integers from 0 to 9999 that are divisible by 3, 11, and 101 (i.e., by 3333) is:
\[\left\lfloor \frac{9999}{3333} \right\rfloor = 3.\]

Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, the number of integers from 0 to 9999 that are divisible by 3, 11, or 101 is:
\[3333 + 909 + 99 - 303 - 33 - 9 + 3 = 3996.\]
Therefore, the number of integers from 0 to 9999 that are not divisible by 3, 11, or 101 is:
\[9999 - 3996 = 6003.\]
This is the number of distinct numerators when the fractions are in their lowest terms.

Finally, we need to find the remainder when 6003 is divided by 1000:
\[6003 \mod 1000 = 3.\]
Thus, the remainder when \(N\) is divided by 1000 is:
\[\boxed{3}.\]
