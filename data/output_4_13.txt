 The problem: 
Let $S$ be the set of all rational numbers that can be expressed as a repeating decimal in the form $0.\overline{abcd},$ where at least one of the digits $a,$ $b,$ $c,$ or $d$ is nonzero. Let $N$ be the number of distinct numerators obtained when numbers in $S$ are written as fractions in lowest terms. For example, both $4$ and $410$ are counted among the distinct numerators for numbers in $S$ because $0.\overline{3636} = \frac{4}{11}$ and $0.\overline{1230} = \frac{410}{3333}.$ Find the remainder when $N$ is divided by $1000.$


To solve this problem, we need to understand the structure of the repeating decimals of the form \(0.\overline{abcd}\). A repeating decimal of this form can be expressed as a fraction:

\[0.\overline{abcd} = \frac{abcd}{9999},\]
where \(abcd\) represents the four-digit number formed by the digits \(a, b, c,\) and \(d\). This fraction can be simplified to its lowest terms by dividing the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor (gcd).

The key is to determine how many distinct numerators can be obtained after simplifying these fractions. This requires understanding the gcd of \(abcd\) and 9999. Since 9999 factors as \(9999 = 3^2 \times 11 \times 101\), the gcd of \(abcd\) and 9999 will be a divisor of 9999. We need to count the distinct numerators obtained after simplification.

The number of distinct numerators is equivalent to the number of integers from 1 to 9999 that are relatively prime to 9999. This is given by Euler's totient function \(\phi(9999)\):

\[
\phi(9999) = 9999 \left(1 - \frac{1}{3}\right) \left(1 - \frac{1}{11}\right) \left(1 - \frac{1}{101}\right) = 9999 \cdot \frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{10}{11} \cdot \frac{100}{101} = 6000.
\]

Therefore, the number of distinct numerators obtained when numbers in \(S\) are written as fractions in lowest terms is 6000. The remainder when 6000 is divided by 1000 is:

\[
\boxed{000}.
