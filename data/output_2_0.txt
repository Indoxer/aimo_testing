 The problem: 
Let $ABCD$ be a parallelogram with $\angle BAD < 90^\circ.$ A circle tangent to sides $\overline{DA},$ $\overline{AB},$ and $\overline{BC}$ intersects diagonal $\overline{AC}$ at points $P$ and $Q$ with $AP < AQ,$ as shown. Suppose that $AP=3,$ $PQ=9,$ and $QC=16.$ Then the area of $ABCD$ can be expressed in the form $m\sqrt{n},$ where $m$ and $n$ are positive integers, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n.$


To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the given information about the parallelogram \(ABCD\) and the circle tangent to its sides. Let's denote the center of the circle as \(O\) and its radius as \(r\). Since the circle is tangent to sides \(DA\), \(AB\), and \(BC\), it is an excircle relative to side \(DC\).

First, we note that the circle is tangent to \(DA\) at point \(D\), to \(AB\) at point \(B\), and to \(BC\) at point \(C\). This implies that the tangents from a point to a circle are equal in length. Therefore, if the circle is tangent to \(DA\) at \(D\), to \(AB\) at \(B\), and to \(BC\) at \(C\), then the lengths of the tangents from \(A\) to the points of tangency on \(DA\) and \(AB\) are equal, and the lengths of the tangents from \(C\) to the points of tangency on \(BC\) and \(CD\) are equal.

Given that \(AP = 3\), \(PQ = 9\), and \(QC = 16\), we can determine the total length of diagonal \(AC\):
\[
AC = AP + PQ + QC = 3 + 9 + 16 = 28.
\]

Next, we use the fact that the circle is tangent to the sides of the parallelogram. The tangents from \(A\) to the points of tangency on \(DA\) and \(AB\) are equal, so let the length of these tangents be \(x\). Similarly, the tangents from \(C\) to the points of tangency on \(BC\) and \(CD\) are equal, so let the length of these tangents be \(y\). Therefore, we have:
\[
AD = x + r \quad \text{and} \quad AB = x + r,
\]
\[
BC = y + r \quad \text{and} \quad CD = y + r.
\]

Since \(ABCD\) is a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal, so:
\[
AD = BC \quad \text{and} \quad AB = CD.
\]

Thus, we have:
\[
x + r = y + r \implies x = y.
\]

This implies that the tangents from \(A\) and \(C\) to the points of tangency on \(DA\) and \(BC\) are equal. Now, we use the fact that the circle is tangent to the sides of the parallelogram and the properties of the tangents to find the area of the parallelogram.

The area of a parallelogram can be found using the formula:
\[
\text{Area} = ab \sin \theta,
\]
where \(a\) and \(b\) are the lengths of adjacent sides, and \(\theta\) is the angle between them.

In this case, the sides \(AD\) and \(AB\) are equal, and the angle between them is \(\angle BAD\). We need to find the lengths of \(AD\) and \(AB\) and the angle \(\angle BAD\).

Using the given lengths of the tangents and the properties of the circle, we can set up the following equations:
\[
AD = x + r = 3 + 9 = 12,
\]
\[
AB = x + r = 3 + 9 = 12.
\]

Thus, the lengths of the sides \(AD\) and \(AB\) are both 12. The angle \(\angle BAD\) can be found using the fact that the circle is tangent to the sides of the parallelogram and the properties of the tangents. However, we can use the fact that the area of the parallelogram can also be found using the formula for the area of a triangle formed by the diagonals and the sides.

The area of the parallelogram is:
\[
\text{Area} = 2 \times \text{Area of } \triangle ABC.
\]

Using the given lengths of the tangents and the properties of the circle, we can find the area of \(\triangle ABC\) using the formula for the area of a triangle:
\[
\text{Area of } \triangle ABC = \frac{1}{2} \times AC \times r \times \sin \theta.
\]

Since the area of the parallelogram is twice the area of \(\triangle ABC\), we have:
\[
\text{Area of } ABCD = 2 \times \left( \frac{1}{2} \times 28 \times 9 \times \sin 60^\circ \right) = 2 \times \left( \frac{1}{2} \times 28 \times 9 \times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \right) = 2 \times 63\sqrt{3} = 126\sqrt{3}.
\]

Thus, the area of the parallelogram \(ABCD\) is:
\[
\boxed{216}.
\] 

Therefore, the value of \(m+n\) is:
\[
\boxed{216}.
\] 

The final answer is:
\boxed{216}. \] 

The area of the parallelogram \(ABCD\) is \(\boxed{216}\). The value of \(m+n\) is \(\boxed{216}\). The final answer is \(\boxed{216}\). \]
