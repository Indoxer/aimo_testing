 The problem: 
Let $ABCD$ be a parallelogram with $\angle BAD < 90^\circ.$ A circle tangent to sides $\overline{DA},$ $\overline{AB},$ and $\overline{BC}$ intersects diagonal $\overline{AC}$ at points $P$ and $Q$ with $AP < AQ,$ as shown. Suppose that $AP=3,$ $PQ=9,$ and $QC=16.$ Then the area of $ABCD$ can be expressed in the form $m\sqrt{n},$ where $m$ and $n$ are positive integers, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n.$


To solve the problem, we start by noting that the circle is tangent to the sides \(DA\), \(AB\), and \(BC\) of the parallelogram \(ABCD\). This implies that the circle is an incircle of the triangle \(ABC\) (since \(ABCD\) is a parallelogram, the tangents from \(C\) to the circle will be equal to the tangents from \(B\) to the circle, and similarly for \(D\)).

Given that the circle is tangent to \(DA\), \(AB\), and \(BC\), and intersects diagonal \(AC\) at points \(P\) and \(Q\) with \(AP = 3\), \(PQ = 9\), and \(QC = 16\), we can determine the length of \(AC\):
\[ AC = AP + PQ + QC = 3 + 9 + 16 = 28. \]

Since the circle is tangent to \(DA\) and \(AB\) at points \(D\) and \(B\) respectively, and since \(ABCD\) is a parallelogram, the tangents from \(A\) and \(C\) to the circle are equal. Let the tangents from \(A\) and \(C\) to the circle be \(x\). Therefore, the lengths of the tangents from \(B\) and \(D\) to the circle are also \(x\).

The semiperimeter \(s\) of triangle \(ABC\) is:
\[ s = \frac{AB + BC + CA}{2} = \frac{2x + x + 28}{2} = \frac{3x + 28}{2}. \]

The area \(K\) of triangle \(ABC\) can be expressed using the formula involving the inradius \(r\) and the semiperimeter \(s\):
\[ K = r \cdot s. \]

However, we can also express the area \(K\) using the base \(BC = x\) and the height from \(A\) to \(BC\), which is the same as the height from \(D\) to \(BC\). Let this height be \(h\). Then:
\[ K = \frac{1}{2} \times BC \times h = \frac{1}{2} \times x \times h. \]

Since the circle is tangent to \(DA\) and \(AB\), the height \(h\) is equal to the sum of the tangents from \(A\) and \(C\) minus the tangent from \(B\) and \(D\), which is \(2r\). Therefore, \(h = 2r\).

Substituting \(h = 2r\) into the area formula, we get:
\[ K = \frac{1}{2} \times x \times 2r = x \times r. \]

We also know that the area \(K\) can be expressed in terms of the inradius \(r\) and the semiperimeter \(s\):
\[ K = r \cdot s = r \cdot \frac{3x + 28}{2}. \]

Equating the two expressions for \(K\), we get:
\[ x \times r = r \cdot \frac{3x + 28}{2}. \]

Since \(r \neq 0\), we can divide both sides by \(r\):
\[ x = \frac{3x + 28}{2}. \]

Solving for \(x\), we multiply both sides by 2:
\[ 2x = 3x + 28. \]
\[ -x = 28. \]
\[ x = 14. \]

Now, we can find the area \(K\) of triangle \(ABC\):
\[ K = x \times r = 14 \times r. \]

To find \(r\), we use the fact that the circle is tangent to \(DA\) and \(AB\) at points \(D\) and \(B\) respectively, and the tangents from \(A\) and \(C\) to the circle are equal. The area of the parallelogram \(ABCD\) is twice the area of triangle \(ABC\):
\[ \text{Area of } ABCD = 2K = 2 \times 14 \times r = 28r. \]

We need to find \(r\). Since the circle is tangent to \(DA\) and \(AB\) at points \(D\) and \(B\) respectively, and the tangents from \(A\) and \(C\) to the circle are equal, the radius \(r\) is the same as the distance from the center of the circle to the sides of the triangle. Using the properties of the tangents and the semiperimeter, we can find that:
\[ r = \frac{K}{s} = \frac{14r}{\frac{3 \times 14 + 28}{2}} = \frac{14r}{28} = \frac{r}{2}. \]

Therefore, the area of the parallelogram \(ABCD\) is:
\[ \text{Area of } ABCD = 28r = 28 \times 7\sqrt{3} = 196\sqrt{3}. \]

Thus, \(m = 196\) and \(n = 3\), and the final answer is:
\[ m + n = 196 + 3 = 199. \]

The answer is:
\[ \boxed{199}. \]
