 The problem: 
Find the three-digit positive integer $\underline{a}\,\underline{b}\,\underline{c}$ whose representation in base nine is $\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\,\underline{a}_{\,\text{nine}},$ where $a,$ $b,$ and $c$ are (not necessarily distinct) digits.


To solve the problem, we need to find a three-digit number \(\underline{a}\,\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\) such that its representation in base nine is \(\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\,\underline{a}_{\,\text{nine}}\). This means that the number \(\underline{a}\,\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\) in decimal is equal to the number \(\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\,\underline{a}_{\,\text{nine}}\) in decimal.

First, let's express the number \(\underline{a}\,\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\) in decimal form:
\[100a + 10b + c.\]

Next, let's express the number \(\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\,\underline{a}_{\,\text{nine}}\) in decimal form. Since \(\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\,\underline{a}_{\,\text{nine}}\) is a base nine number, it can be written as:
\[81b + 9c + a.\]

We need to find \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) such that:
\[100a + 10b + c = 81b + 9c + a.\]

Rearranging the terms, we get:
\[100a + 10b + c - 81b - 9c - a = 0,\]
\[99a - 71b - 8c = 0.\]

This simplifies to:
\[99a = 71b + 8c.\]

Since \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are digits (i.e., integers between 0 and 9), we need to find values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) that satisfy this equation. Let's test possible values for \(a\):

If \(a = 2\):
\[99 \cdot 2 = 198,\]
\[71b + 8c = 198.\]

We need to find \(b\) and \(c\) such that \(71b + 8c = 198\). Testing possible values for \(b\):

If \(b = 2\):
\[71 \cdot 2 + 8c = 198,\]
\[142 + 8c = 198,\]
\[8c = 56,\]
\[c = 7.\]

So, \(a = 2\), \(b = 2\), and \(c = 7\) is a solution. Let's verify this solution:

The number in decimal is:
\[100 \cdot 2 + 10 \cdot 2 + 7 = 227.\]

The number in base nine is:
\[227_{\,\text{decimal}} = 2\,\underline{7}\,\underline{2}_{\,\text{nine}}.\]

Converting \(272_{\,\text{nine}}\) to decimal:
\[2 \cdot 81 + 7 \cdot 9 + 2 = 162 + 63 + 2 = 227.\]

Since both representations are equal, the solution is correct. Therefore, the three-digit number is:
\[\boxed{227}.\]
