 The problem: 
Three spheres with radii $11$, $13$, and $19$ are mutually externally tangent. A plane intersects the spheres in three congruent circles centered at $A$, $B$, and $C$, respectively, and the centers of the spheres all lie on the same side of this plane. Suppose that $AB^2 = 560$. Find $AC^2$.


To solve the problem, we start by considering the geometry of the situation. Let the centers of the three spheres be \(O_1\), \(O_2\), and \(O_3\) with radii \(11\), \(13\), and \(19\) respectively. Since the spheres are mutually externally tangent, the distances between their centers are:
\[ O_1O_2 = 11 + 13 = 24, \]
\[ O_2O_3 = 13 + 19 = 32, \]
\[ O_3O_1 = 19 + 11 = 30. \]

The plane intersects the spheres in three congruent circles centered at points \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\) respectively. This means that the perpendicular distances from the centers \(O_1\), \(O_2\), and \(O_3\) to the plane are \(d_1\), \(d_2\), and \(d_3\) respectively, and these distances satisfy the relationships:
\[ d_1^2 + r_1^2 = d_2^2 + r_2^2 = d_3^2 + r_3^2 = R^2, \]
where \(R\) is the radius of the circles formed by the intersections. Therefore, we have:
\[ d_1^2 + 11^2 = d_2^2 + 13^2 = d_3^2 + 19^2 = R^2. \]

We can express \(d_1\), \(d_2\), and \(d_3\) in terms of \(R\):
\[ d_1^2 = R^2 - 121, \]
\[ d_2^2 = R^2 - 169, \]
\[ d_3^2 = R^2 - 361. \]

Given that \(AB^2 = 560\), we know that the distance between the centers of the circles \(A\) and \(B\) is the same as the distance between the centers of the spheres minus twice the radius of the circles:
\[ AB^2 = O_1O_2^2 - (2R)^2 = 24^2 - (2R)^2 = 576 - 4R^2. \]
Since \(AB^2 = 560\), we have:
\[ 576 - 4R^2 = 560, \]
\[ 4R^2 = 16, \]
\[ R^2 = 4. \]

Now, we need to find \(AC^2\). Using the same logic as above, we have:
\[ AC^2 = O_1O_3^2 - (2R)^2 = 30^2 - (2R)^2 = 900 - 4R^2. \]
Substituting \(R^2 = 4\) into the equation, we get:
\[ AC^2 = 900 - 4 \cdot 4 = 900 - 16 = 884. \]

Thus, the value of \(AC^2\) is:
\[ \boxed{884}. \]
