 The problem: 
Three spheres with radii $11$, $13$, and $19$ are mutually externally tangent. A plane intersects the spheres in three congruent circles centered at $A$, $B$, and $C$, respectively, and the centers of the spheres all lie on the same side of this plane. Suppose that $AB^2 = 560$. Find $AC^2$.


Alright, so I've got this geometry problem here about three spheres that are all touching each other externally. Their radii are 11, 13, and 19. There's a plane that cuts through all three spheres, creating three congruent circles. These circles are centered at points A, B, and C, which are the feet of the perpendiculars from the centers of the spheres onto the plane.

The problem tells me that AB squared is 560, and it's asking for AC squared. Hmm, okay. Let me try to visualize this. I imagine three spheres, each touching the other two. Then there's a flat plane slicing through them, making three equal-sized circles where it intersects each sphere. The centers of these circles (A, B, C) are directly below the centers of the spheres, right?

So, first things first, let's denote some variables. Let me call the centers of the spheres O1, O2, and O3 with radii r1=11, r2=13, and r3=19. Since the plane intersects each sphere in a circle, those circles must have the same radius, let's say k. The centers of these circles, A, B, C, are the projections of O1, O2, O3 onto the plane.

Given that, the distances from O1, O2, O3 to the plane must be equal to sqrt(r_i^2 - k^2), because when you slice a sphere with a plane, the distance from the center to the plane can be found using the Pythagorean theorem. So, if the radius of the sphere is r and the radius of the circle is k, then the distance d from the center to the plane is sqrt(r^2 - k^2).

Therefore, the distances from each center to the plane are:
- For O1: d1 = sqrt(11² - k²)
- For O2: d2 = sqrt(13² - k²)
- For O3: d3 = sqrt(19² - k²)

Now, since A, B, and C are the projections of O1, O2, O3 onto the plane, the triangle ABC is related to the triangle formed by O1, O2, O3, but scaled down by the distances from the centers to the plane.

Wait, actually, maybe not exactly scaled down, but the positions of A, B, C relative to each other depend on how much each Oi is above the plane. Hmm.

Let me think. If we consider the coordinates, perhaps it would help. Maybe I can set up a coordinate system where the plane is the xy-plane, so z=0. Then, the centers O1, O2, O3 will have coordinates (x1, y1, d1), (x2, y2, d2), (x3, y3, d3), and A, B, C will be (x1, y1, 0), (x2, y2, 0), (x3, y3, 0). Therefore, the distance between A and B is the same as the distance between O1 and O2 projected onto the plane, which is just sqrt((x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2). Similarly for AC.

But wait, actually, the distance between A and B is the same as the horizontal component of the distance between O1 and O2. Because O1O2 is a line segment connecting two points in space, and its projection onto the plane is AB. So, the length AB is less than or equal to O1O2.

Similarly, AC is the projection of O1O3 onto the plane, so AC is also less than or equal to O1O3.

But we know AB² = 560. So, if we can find expressions for AB², AC², etc., in terms of O1O2², O1O3², and the heights d1, d2, d3, maybe we can relate them.

Yes, so here's an idea: the square of the distance between A and B is equal to the square of the distance between O1 and O2 minus the squares of their distances to the plane. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Actually, AB is the projection of O1O2 onto the plane, so the distance between A and B is equal to the length of O1O2 multiplied by cos(theta), where theta is the angle between O1O2 and the normal to the plane.

Alternatively, more formally, using vector projections: if n is the unit normal vector to the plane, then the projection of vector O1O2 onto the plane is equal to O1O2 - (O1O2 · n) n. So, the squared length of AB would be |O1O2|² - (O1O2 · n)².

But perhaps another way to look at it is via the Pythagorean theorem. The distance between O1 and O2 is sqrt(|AB|² + (d1 - d2)^2). Wait, is that correct? Hmm, not quite, because the difference in heights isn't necessarily along the line connecting O1 and O2 unless the plane is such that the normals are aligned.

Hmm, maybe I need to clarify this.

Let me denote the plane as π. The centers O1, O2, O3 are at distances d1, d2, d3 above the plane. The centers A, B, C are their projections onto π.

So, the distance between A and B can be thought of as the distance between O1 and O2 in the plane π, which is equivalent to the distance between O1 and O2 minus the vertical component.

Wait, another approach: if we consider vectors, the distance between A and B is equal to the length of the projection of vector O1O2 onto π. The projection of a vector onto a plane is equal to the original vector minus its component normal to the plane. So, if we have vector O1O2, its projection onto π is O1O2 - (O1O2 · n) n, where n is the unit normal vector.

Therefore, the squared length of AB is |O1O2|² - (O1O2 · n)².

Similarly, the squared lengths AC is |O1O3|² - (O1O3 · n)².

But we don't know n yet. However, maybe we can relate these equations.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use the fact that the centers O1, O2, O3 form a tetrahedron with the plane π, and that the projections A, B, C form a triangle on π.

Wait, maybe coordinate geometry would help here. Let me assign coordinates.

Let’s assume the plane π is the xy-plane for simplicity, so z=0. Then, the centers O1, O2, O3 will have coordinates (x1, y1, d1), (x2, y2, d2), (x3, y3, d3), and A, B, C are (x1, y1, 0), (x2, y2, 0), (x3, y3, 0).

We are told that AB² = 560. So, the distance between A and B is sqrt[(x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2] = sqrt(560). Thus, (x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2 = 560.

Similarly, AC² would be (x1 - x3)^2 + (y1 - y3)^2.

Our goal is to find AC² given AB².

But we need more information. Let's recall that the spheres are mutually externally tangent. So, the distance between any two centers should be equal to the sum of their radii.

Therefore:

Distance O1O2 = r1 + r2 = 11 + 13 = 24

Distance O1O3 = r1 + r3 = 11 + 19 = 30

Distance O2O3 = r2 + r3 = 13 + 19 = 32

So, in coordinates, O1O2 is 24, O1O3 is 30, and O2O3 is 32.

But O1O2 is the distance between (x1, y1, d1) and (x2, y2, d2). So,

sqrt[(x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2 + (d1 - d2)^2] = 24

But we already know that (x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2 = 560, so substituting:

sqrt[560 + (d1 - d2)^2] = 24

Squaring both sides:

560 + (d1 - d2)^2 = 576

Therefore, (d1 - d2)^2 = 576 - 560 = 16

Thus, d1 - d2 = ±4. But since all centers are on the same side of the plane, which is z=0, and the plane is cutting through the spheres externally, so probably d1, d2, d3 are positive.

But we don't know whether d1 > d2 or vice versa. Hmm, but since the projection distances are involved, maybe the sign doesn't matter. Let's just note that (d1 - d2)^2 = 16.

Similarly, let's compute O1O3 and O2O3.

For O1O3: sqrt[(x1 - x3)^2 + (y1 - y3)^2 + (d1 - d3)^2] = 30

We need AC², which is (x1 - x3)^2 + (y1 - y3)^2. Let's call this value M. So,

sqrt[M + (d1 - d3)^2] = 30

Therefore, M + (d1 - d3)^2 = 900

Similarly, for O2O3: sqrt[(x2 - x3)^2 + (y2 - y3)^2 + (d2 - d3)^2] = 32

Let’s denote (x2 - x3)^2 + (y2 - y3)^2 as N, so:

sqrt[N + (d2 - d3)^2] = 32

Thus, N + (d2 - d3)^2 = 1024

But we also know that AC² is M, and BC² is N. We might need another equation to relate these.

Also, remember that the radii of the circles are equal. So, the radius k of each circle satisfies:

k² = r1² - d1² = 121 - d1²

k² = r2² - d2² = 169 - d2²

k² = r3² - d3² = 361 - d3²

Since all these are equal to k², we can set them equal to each other:

121 - d1² = 169 - d2² => d2² - d1² = 169 - 121 = 48

Similarly, 121 - d1² = 361 - d3² => d3² - d1² = 361 - 121 = 240

And 169 - d2² = 361 - d3² => d3² - d2² = 361 - 169 = 192

So, we have the following:

1. d2² - d1² = 48
2. d3² - d1² = 240
3. d3² - d2² = 192

Let me check if these are consistent. From equation 1: d2² = d1² + 48

From equation 2: d3² = d1² + 240

From equation 3: d3² - d2² = (d1² + 240) - (d1² + 48) = 192, which matches equation 3. So, consistent.

Now, going back to our previous equations involving M and N.

We had:

M + (d1 - d3)^2 = 900

N + (d2 - d3)^2 = 1024

But M is AC², which is what we need to find. N is BC², which is not given, but perhaps we can relate M and N through something else.

Wait, but we also know that in the plane, ABC is a triangle. The sides of triangle ABC are AB, BC, AC, which are sqrt(560), sqrt(N), sqrt(M). So, triangle ABC has sides sqrt(560), sqrt(N), sqrt(M).

Additionally, the triangle O1O2O3 has sides 24, 30, 32.

Is there a relationship between these triangles?

Wait, perhaps yes. Because ABC is the projection of O1O2O3 onto the plane π. So, the edges of ABC are the projections of the corresponding edges of O1O2O3 onto π.

In other words, the length of AB is the projection of O1O2 onto π, BC is the projection of O2O3 onto π, and AC is the projection of O1O3 onto π.

Therefore, we can write:

AB² = |O1O2|² - (d1 - d2)^2

Which we already did earlier, and found (d1 - d2)^2 = 16

Similarly,

BC² = |O2O3|² - (d2 - d3)^2 = 32² - (d2 - d3)^2 = 1024 - (d2 - d3)^2

But BC² = N, so N = 1024 - (d2 - d3)^2

Similarly,

AC² = |O1O3|² - (d1 - d3)^2 = 30² - (d1 - d3)^2 = 900 - (d1 - d3)^2

So, if we can find (d1 - d3)^2, we can get AC².

But let's see if we can express (d1 - d3)^2 in terms of known quantities.

From earlier, we have:

d2² - d1² = 48

d3² - d1² = 240

So, subtracting these two equations:

(d3² - d1²) - (d2² - d1²) = 240 - 48 => d3² - d2² = 192

Which is consistent with equation 3.

But how does this help us? Hmm.

Wait, let's express (d1 - d3)^2. That's equal to d1² - 2 d1 d3 + d3².

Similarly, (d1 - d2)^2 = d1² - 2 d1 d2 + d2² = 16 (from earlier)

And (d2 - d3)^2 = d2² - 2 d2 d3 + d3² = ?

We know that d3² - d2² = 192, so:

(d2 - d3)^2 = (d2² - d3²) + 2 d3² - 2 d2 d3? Wait, no.

Wait, (d2 - d3)^2 = d2² - 2 d2 d3 + d3² = (d3² - d2²) - 2 d2 d3 + 2 d2²

Wait, maybe not helpful.

Alternatively, we can express (d1 - d3)^2 as follows:

We have d3² = d1² + 240

So,

(d1 - d3)^2 = d1² - 2 d1 d3 + d3² = d1² - 2 d1 d3 + d1² + 240 = 2 d1² - 2 d1 d3 + 240

Hmm, still complicated.

Wait, perhaps if we can find d1, d2, d3 individually?

We have:

From d2² = d1² + 48

From d3² = d1² + 240

Also, we have from O1O3:

sqrt[M + (d1 - d3)^2] = 30, so M + (d1 - d3)^2 = 900

But M is AC², which is what we need to find.

Similarly, from O2O3:

sqrt[N + (d2 - d3)^2] = 32, so N + (d2 - d3)^2 = 1024

But N is BC², which we don't know.

Wait, but if we can express everything in terms of d1, maybe we can solve for it.

Let me denote d1 as t. Then,

d2² = t² + 48

d3² = t² + 240

Then,

(d1 - d3)^2 = t² - 2 t d3 + d3² = t² - 2 t d3 + t² + 240 = 2 t² - 2 t d3 + 240

Similarly,

(d2 - d3)^2 = (sqrt(t² + 48) - sqrt(t² + 240))²

This seems messy. Maybe another approach.

Wait, perhaps we can express (d1 - d3)^2 and (d2 - d3)^2 in terms of t.

Let’s compute (d1 - d3)^2:

= (t - sqrt(t² + 240))²

= t² - 2 t sqrt(t² + 240) + t² + 240

= 2 t² + 240 - 2 t sqrt(t² + 240)

Similarly, (d2 - d3)^2:

= (sqrt(t² + 48) - sqrt(t² + 240))²

= (t² + 48) - 2 sqrt(t² + 48) sqrt(t² + 240) + (t² + 240)

= 2 t² + 288 - 2 sqrt{(t² + 48)(t² + 240)}

Hmm, this is getting too complicated. Maybe there's a better way.

Wait, let's recall that:

From the projections:

AB² = |O1O2|² - (d1 - d2)^2 = 560

Which gave us (d1 - d2)^2 = 16

Similarly, AC² = |O1O3|² - (d1 - d3)^2 = 900 - (d1 - d3)^2

And BC² = |O2O3|² - (d2 - d3)^2 = 1024 - (d2 - d3)^2

But we also have triangle ABC with sides sqrt(560), sqrt(N), sqrt(M). So, by the triangle inequality, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third, but I'm not sure if that helps here.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use the fact that the points A, B, C lie on the plane, and the lines O1O2, O1O3, O2O3 project onto the plane as AB, AC, BC.

Maybe if we consider the angles between the planes or something. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another thought: Since all the spheres are mutually tangent, their centers form a triangle O1O2O3 with sides 24, 30, 32. The radii differences give us the tangency conditions.

Moreover, the projections of these centers onto the plane π form triangle ABC with sides sqrt(560), sqrt(N), sqrt(M). The relationship between these triangles might be similar or have proportional sides?

Alternatively, maybe the ratio between the areas or something else is preserved.

Wait, perhaps we can relate the heights d1, d2, d3 with the sides of the triangle.

Wait, let me think about the formula for the area of triangle O1O2O3. Maybe Heron's formula can help.

Compute the area of O1O2O3 with sides 24, 30, 32.

First, compute semi-perimeter: s = (24 + 30 + 32)/2 = (86)/2 = 43

Area = sqrt[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)] = sqrt[43*(43 - 24)*(43 - 30)*(43 - 32)] = sqrt[43*19*13*11]

Calculate that:

43 * 19 = 817

13 * 11 = 143

Then, 817 * 143. Hmm, 800*143=114,400; 17*143=2,431; total is 114,400 + 2,431 = 116,831

So, Area = sqrt(116,831). Let me compute sqrt(116,831). Hmm, 341^2 = 116,281, 342^2 = 116,964. So, sqrt(116,831) is approximately between 341 and 342, but exact value is irrational. Maybe leave it as sqrt(43*19*13*11).

But perhaps not useful immediately.

Wait, but also, the area of triangle ABC can be related to the area of O1O2O3. Since ABC is the projection of O1O2O3 onto the plane π, the area of ABC is equal to the area of O1O2O3 multiplied by cos(theta), where theta is the angle between the planes.

But the plane π is arbitrary, so unless we know the dihedral angle between the two planes, which we don't, this might not help.

Alternatively, maybe we can use vector algebra. Let me define vectors.

Let’s consider vectors O1A, O2B, O3C. These are the vectors from the centers to their respective projections on π, which are perpendicular to π. So, they are along the normal vector n of π.

Therefore, vectors O1A, O2B, O3C are scalar multiples of n. Since the plane π is the xy-plane, n is along the z-axis, so these vectors are purely vertical.

Hence, O1A = (0, 0, d1), O2B = (0, 0, d2), O3C = (0, 0, d3)

Therefore, the vectors O1O2, O1O3, O2O3 can be decomposed into horizontal and vertical components.

Specifically, vector O1O2 = AB + (O1A - O2B) = AB + (0, 0, d1 - d2)

Similarly, vector O1O3 = AC + (0, 0, d1 - d3)

Vector O2O3 = BC + (0, 0, d2 - d3)

So, if we write these vectors:

O1O2 = AB + (0, 0, d1 - d2)

O1O3 = AC + (0, 0, d1 - d3)

O2O3 = BC + (0, 0, d2 - d3)

But in reality, these are vectors in 3D space. So, the magnitude squared of O1O2 is |AB|² + (d1 - d2)².

Which is exactly what we used before. So, that gives us the relation |O1O2|² = |AB|² + (d1 - d2)², which we already applied.

So, perhaps we can consider that the vectors AB, AC, BC are orthogonal to the vertical vectors (0,0,d1-d2), etc., meaning that the horizontal and vertical components are orthogonal.

Therefore, the horizontal components of O1O2, O1O3, O2O3 are AB, AC, BC respectively, while the vertical components are the differences in heights.

Given that, perhaps we can model the triangle ABC as a "shadow" of triangle O1O2O3 onto the plane π, with the vertical offsets being d1, d2, d3.

But I'm not sure if that analogy helps directly.

Wait, perhaps another approach: since ABC is the projection, we can relate the areas.

The area of triangle ABC is equal to the area of triangle O1O2O3 times the cosine of the angle between the planes. But without knowing the angle, maybe we can relate the squares of the areas?

Alternatively, since we have the lengths AB, AC, BC in terms of the edges of O1O2O3 and the differences in heights, maybe we can use the Pythagorean theorem in 3D.

Wait, considering the coordinates again, since O1, O2, O3 are in 3D, and A, B, C are their projections, then the triangles O1O2O3 and ABC are related via the projection.

But perhaps it's too vague.

Wait, let's go back to the expressions we had:

From O1O2:

560 + (d1 - d2)^2 = 24² = 576

So, (d1 - d2)^2 = 16

From O1O3:

AC² + (d1 - d3)^2 = 30² = 900

From O2O3:

BC² + (d2 - d3)^2 = 32² = 1024

We need to find AC², but we have two more unknowns: AC² and BC², and two more equations involving d1, d2, d3.

But we also have relations from the circles' radii:

From 121 - d1² = 169 - d2² = 361 - d3²

Which gave us:

d2² - d1² = 48

d3² - d1² = 240

So, d3² - d2² = 192

So, now, we have four equations:

1. (d1 - d2)^2 = 16

2. (d1 - d3)^2 = ?

3. (d2 - d3)^2 = ?

4. d2² - d1² = 48

5. d3² - d1² = 240

6. d3² - d2² = 192

So, equations 4, 5, 6 can be expressed as:

From equation 4: d2² = d1² + 48

From equation 5: d3² = d1² + 240

From equation 6: d3² - d2² = 192, which is consistent with 240 - 48 = 192.

So, we can express d2 and d3 in terms of d1.

Let me denote d1 = t.

Then,

d2² = t² + 48

d3² = t² + 240

So, d2 = sqrt(t² + 48)

d3 = sqrt(t² + 240)

Therefore, (d1 - d2)^2 = (t - sqrt(t² + 48))² = t² - 2 t sqrt(t² + 48) + t² + 48 = 2 t² + 48 - 2 t sqrt(t² + 48)

But from equation 1, (d1 - d2)^2 = 16

Therefore:

2 t² + 48 - 2 t sqrt(t² + 48) = 16

Simplify:

2 t² + 48 - 16 = 2 t sqrt(t² + 48)

2 t² + 32 = 2 t sqrt(t² + 48)

Divide both sides by 2:

t² + 16 = t sqrt(t² + 48)

Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root:

(t² + 16)^2 = t² (t² + 48)

Expand left side:

t⁴ + 32 t² + 256 = t⁴ + 48 t²

Subtract t⁴ from both sides:

32 t² + 256 = 48 t²

Bring all terms to one side:

32 t² + 256 - 48 t² = 0 => -16 t² + 256 = 0 => -16 t² = -256 => t² = 16

Therefore, t = 4 or t = -4. Since t is a distance, we take t = 4.

Therefore, d1 = 4.

Then, d2² = 4² + 48 = 16 + 48 = 64, so d2 = 8

Similarly, d3² = 4² + 240 = 16 + 240 = 256, so d3 = 16

So, we found d1 = 4, d2 = 8, d3 = 16

Wow, that was a lot!

So, now, with these values, let's find AC².

From earlier, AC² = |O1O3|² - (d1 - d3)^2 = 30² - (4 - 16)^2 = 900 - (-12)^2 = 900 - 144 = 756

Wait, hold on. Is that correct?

Wait, let's verify.

Wait, |O1O3|² is 30² = 900

(d1 - d3)^2 = (4 - 16)^2 = (-12)^2 = 144

So, AC² = 900 - 144 = 756

Therefore, AC² is 756.

But let me double-check if this makes sense.

We found d1 = 4, d2 = 8, d3 = 16

Therefore, from the circle equality:

k² = 121 - 16 = 105

k² = 169 - 64 = 105

k² = 361 - 256 = 105

Perfect, all equal to 105, so k = sqrt(105)

Good.

Also, let's check if with these heights, the distances between O1O2, etc., match.

Compute |O1O2|: sqrt[(x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2 + (d1 - d2)^2] = sqrt[560 + (4 - 8)^2] = sqrt[560 + 16] = sqrt[576] = 24, which is correct.

Similarly, |O1O3|: sqrt[AC² + (d1 - d3)^2] = sqrt[756 + 144] = sqrt[900] = 30, correct.

And |O2O3|: sqrt[BC² + (d2 - d3)^2]. We haven't computed BC yet, but let's calculate it.

BC² = |O2O3|² - (d2 - d3)^2 = 1024 - (8 - 16)^2 = 1024 - (-8)^2 = 1024 - 64 = 960

Therefore, BC² = 960

But wait, let me check if triangle ABC with sides sqrt(560), sqrt(960), sqrt(756) forms a valid triangle.

Compute the approximate lengths:

sqrt(560) ≈ 23.66

sqrt(756) ≈ 27.50

sqrt(960) ≈ 30.98

Check triangle inequalities:

23.66 + 27.50 ≈ 51.16 > 30.98 ✔️

23.66 + 30.98 ≈ 54.64 > 27.50 ✔️

27.50 + 30.98 ≈ 58.48 > 23.66 ✔️

So, yes, it is a valid triangle.

But let me also ensure that the projection makes sense.

Given that the centers are at heights 4, 8, 16, the projections are 4 units below each center on the plane.

So, A is 4 units below O1, B is 8 units below O2, and C is 16 units below O3.

Thus, the distances between A, B, C are calculated correctly as sqrt(560), sqrt(756), sqrt(960).

But let me make sure that the calculations of AC² is correct.

Earlier, AC² = |O1O3|² - (d1 - d3)^2 = 30² - (4 - 16)^2 = 900 - 144 = 756

Yes, that's correct.

So, after all that, AC² is 756.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{756}

Given three spheres with radii 11, 13, and 19 that are mutually externally tangent, we need to find the square of the distance \(AC^2\) where a plane intersects the spheres in three congruent circles centered at \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\). The centers of the spheres are denoted as \(O_1\), \(O_2\), and \(O_3\) with radii 11, 13, and 19 respectively. The distances between the centers are calculated as follows:

- Distance \(O_1O_2 = 11 + 13 = 24\)
- Distance \(O_1O_3 = 11 + 19 = 30\)
- Distance \(O_2O_3 = 13 + 19 = 32\)

The plane intersects the spheres in three congruent circles, implying the distances from the centers of the spheres to the plane are equal to the radii of the circles. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we find the relationships between the distances from the centers to the plane:

- Let \(d_1\), \(d_2\), and \(d_3\) be the distances from \(O_1\), \(O_2\), and \(O_3\) to the plane.
- The radii of the circles are equal, leading to the equations:
  \[
  121 - d_1^2 = 169 - d_2^2 = 361 - d_3^2
  \]
- Solving these, we find:
  \[
  d_2^2 - d_1^2 = 48
  \]
  \[
  d_3^2 - d_1^2 = 240
  \]
  \[
  d_3^2 - d_2^2 = 192
  \]

Using the given \(AB^2 = 560\), we apply the Pythagorean theorem to find the vertical distances between the centers:
- The distance between \(O_1\) and \(O_2\) is given by:
  \[
  \sqrt{560 + (d_1 - d_2)^2} = 24
  \]
  \[
  560 + (d_1 - d_2)^2 = 576
  \]
  \[
  (d_1 - d_2)^2 = 16
  \]

Solving for \(d_1\), \(d_2\), and \(d_3\):
- Let \(d_1 = t\), then \(d_2 = \sqrt{t^2 + 48}\) and \(d_3 = \sqrt{t^2 + 240}\).
- Substituting into the equation for \((d_1 - d_2)^2\), we find \(t = 4\), giving \(d_1 = 4\), \(d_2 = 8\), and \(d_3 = 16\).

Finally, calculating \(AC^2\):
- The distance \(AC\) is found using the projection of \(O_1O_3\) onto the plane:
  \[
  AC^2 = |O_1O_3|^2 - (d_1 - d_3)^2 = 30^2 - (4 - 16)^2 = 900 - 144 = 756
  \]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{756}
\]
