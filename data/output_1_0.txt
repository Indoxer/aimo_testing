 The problem: 
Three spheres with radii $11$, $13$, and $19$ are mutually externally tangent. A plane intersects the spheres in three congruent circles centered at $A$, $B$, and $C$, respectively, and the centers of the spheres all lie on the same side of this plane. Suppose that $AB^2 = 560$. Find $AC^2$.


Alright, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. So, we have three spheres with radii 11, 13, and 19. They're all externally tangent to each other. There's a plane that cuts through each sphere, creating three congruent circles. These circles are centered at points A, B, and C, which are the feet of the perpendiculars from the centers of the spheres onto the plane. All the centers of the spheres are on the same side of the plane. We know that AB squared is 560, and we need to find AC squared.

First, I need to visualize the setup. We have three spheres touching each other externally, so their centers form a triangle where each side is equal to the sum of the radii of the corresponding pair of spheres. Let me denote the centers of the spheres as O₁, O₂, and O₃ with radii r₁=11, r₂=13, and r₃=19 respectively.

Since the spheres are externally tangent, the distance between O₁ and O₂ should be r₁ + r₂ = 11 + 13 = 24. Similarly, the distances between O₁ and O₃ is 11 + 19 = 30, and between O₂ and O₃ is 13 + 19 = 32. So, the triangle formed by the centers is a triangle with sides 24, 30, and 32. Hmm, interesting. Maybe it's a right triangle? Let me check: 24² + 30² = 576 + 900 = 1476, while 32² is 1024. Nope, not a right triangle. Okay.

Now, there's a plane cutting each sphere, resulting in three congruent circles. Since the circles are congruent, they must have the same radius. Let's call this common radius t. The centers of these circles, A, B, and C, are the projections of O₁, O₂, O₃ onto the plane. Therefore, the distance from each center Oᵢ to the plane is sqrt(rᵢ² - t²). Let me write that down:

Distance from O₁ to plane: d₁ = sqrt(11² - t²)
Distance from O₂ to plane: d₂ = sqrt(13² - t²)
Distance from O₃ to plane: d₃ = sqrt(19² - t²)

All these distances are on the same side of the plane since all centers are on the same side.

Now, we can think of points A, B, C lying on the plane, each at these respective distances from O₁, O₂, O₃. So, the line segments OA, OB, OC are perpendicular to the plane, and their lengths are d₁, d₂, d₃ respectively.

We also know that the points A, B, C form a triangle on the plane, and we're given AB² = 560. We need to find AC².

I recall that when you have two points projected from 3D space onto a plane, the square of the distance between their projections (like AB) can be related to the original distance between the points (like O₁O₂) and the distances from each point to the plane (d₁ and d₂).

Specifically, for points O₁ and O₂, the distance between their projections A and B on the plane satisfies:

AB² = O₁O₂² - (d₁ - d₂)²

Wait, is that correct? Let me think again. If you have two points in space, their projections on a plane are such that the distance between the projections relates to the original distance and the difference in heights (perpendicular distances to the plane). The formula should come from the Pythagorean theorem in 3D.

So, if we have O₁ above the plane at height d₁ and O₂ above the plane at height d₂, then the distance between A and B can be found using the Pythagorean theorem in the plane. The vertical component between O₁ and O₂ is |d₁ - d₂| because both are on the same side of the plane. The horizontal component is AB, and the hypotenuse would be the actual distance between O₁ and O₂, which is 24.

Therefore, yes, AB² + (d₁ - d₂)² = O₁O₂²

Similarly, for AC, we'll have AC² + (d₁ - d₃)² = O₁O₃² = 30² = 900

And similarly, BC² + (d₂ - d₃)² = O₂O₃² = 32² = 1024

Given that AB² = 560, let's plug into the first equation:

560 + (d₁ - d₂)² = 24² = 576

So, (d₁ - d₂)² = 576 - 560 = 16

Thus, d₁ - d₂ = ±4. But since both d₁ and d₂ are positive (they are square roots), and depending on whether d₁ is larger than d₂ or vice versa. But without loss of generality, let's assume d₁ > d₂, so d₁ - d₂ = 4.

Therefore, d₁ = d₂ + 4.

Now, we can express d₁ and d₂ in terms of t:

d₁ = sqrt(121 - t²)
d₂ = sqrt(169 - t²)

So, substituting into d₁ = d₂ + 4:

sqrt(121 - t²) = sqrt(169 - t²) + 4

Let me square both sides to eliminate the square roots:

[ sqrt(121 - t²) ]² = [ sqrt(169 - t²) + 4 ]²
121 - t² = (sqrt(169 - t²))² + 8*sqrt(169 - t²) + 16
Simplify:
121 - t² = 169 - t² + 8*sqrt(169 - t²) + 16

Wait, let's compute RHS:

( sqrt(a) + b )² = a + 2b*sqrt(a) + b²

Here, a = 169 - t², b = 4. So,

RHS = (169 - t²) + 8*sqrt(169 - t²) + 16

Hence,

LHS: 121 - t²
RHS: 169 - t² + 16 + 8*sqrt(169 - t²) = 185 - t² + 8*sqrt(169 - t²)

Subtracting LHS from both sides:

0 = 185 - t² + 8*sqrt(169 - t²) - (121 - t²)
Simplify:

0 = 185 - t² + 8*sqrt(169 - t²) - 121 + t²
The -t² and +t² cancel out.

0 = 64 + 8*sqrt(169 - t²)

So,

8*sqrt(169 - t²) = -64

Divide both sides by 8:

sqrt(169 - t²) = -8

But sqrt(169 - t²) is a non-negative number, so it cannot be equal to -8. This suggests that our assumption that d₁ - d₂ = 4 might be incorrect. Perhaps d₂ - d₁ = 4 instead?

Let me try that. If d₂ - d₁ = 4, then:

sqrt(169 - t²) - sqrt(121 - t²) = 4

Let me set x = sqrt(169 - t²), y = sqrt(121 - t²). Then, x - y = 4.

Also, note that x² - y² = (169 - t²) - (121 - t²) = 48.

So, we have:

x - y = 4
x² - y² = 48

But x² - y² factors as (x - y)(x + y) = 48.

From the first equation, x - y = 4, so:

4*(x + y) = 48 => x + y = 12.

Now, we have:

x - y = 4
x + y = 12

Adding these equations:

2x = 16 => x = 8

Then, y = 12 - x = 4.

So, x = 8 and y = 4.

Therefore,

sqrt(169 - t²) = 8 => 169 - t² = 64 => t² = 169 - 64 = 105

Similarly,

sqrt(121 - t²) = 4 => 121 - t² = 16 => t² = 121 - 16 = 105

So, t² = 105, which is consistent for both. So, t = sqrt(105). That makes sense.

So, now, we have d₁ = y = 4, and d₂ = x = 8.

Wait, hold on, earlier we had d₁ = sqrt(121 - t²) = 4, and d₂ = sqrt(169 - t²) = 8. So, indeed, d₂ - d₁ = 4.

Good, so that works. So, the heights are d₁ = 4, d₂ = 8, and d₃ we still need to find.

Now, we need to find AC². From the earlier reasoning, for points A and C, the distance between them squared plus (d₁ - d₃) squared equals O₁O₃ squared, which is 30² = 900.

So,

AC² + (d₁ - d₃)² = 900

We need to find AC², but we don't know d₃ yet. So, let's compute d₃.

d₃ = sqrt(r₃² - t²) = sqrt(19² - t²) = sqrt(361 - 105) = sqrt(256) = 16.

So, d₃ = 16.

Therefore, d₁ - d₃ = 4 - 16 = -12. The square of that is (-12)² = 144.

So, plugging back into the equation:

AC² + 144 = 900

Therefore, AC² = 900 - 144 = 756.

So, the answer is 756.

But wait, just to make sure, let's double-check the calculations.

We had t² = 105, so t = sqrt(105). Then,

d₁ = sqrt(121 - 105) = sqrt(16) = 4,
d₂ = sqrt(169 - 105) = sqrt(64) = 8,
d₃ = sqrt(361 - 105) = sqrt(256) = 16.

Yes, those are correct.

Then, for AC², since O₁O₃ = 30,

AC² + (d₁ - d₃)^2 = 30²
AC² + (4 - 16)^2 = 900
AC² + (-12)^2 = 900
AC² + 144 = 900
AC² = 756.

Yes, that seems consistent.

Just to ensure no step was missed, let me recap:

1. Three spheres with radii 11,13,19, all externally tangent. Centers form a triangle with sides 24,30,32.

2. Plane intersects each sphere in a circle of radius t, centers of circles A,B,C are projections of sphere centers O₁,O₂,O₃ onto the plane.

3. Distance between O₁ and O₂ is 24. The projection distance AB is 560^(1/2)=23.66... Wait, actually, no, AB² is 560, so AB is sqrt(560). But in our earlier step, we used the formula relating AB², O₁O₂², and (d₁ - d₂)^2.

Wait, hold on, perhaps I made an error here. Let me go back.

In the beginning, I thought about the relationship between AB², O₁O₂², and (d₁ - d₂)^2. Let me verify this.

If O₁ and O₂ are two points in space, with heights d₁ and d₂ above the plane, then the distance between their projections A and B on the plane is sqrt(O₁O₂² - (d₁ - d₂)^2). Is that correct?

Yes, because if you imagine the line connecting O₁ and O₂, which has length O₁O₂, and the vertical difference between them is |d₁ - d₂|. The projections A and B will form a right triangle with the line segment AB, the vertical difference, and the line connecting O₁ and O₂. So, by Pythagoras:

AB² + (d₁ - d₂)^2 = O₁O₂²

Which is exactly what we used earlier. So that part was correct.

Therefore, with AB² = 560, and O₁O₂² = 24² = 576, so (d₁ - d₂)^2 = 576 - 560 = 16, leading to d₁ - d₂ = ±4.

But since we assumed d₁ < d₂, we ended up with d₂ - d₁ = 4. So, that led us to solving for t, getting t² = 105, hence d₁ = 4, d₂ = 8, and d₃ = 16.

Then, AC² + (d₁ - d₃)^2 = O₁O₃² = 30² = 900

Calculates AC² = 900 - (12)^2 = 900 - 144 = 756.

Everything seems to check out.

So, after carefully going through each step and verifying my reasoning, I'm confident that the answer is 756.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{756}
</think>

We have three spheres with radii 11, 13, and 19, which are mutually externally tangent. A plane intersects each sphere, creating three congruent circles centered at points \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\). The centers of the spheres lie on the same side of this plane, and we know that \(AB^2 = 560\). We need to find \(AC^2\).

First, we note that the distances between the centers of the spheres are 24, 30, and 32. The plane intersects each sphere in a circle of radius \(t\), and the distances from the centers of the spheres to the plane are \(\sqrt{11^2 - t^2}\), \(\sqrt{13^2 - t^2}\), and \(\sqrt{19^2 - t^2}\).

Using the given information, we have:
- The distance between the projections of the centers of the spheres with radii 11 and 13 is \(AB = \sqrt{560}\).
- Using the Pythagorean theorem in 3D, we relate \(AB\) to the distances between the centers of the spheres and the heights \(d_1\), \(d_2\), and \(d_3\).

For the spheres with radii 11 and 13:
\[ AB^2 + (d_1 - d_2)^2 = O_1O_2^2 \]
\[ 560 + (d_1 - d_2)^2 = 24^2 \]
\[ 560 + (d_1 - d_2)^2 = 576 \]
\[ (d_1 - d_2)^2 = 16 \]
Assuming \(d_2 > d_1\), we get \(d_2 - d_1 = 4\).

Next, we calculate the heights \(d_1\), \(d_2\), and \(d_3\):
- \(d_1 = \sqrt{121 - t^2}\)
- \(d_2 = \sqrt{169 - t^2}\)
- \(d_3 = \sqrt{361 - t^2}\)

Using \(d_2 - d_1 = 4\), we solve for \(t\):
\[ \sqrt{169 - t^2} - \sqrt{121 - t^2} = 4 \]
Let \(x = \sqrt{169 - t^2}\) and \(y = \sqrt{121 - t^2}\):
\[ x - y = 4 \]
\[ x^2 - y^2 = 48 \]
\[ 4(x + y) = 48 \]
\[ x + y = 12 \]
Solving these, we find \(x = 8\) and \(y = 4\), leading to \(t^2 = 105\).

Finally, we calculate \(d_3\):
\[ d_3 = \sqrt{361 - 105} = 16 \]

Using the Pythagorean theorem for \(AC\):
\[ AC^2 + (d_1 - d_3)^2 = O_1O_3^2 \]
\[ AC^2 + (4 - 16)^2 = 30^2 \]
\[ AC^2 + 144 = 900 \]
\[ AC^2 = 900 - 144 = 756 \]

Thus, the answer is \(\boxed{756}\).
