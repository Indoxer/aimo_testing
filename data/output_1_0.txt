 The problem: 
Three spheres with radii $11$, $13$, and $19$ are mutually externally tangent. A plane intersects the spheres in three congruent circles centered at $A$, $B$, and $C$, respectively, and the centers of the spheres all lie on the same side of this plane. Suppose that $AB^2 = 560$. Find $AC^2$.


Alright, so I have this geometry problem here about three spheres that are all externally tangent to each other. Their radii are 11, 13, and 19 units. There's a plane that cuts through each sphere, creating three congruent circles. These circles are centered at points A, B, and C, which are presumably the feet of the perpendiculars from the centers of the spheres onto the plane. 

The problem tells me that AB squared is 560, and I need to find AC squared. Hmm, okay. So, let me break this down.

First off, since the plane intersects each sphere in a circle, and these circles are congruent, their radii must be equal. Let's denote the radius of each circle as r. That means each sphere is cut such that when you slice it with the plane, you get a circle of radius r. 

Now, for each sphere, the distance from its center to the plane can be found using the Pythagorean theorem. Specifically, if d is the distance from the center of a sphere to the plane, then d squared plus r squared equals the square of the sphere's radius. So, for each sphere:

- For the first sphere with radius 11: \( d_1^2 + r^2 = 11^2 = 121 \)
- For the second sphere with radius 13: \( d_2^2 + r^2 = 13^2 = 169 \)
- For the third sphere with radius 19: \( d_3^2 + r^2 = 19^2 = 361 \)

So, we can express each distance \( d_i \) as \( d_i = \sqrt{radius_i^2 - r^2} \). Therefore:

- \( d_1 = \sqrt{121 - r^2} \)
- \( d_2 = \sqrt{169 - r^2} \)
- \( d_3 = \sqrt{361 - r^2} \)

Now, the centers of the spheres all lie on the same side of the plane. That probably means that the distances \( d_1, d_2, d_3 \) are all measured in the same direction from the plane. So, if I consider the plane as z=0, then the centers of the spheres would have z-coordinates equal to \( d_1, d_2, d_3 \) respectively.

Given that, the points A, B, and C are the projections of the sphere centers onto the plane. So, A, B, and C form a triangle on the plane, right? And we know AB squared is 560. We need to find AC squared.

Hmm, how can I relate the distances between the centers (which are all known because the spheres are externally tangent) to the distances between their projections on the plane?

I remember that when you project points onto a plane, the distances between the projections relate to the original distances and the angles between the lines connecting the points and the plane. But since all centers lie on the same side of the plane, maybe we can model this in 3D coordinates.

Let me assign coordinates to make this more concrete. Let's assume that the plane is the xy-plane (z=0), and the centers of the spheres are at points \( O_1, O_2, O_3 \) with coordinates \( (x_1, y_1, d_1) \), \( (x_2, y_2, d_2) \), \( (x_3, y_3, d_3) \) respectively. Then, the projections A, B, C are just \( (x_1, y_1, 0) \), \( (x_2, y_2, 0) \), \( (x_3, y_3, 0) \).

The distance between A and B is given by the distance formula in the plane: \( AB^2 = (x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2 \). Similarly, \( AC^2 = (x_3 - x_1)^2 + (y_3 - y_1)^2 \).

But also, the distance between the centers \( O_1 \) and \( O_2 \) is equal to the sum of their radii because they're externally tangent. So, \( O_1O_2 = 11 + 13 = 24 \). Similarly, \( O_1O_3 = 11 + 19 = 30 \), and \( O_2O_3 = 13 + 19 = 32 \).

Wait a minute, so in 3D space, the distance between \( O_1 \) and \( O_2 \) is 24, which can be written as \( \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2 + (d_2 - d_1)^2} = 24 \). Squaring both sides gives:

\( (x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2 + (d_2 - d_1)^2 = 24^2 = 576 \)

But we know that \( AB^2 = (x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2 = 560 \). So substituting that into the equation above:

\( 560 + (d_2 - d_1)^2 = 576 \)

Therefore, \( (d_2 - d_1)^2 = 576 - 560 = 16 \), so \( d_2 - d_1 = \pm 4 \). Since all centers are on the same side of the plane, and assuming the plane is below them, the distances \( d_i \) are positive, but whether \( d_2 > d_1 \) or not depends on the configuration. However, regardless of the sign, the square will be positive. So, \( (d_2 - d_1)^2 = 16 \).

Similarly, I can set up equations for the other pairs.

For \( O_1O_3 = 30 \):

\( (x_3 - x_1)^2 + (y_3 - y_1)^2 + (d_3 - d_1)^2 = 900 \)

We need to find \( AC^2 = (x_3 - x_1)^2 + (y_3 - y_1)^2 \), which is exactly what we're looking for. Let's denote this as \( c^2 \). So,

\( c^2 + (d_3 - d_1)^2 = 900 \)

Similarly, for \( O_2O_3 = 32 \):

\( (x_3 - x_2)^2 + (y_3 - y_2)^2 + (d_3 - d_2)^2 = 1024 \)

Let me denote \( BC^2 = (x_3 - x_2)^2 + (y_3 - y_2)^2 \). But we don't know BC, though perhaps we can relate it somehow.

But hold on, maybe there's another way. Let's think about the coordinates. If I subtract the coordinates of A, B, C from the centers, I might get some relationships.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use vector algebra or coordinate systems.

Wait, another thought: since all three centers project down to A, B, C on the plane, and given the distances between the centers, maybe we can model this in 3D as a tetrahedron where the base is triangle ABC and the apexes are O1, O2, O3.

But perhaps that's complicating things. Maybe instead, focus on the differences in heights.

So, we have:

From O1O2: \( (d_2 - d_1)^2 = 16 \)

Similarly, for O1O3: \( (d_3 - d_1)^2 = 900 - c^2 \)

And for O2O3: \( (d_3 - d_2)^2 = 1024 - BC^2 \)

But we don't know BC either. Hmm, this seems like a system of equations with multiple variables.

Wait, but maybe we can relate \( (d_3 - d_2) \) to \( (d_3 - d_1) \) and \( (d_2 - d_1) \). Let's see:

Note that \( (d_3 - d_2) = (d_3 - d_1) - (d_2 - d_1) \). So,

\( (d_3 - d_2)^2 = [(d_3 - d_1) - (d_2 - d_1)]^2 = (d_3 - d_1)^2 - 2(d_3 - d_1)(d_2 - d_1) + (d_2 - d_1)^2 \)

But I'm not sure if that helps directly. Alternatively, perhaps express everything in terms of \( d_1, d_2, d_3 \).

We know:

1. \( d_2 = d_1 \pm 4 \) (since \( (d_2 - d_1)^2 = 16 \))
2. \( d_3^2 = 361 - r^2 \)
3. \( d_2^2 = 169 - r^2 \)
4. \( d_1^2 = 121 - r^2 \)

So, if I subtract 3 from 2, I get:

\( d_3^2 - d_2^2 = (361 - r^2) - (169 - r^2) = 361 - 169 = 192 \)

Similarly, subtracting 2 from 1:

\( d_2^2 - d_1^2 = (169 - r^2) - (121 - r^2) = 169 - 121 = 48 \)

So, \( d_3^2 - d_2^2 = 192 \) and \( d_2^2 - d_1^2 = 48 \). This gives us two equations.

Moreover, \( (d_2 - d_1)(d_2 + d_1) = 48 \). Since \( d_2 - d_1 = \pm 4 \), then:

If \( d_2 - d_1 = 4 \), then \( 4(d_2 + d_1) = 48 \) => \( d_2 + d_1 = 12 \)

If \( d_2 - d_1 = -4 \), then \( -4(d_2 + d_1) = 48 \) => \( d_2 + d_1 = -12 \). But since distances are positive, this case is impossible. So, \( d_2 - d_1 = 4 \) and \( d_2 + d_1 = 12 \).

Thus, solving these two equations:

Adding them: \( 2d_2 = 16 \) => \( d_2 = 8 \)

Subtracting: \( 2d_1 = 8 \) => \( d_1 = 4 \)

Wait, so \( d_1 = 4 \) and \( d_2 = 8 \). Then, plugging back into their respective expressions:

\( d_1 = \sqrt{121 - r^2} = 4 \) => \( 121 - r^2 = 16 \) => \( r^2 = 105 \)

Similarly, \( d_2 = \sqrt{169 - r^2} = 8 \) => \( 169 - r^2 = 64 \) => \( r^2 = 105 \). Perfect, consistent.

Then, \( d_3 = \sqrt{361 - r^2} = \sqrt{361 - 105} = \sqrt{256} = 16 \)

So, \( d_3 = 16 \). Okay, so now we know all three distances from the centers to the plane:

- \( d_1 = 4 \)
- \( d_2 = 8 \)
- \( d_3 = 16 \)

Great! Now, going back to the earlier equations.

We had:

1. \( AB^2 = 560 = (x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2 \)
2. \( (d_2 - d_1)^2 = 16 \) => which gave us \( d_2 - d_1 = 4 \)
3. \( AC^2 = (x_3 - x_1)^2 + (y_3 - y_1)^2 \) [This is what we need to find]
4. \( BC^2 = (x_3 - x_2)^2 + (y_3 - y_2)^2 \) [Unknown]

Also, from the distances between centers:

- \( O_1O_2^2 = 24^2 = 576 = (x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2 + (d_2 - d_1)^2 = 560 + 16 = 576 \) (Which checks out)
- \( O_1O_3^2 = 30^2 = 900 = (x_3 - x_1)^2 + (y_3 - y_1)^2 + (d_3 - d_1)^2 = AC^2 + (16 - 4)^2 = AC^2 + 144 \)
- \( O_2O_3^2 = 32^2 = 1024 = (x_3 - x_2)^2 + (y_3 - y_2)^2 + (d_3 - d_2)^2 = BC^2 + (16 - 8)^2 = BC^2 + 64 \)

So, let's write these out:

From \( O_1O_3 \):
\( 900 = AC^2 + 144 \)
Therefore, \( AC^2 = 900 - 144 = 756 \)

Wait, so is that the answer? 756? Hmm, let me check.

Wait, let's verify:

If \( AC^2 = 756 \), then \( BC^2 = 1024 - 64 = 960 \)

But does this satisfy any other conditions?

Also, thinking about the positions of the projections. If I imagine the points A, B, C on the plane with coordinates related to the centers, and knowing the differences in heights, perhaps we can model this as vectors or something else, but maybe that's overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the coordinates of A, B, C relative to each other.

Wait, so if I consider point A at (0,0,0), then point B is somewhere in the plane, say (a, b, 0), and point C is at (c, d, 0). Then, the distances AB, AC, BC can be represented accordingly.

But actually, without loss of generality, since we can choose coordinates such that point A is at the origin, and point B lies along the x-axis, simplifying calculations.

Let me try that approach.

Set point A at (0, 0, 0). Then, since AB^2 = 560, let's place point B at (sqrt(560), 0, 0). So, in the plane z=0, A is (0,0), B is (√560, 0), and C is (p, q, 0).

Then, the distances:

- AC^2 = p^2 + q^2
- BC^2 = (p - √560)^2 + q^2

We also know that O1 is at (0, 0, 4), O2 is at (√560, 0, 8), and O3 is at (p, q, 16).

Then, the distances between O1, O2, O3 should be 24, 30, 32 respectively.

So, let's compute O1O2:

Distance between (0,0,4) and (√560, 0,8):

√[(√560 - 0)^2 + (0 - 0)^2 + (8 - 4)^2] = √[560 + 0 + 16] = √576 = 24. Good.

O1O3:

Distance between (0,0,4) and (p, q,16):

√[(p - 0)^2 + (q - 0)^2 + (16 - 4)^2] = √[p^2 + q^2 + 144] = 30

So, squaring both sides: p^2 + q^2 + 144 = 900 => p^2 + q^2 = 756. Which is exactly AC^2. So, that's our answer.

Just to confirm, let's compute O2O3:

Distance between (√560, 0,8) and (p, q,16):

√[(p - √560)^2 + (q - 0)^2 + (16 - 8)^2] = √[(p - √560)^2 + q^2 + 64]

Squaring: (p - √560)^2 + q^2 + 64 = 1024

But (p - √560)^2 + q^2 = BC^2, which we don't know yet.

But we already have p^2 + q^2 = 756.

Expanding (p - √560)^2 + q^2: p^2 - 2√560 p + 560 + q^2 = (p^2 + q^2) - 2√560 p + 560 = 756 - 2√560 p + 560 = 1316 - 2√560 p

So, plug into the equation:

1316 - 2√560 p + 64 = 1024

So, 1380 - 2√560 p = 1024

Then, -2√560 p = 1024 - 1380 = -356

Divide both sides by -2√560:

p = (-356)/(-2√560) = 356/(2√560) = 178/√560

Simplify √560: √560 = √(16*35) = 4√35

So, p = 178/(4√35) = (89)/(2√35)

Rationalize denominator:

p = (89√35)/(2*35) = (89√35)/70

Okay, so p is expressed, and then q can be found via p^2 + q^2 = 756.

Compute p^2:

(89√35 / 70)^2 = (7921 * 35) / 4900 = (7921 * 35) / 4900

Calculate numerator: 7921 * 35

Well, 7921 * 30 = 237,630

7921 * 5 = 39,605

Total: 237,630 + 39,605 = 277,235

Denominator: 4900

So, p^2 = 277,235 / 4900 ≈ 56.578

But exact fraction: 277235 / 4900. Let me divide numerator and denominator by 5: 55,447 / 980. Doesn't seem to reduce further.

So, p^2 = 55,447 / 980 ≈ 56.578

Then, q^2 = 756 - p^2 ≈ 756 - 56.578 ≈ 699.422

Wait, but 756 is 756/1, so q^2 = 756 - 277235/4900

Convert 756 to 756 * 4900 / 4900 = 3,691,200 / 4900

So, q^2 = (3,691,200 - 277,235)/4900 = (3,691,200 - 277,235) = 3,413,965 / 4900 ≈ 696.625

Hmm, approximately 696.625, but let's keep it exact.

So, q^2 = (3,413,965)/4900

Wait, that seems messy, but perhaps it doesn't matter because we were only asked for AC^2, which is 756.

So, after all that calculation, I end up with AC^2 = 756.

Let me double-check my steps to ensure I didn't make a mistake.

1. Found that the distances from centers to plane are 4, 8, 16.
2. Set up coordinates with A at (0,0,0), B at (√560, 0,0), C at (p,q,0).
3. Calculated O1O3 distance leading to p^2 + q^2 = 756.
4. Verified with O2O3 distance, getting an expression for p, which is fine, but since we were only asked for AC^2, which was already found as 756.

Therefore, I feel confident that AC^2 is 756.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{756}
</think>

Given three spheres with radii 11, 13, and 19 that are mutually externally tangent, a plane intersects each sphere in three congruent circles. The centers of the spheres are on the same side of this plane. We know that \(AB^2 = 560\) and need to find \(AC^2\).

First, we note that the distances from the centers of the spheres to the plane are given by:
- \(d_1 = \sqrt{121 - r^2}\) for the sphere with radius 11,
- \(d_2 = \sqrt{169 - r^2}\) for the sphere with radius 13,
- \(d_3 = \sqrt{361 - r^2}\) for the sphere with radius 19.

We know that the distances between the centers of the spheres are the sums of their radii because they are externally tangent:
- The distance between the centers of the spheres with radii 11 and 13 is 24,
- The distance between the centers of the spheres with radii 11 and 19 is 30,
- The distance between the centers of the spheres with radii 13 and 19 is 32.

Using the Pythagorean theorem, we find the vertical distances from the centers to the plane:
- \(d_1 = 4\),
- \(d_2 = 8\),
- \(d_3 = 16\).

Next, we use the given distance \(AB^2 = 560\) and the vertical distances to find \(AC^2\). We know:
- The distance between the centers of the spheres with radii 11 and 19 is 30,
- The vertical difference between their distances to the plane is \(16 - 4 = 12\).

Using the Pythagorean theorem again, we have:
\[ AC^2 + (16 - 4)^2 = 30^2 \]
\[ AC^2 + 144 = 900 \]
\[ AC^2 = 900 - 144 \]
\[ AC^2 = 756 \]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{756}
\]
