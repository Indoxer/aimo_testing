 The problem: 
Let $S$ be the set of all rational numbers that can be expressed as a repeating decimal in the form $0.\overline{abcd},$ where at least one of the digits $a,$ $b,$ $c,$ or $d$ is nonzero. Let $N$ be the number of distinct numerators obtained when numbers in $S$ are written as fractions in lowest terms. For example, both $4$ and $410$ are counted among the distinct numerators for numbers in $S$ because $0.\overline{3636} = \frac{4}{11}$ and $0.\overline{1230} = \frac{410}{3333}.$ Find the remainder when $N$ is divided by $1000.$


To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of distinct numerators of rational numbers that can be expressed as a repeating decimal in the form \(0.\overline{abcd}\), where at least one of the digits \(a, b, c, d\) is nonzero. We start by expressing such a repeating decimal as a fraction.

A repeating decimal \(0.\overline{abcd}\) can be written as:
\[
0.\overline{abcd} = \frac{abcd}{9999}
\]
where \(abcd\) represents the four-digit number formed by the digits \(a, b, c, d\). Since \(abcd\) ranges from 1000 to 9999 (inclusive), we need to consider the fractions \(\frac{n}{9999}\) in their lowest terms, where \(n\) is an integer between 1 and 9999.

First, we factorize 9999:
\[
9999 = 3^2 \times 11 \times 101
\]
A fraction \(\frac{n}{9999}\) is in its lowest terms if and only if the greatest common divisor (gcd) of \(n\) and 9999 is 1. This means \(n\) must not be divisible by 3, 11, or 101.

We use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to count the number of integers from 1 to 9999 that are divisible by 3, 11, or 101. Let \(A\) be the set of integers from 1 to 9999 that are divisible by 3, \(B\) be the set of integers from 1 to 9999 that are divisible by 11, and \(C\) be the set of integers from 1 to 9999 that are divisible by 101. We need to find \(|A \cup B \cup C|\).

Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion:
\[
|A \cup B \cup C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A \cap B| - |A \cap C| - |B \cap C| + |A \cap B \cap C|
\]

Calculating each term:
\[
|A| = \left\lfloor \frac{9999}{3} \right\rfloor = 3333
\]
\[
|B| = \left\lfloor \frac{9999}{11} \right\rfloor = 909
\]
\[
|C| = \left\lfloor \frac{9999}{101} \right\rfloor = 99
\]
\[
|A \cap B| = \left\lfloor \frac{9999}{33} \right\rfloor = 303
\]
\[
|A \cap C| = \left\lfloor \frac{9999}{303} \right\rfloor = 33
\]
\[
|B \cap C| = \left\lfloor \frac{9999}{1111} \right\rfloor = 9
\]
\[
|A \cap B \cap C| = \left\lfloor \frac{9999}{3333} \right\rfloor = 3
\]

Substituting these values into the inclusion-exclusion formula:
\[
|A \cup B \cup C| = 3333 + 909 + 99 - 303 - 33 - 9 + 3 = 3998
\]

The number of integers from 1 to 9999 that are coprime with 9999 is:
\[
9999 - 3998 = 6001
\]

Thus, there are 6001 distinct numerators when numbers in \(S\) are written as fractions in lowest terms. The remainder when 6001 is divided by 1000 is:
\[
6001 \mod 1000 = 1
\]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{1}
\]
