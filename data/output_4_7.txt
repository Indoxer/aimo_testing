 The problem: 
Let $S$ be the set of all rational numbers that can be expressed as a repeating decimal in the form $0.\overline{abcd},$ where at least one of the digits $a,$ $b,$ $c,$ or $d$ is nonzero. Let $N$ be the number of distinct numerators obtained when numbers in $S$ are written as fractions in lowest terms. For example, both $4$ and $410$ are counted among the distinct numerators for numbers in $S$ because $0.\overline{3636} = \frac{4}{11}$ and $0.\overline{1230} = \frac{410}{3333}.$ Find the remainder when $N$ is divided by $1000.$


To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of distinct numerators when the rational numbers in the set \( S \) are written in their lowest terms. The set \( S \) consists of all rational numbers that can be expressed as a repeating decimal of the form \( 0.\overline{abcd} \), where at least one of the digits \( a, b, c, d \) is nonzero.

First, let's express a repeating decimal \( 0.\overline{abcd} \) as a fraction. A repeating decimal \( 0.\overline{abcd} \) can be written as:
\[
0.\overline{abcd} = \frac{abcd}{9999}
\]
where \( abcd \) represents the four-digit number formed by the digits \( a, b, c, d \).

Next, we need to find the number of distinct numerators when these fractions are in their lowest terms. This requires us to consider the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \( abcd \) and 9999. The number 9999 can be factored into prime factors as follows:
\[
9999 = 3^2 \times 11 \times 101
\]

For \( \frac{abcd}{9999} \) to be in its lowest terms, \( abcd \) must be coprime with 9999. Therefore, \( abcd \) must not share any prime factors with 9999. The prime factors of 9999 are 3, 11, and 101.

We will use Euler's Totient Function \( \phi(n) \) to count the number of integers up to \( n \) that are coprime with \( n \). For \( n = 9999 \):
\[
\phi(9999) = 9999 \left(1 - \frac{1}{3}\right) \left(1 - \frac{1}{11}\right) \left(1 - \frac{1}{101}\right)
\]
Calculating each term:
\[
\phi(9999) = 9999 \times \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{10}{11} \times \frac{100}{101}
\]
\[
\phi(9999) = 9999 \times \frac{2000}{3333}
\]
\[
\phi(9999) = 9999 \times \frac{2000}{3333} = 5928
\]

Thus, there are 5928 integers up to 9999 that are coprime with 9999. These integers represent the numerators of the fractions in \( S \) when written in their lowest terms.

Finally, we need to find the remainder when \( N = 5928 \) is divided by 1000:
\[
5928 \mod 1000 = 928
\]

Therefore, the remainder when \( N \) is divided by 1000 is:
\[
\boxed{928}
\]
