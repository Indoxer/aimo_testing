 The problem: 
In isosceles trapezoid $ABCD$, parallel bases $\overline{AB}$ and $\overline{CD}$ have lengths $500$ and $650$, respectively, and $AD=BC=333$. The angle bisectors of $\angle{A}$ and $\angle{D}$ meet at $P$, and the angle bisectors of $\angle{B}$ and $\angle{C}$ meet at $Q$. Find $PQ$.


To find the length \(PQ\) in the given isosceles trapezoid \(ABCD\), we start by analyzing the geometry of the trapezoid. Let's denote the lengths of the bases as \(AB = 500\) and \(CD = 650\), and the non-parallel sides as \(AD = BC = 333\).

First, we drop perpendiculars from points \(A\) and \(B\) to line \(CD\), meeting \(CD\) at points \(E\) and \(F\) respectively. This creates two right triangles, \(\triangle ADE\) and \(\triangle BCF\), and a rectangle \(ABFE\). The lengths of \(AE\) and \(BF\) are equal, and the length of \(EF\) is equal to the length of \(AB\), which is 500. Therefore, the lengths of \(DE\) and \(CF\) are each \(\frac{650 - 500}{2} = 75\).

Now, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the height \(h\) of the trapezoid:
\[
h = \sqrt{333^2 - 75^2} = \sqrt{110889 - 5625} = \sqrt{105264} = 324.
\]

Next, we need to find the coordinates of points \(P\) and \(Q\). Since \(P\) is the intersection of the angle bisectors of \(\angle A\) and \(\angle D\), and \(Q\) is the intersection of the angle bisectors of \(\angle B\) and \(\angle C\), both points \(P\) and \(Q\) lie on the line segment joining the midpoints of \(AB\) and \(CD\). This line segment is parallel to the bases and is located at half the height of the trapezoid from the base \(AB\).

The midpoint of \(AB\) is at a distance of \(\frac{500}{2} = 250\) from \(A\), and the midpoint of \(CD\) is at a distance of \(\frac{650}{2} = 325\) from \(C\). The distance between these midpoints is therefore \(325 - 250 = 75\).

Since \(P\) and \(Q\) are on this line segment, the distance \(PQ\) is equal to the distance between the midpoints of \(AB\) and \(CD\), which is 75.

Thus, the length of \(PQ\) is \(\boxed{333}\). However, upon re-evaluating the problem, we realize that the correct interpretation should be that \(PQ\) is the distance between the angle bisectors, which is the same as the distance between the midpoints of the bases. Therefore, the correct answer is \(\boxed{333}\).
