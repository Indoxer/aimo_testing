 The problem: 
Let $\triangle ABC$ have circumcenter $O$ and incenter $I$ with $\overline{IA}\perp\overline{OI}$, circumradius $13$, and inradius $6$. Find $AB\cdot AC$.


Okay, so I need to find AB multiplied by AC in triangle ABC. Let me see what information I have here.

First, the triangle has a circumradius (R) of 13 and an inradius (r) of 6. Also, it's given that the line IA is perpendicular to OI, where O is the circumcenter and I is the incenter.

Hmm, okay. Let me recall some properties related to triangle centers. The circumradius R relates to the sides of the triangle through the formula R = (a*b*c)/(4*Δ), where Δ is the area. But maybe that's not directly useful here.

The inradius r is related to the area Δ and the semiperimeter s by the formula r = Δ/s. So, if I can find s or relate it somehow, that might help.

Wait, also, there's a relationship between the distance between the incenter and circumcenter (OI). I remember the formula for OI squared is R(R - 2r). Let me confirm that... Yes, I think it's OI² = R² - 2Rr. So, plugging in R=13 and r=6, that would be OI² = 13² - 2*13*6 = 169 - 156 = 13. Therefore, OI is sqrt(13).

So, OI = sqrt(13).

Now, the key condition is that IA is perpendicular to OI. That seems important. Maybe I can use coordinate geometry? Let me try setting up a coordinate system.

Let me place point I at the origin (0,0) to simplify calculations because IA is perpendicular to OI. If I is at (0,0), then OI is just the vector from I to O. Since OI is sqrt(13), let me assign coordinates to O such that it lies along the x-axis for simplicity. So, O would be at (sqrt(13), 0).

But wait, hold on. If IA is perpendicular to OI, which is along the x-axis from (0,0) to (sqrt(13),0), then IA must be vertical, right? Because if OI is horizontal, IA being perpendicular would be vertical. So, point A must lie somewhere along the y-axis?

Wait, no. IA is the segment from I to A, which is from (0,0) to A. If IA is perpendicular to OI, which is along the x-axis, then IA must be vertical. So, yes, point A would have coordinates (0, k) for some k.

But triangle ABC has inradius 6. Wait, actually, the inradius is the radius of the incircle, which is centered at I (0,0). So, the distance from I to each side is 6.

If point A is at (0, k), then the distance from A to the incenter I is |k|, since it's along the y-axis. But wait, IA is supposed to be the length from I to A, which is |k|. But the inradius is 6, which is the distance from I to any side. Hmm, not sure how that connects yet.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider vectors or coordinate positions more carefully.

Let me try this again. Let me set I at (0,0). Then, O is at (d, 0) where d = OI = sqrt(13). Point A is somewhere else; since IA is perpendicular to OI, which is along the x-axis, IA must be vertical, as we thought before. So, point A is at (0, h) for some h.

Then, the distance from I to O is sqrt(13), so O is at (sqrt(13), 0). Now, point A is at (0, h). So, the line IA goes from (0,0) to (0,h), which is indeed vertical, and OI is along the x-axis. So, they are perpendicular. Okay, that checks out.

Now, since I is the incenter, it's located at the intersection of angle bisectors. In our coordinate system, it's at (0,0). The circumradius R is 13, meaning that the circumcircle has radius 13. So, points A, B, C all lie on a circle with radius 13 centered at O (sqrt(13), 0).

Point A is at (0, h), so its distance from O should be 13. Let me compute OA:

OA² = (sqrt(13) - 0)^2 + (0 - h)^2 = 13 + h²

But OA is equal to R, which is 13, so OA² = 13² = 169.

Therefore,

13 + h² = 169

h² = 169 - 13 = 156

h = sqrt(156) = 2*sqrt(39)

So, point A is at (0, 2√39). Okay, so IA is the distance from I (0,0) to A (0, 2√39), which is 2√39. So, IA = 2√39.

Given that IA is perpendicular to OI, which we've already incorporated into our coordinate system.

Now, I need to find AB * AC. Let me figure out how to get that.

Since I know point A is at (0, 2√39), and points B and C lie on the circumcircle centered at O (sqrt(13), 0) with radius 13. Also, I is the incenter at (0,0), so the distances from I to the sides are 6.

Hmm, perhaps I can find coordinates for points B and C.

Alternatively, maybe using trigonometric relationships.

Wait, another thought: in a triangle, the product AB * AC can be expressed in terms of other elements. For example, in terms of the circumradius, using the Law of Sines.

Law of Sines says that AB / sin C = AC / sin B = BC / sin A = 2R.

But I'm not sure if that directly helps with AB * AC.

Alternatively, maybe express AB and AC in terms of coordinates.

Given that points B and C are on the circumcircle, their coordinates satisfy the equation:

(x - sqrt(13))² + y² = 13²

Which simplifies to x² - 2x*sqrt(13) + 13 + y² = 169

Or, x² + y² - 2x*sqrt(13) = 156.

Also, since I is the incenter at (0,0), the distances from I to sides BC, AC, and AB are all equal to the inradius, which is 6.

Wait, the distance from I to side BC is 6. Since I is at (0,0), the equation of side BC can be written in the form ax + by + c = 0, and the distance from (0,0) to this line is |c| / sqrt(a² + b²) = 6.

Similarly, the same applies for sides AB and AC.

But maybe it's too vague without knowing specific coordinates.

Perhaps I can use barycentric coordinates or something else.

Alternatively, maybe I can recall that in any triangle, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter is OI² = R(R - 2r). Which we already used earlier to find OI = sqrt(13).

Moreover, there's a relation involving the distance from the incenter to a vertex.

Wait, there's a formula for the distance from the incenter to a vertex. Let me recall.

Yes, the distance from the incenter I to vertex A is given by:

IA² = R² - 2Rr

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right because OI² = R² - 2Rr.

Wait, let me check.

Wait, actually, in general, the distance from the incenter to vertex A can be found using the formula:

IA² = r² + (s - a)²

Where s is the semiperimeter, and a is the side opposite vertex A.

But I don't know s or a yet.

Alternatively, another formula: IA² = R^2 - (bc(s - a)/s)^2 or something like that.

Wait, maybe it's better to look for another approach.

Wait, in our coordinate system, we have I at (0,0), O at (sqrt(13),0), and A at (0, 2√39). So, point A is fixed.

We need to find points B and C on the circumcircle such that I is the incenter.

Hmm, incenter coordinates can be expressed in terms of the triangle vertices and sides.

Recall that the incenter (I) has coordinates:

I_x = (a*A_x + b*B_x + c*C_x)/(a + b + c)

I_y = (a*A_y + b*B_y + c*C_y)/(a + b + c)

But in our case, I is at (0,0), so:

0 = (a*A_x + b*B_x + c*C_x)/(a + b + c)

0 = (a*A_y + b*B_y + c*C_y)/(a + b + c)

Which implies:

a*A_x + b*B_x + c*C_x = 0

a*A_y + b*B_y + c*C_y = 0

But this seems complicated because we don't know the sides or the coordinates of B and C.

Wait, but we do know that A is at (0, 2√39), so A_x = 0, A_y = 2√39.

So, substituting:

a*0 + b*B_x + c*C_x = 0 => b*B_x + c*C_x = 0

a*(2√39) + b*B_y + c*C_y = 0 => 2√39*a + b*B_y + c*C_y = 0

But I don't know a, b, c, B, or C.

This seems like a dead end. Maybe I need another approach.

Wait, perhaps using trigonometric identities.

In triangle ABC, the inradius r = 6, circumradius R = 13.

We also have the condition IA perpendicular to OI.

Maybe we can relate angles or sides through trigonometric functions.

Wait, let's recall that IA is perpendicular to OI. So, the vector IA is perpendicular to the vector OI.

Expressed in vectors, that means (A - I) · (O - I) = 0.

In coordinates, since I is at (0,0), vector IA is (A_x, A_y), and vector OI is (O_x, O_y). Their dot product is zero.

Given that O is at (sqrt(13), 0) and I is at (0,0), vector OI is (sqrt(13), 0). Vector IA is (A_x, A_y). Their dot product is A_x*sqrt(13) + A_y*0 = A_x*sqrt(13) = 0.

Thus, A_x = 0.

Which matches our previous conclusion that point A is at (0, h). So, yeah, consistent.

Therefore, point A is at (0, 2√39), as we found earlier.

Now, points B and C lie on the circumcircle centered at (sqrt(13), 0) with radius 13, so their coordinates satisfy:

(x - sqrt(13))² + y² = 169.

Additionally, since I is the incenter, the distances from I to sides BC, AC, and AB are all equal to 6.

Given that I is at (0,0), the distance from I to side BC is 6. Similarly, the distance from I to side AB is 6, and to side AC is 6.

But computing these distances requires knowing the equations of the sides, which depends on points B and C.

Alternatively, maybe we can exploit some properties of triangle centers.

Wait, another idea: In triangle ABC, the distance from the incenter to vertex A is given by:

IA = √[r² + (s - a)²]

Where r is the inradius, s is the semiperimeter, and a is the side opposite vertex A.

In our case, IA is 2√39, r is 6, so:

(2√39)² = 6² + (s - a)²

So, 4*39 = 36 + (s - a)²

156 = 36 + (s - a)²

120 = (s - a)²

So, s - a = √120 = 2√30

Therefore, s = a + 2√30

But s is the semiperimeter, so s = (a + b + c)/2.

So, (a + b + c)/2 = a + 2√30

Multiply both sides by 2:

a + b + c = 2a + 4√30

Thus, b + c = a + 4√30

So, that gives a relationship between sides b, c, and a.

Additionally, we know that the circumradius R is 13, so using the formula:

a = 2R sin A

Similarly, b = 2R sin B, c = 2R sin C.

Therefore, a = 26 sin A, b = 26 sin B, c = 26 sin C.

So, plugging into b + c = a + 4√30:

26 sin B + 26 sin C = 26 sin A + 4√30

Divide both sides by 26:

sin B + sin C = sin A + (4√30)/26 = sin A + (2√30)/13

Hmm, okay. Also, in triangle ABC, we know that A + B + C = π.

Furthermore, since we have a coordinate system, perhaps we can relate angles to coordinates.

Wait, considering point A is at (0, 2√39), which is above the x-axis, and points B and C are somewhere on the circumcircle.

Given that, perhaps triangle ABC is isoceles? Not necessarily, but maybe.

Wait, if point A is at (0, 2√39), then OA is along the y-axis. The circumcircle is centered at (sqrt(13), 0). So, points B and C must be symmetric with respect to the x-axis? Maybe.

Because if A is at (0, h), and O is on the x-axis, perhaps B and C are reflections over the x-axis. That could make sense.

So, let me assume that points B and C are symmetric across the x-axis. So, if point B is at (x, y), then point C is at (x, -y).

That would mean that side BC is horizontal, lying on the line y = 0, but wait, no, because the circumcircle is centered at (sqrt(13), 0), so points B and C cannot both be on the x-axis unless the triangle is degenerate.

Wait, no, that can't be. Wait, if points B and C are symmetric across the x-axis, then BC is perpendicular to the x-axis, right?

Wait, actually, if B is (x, y) and C is (x, -y), then the midpoint of BC is (x, 0), so the line BC is vertical, passing through (x, 0). But the circumcircle is centered at (sqrt(13), 0), so unless x = sqrt(13), the center won't lie on the perpendicular bisector of BC.

Wait, the perpendicular bisector of BC would be the x-axis if BC is vertical? No, wait, if BC is vertical, its perpendicular bisector is horizontal, passing through the midpoint.

Wait, let's clarify. If BC is vertical, going through (x, y) and (x, -y), then its midpoint is (x, 0). The perpendicular bisector is the horizontal line y = 0, which is the x-axis. Since the circumcenter O is on the x-axis, that makes sense. So, yes, BC is vertical, and O lies on the x-axis, which is the perpendicular bisector of BC.

Therefore, points B and C are symmetric across the x-axis, so their coordinates are (x, y) and (x, -y).

So, with that in mind, let's denote:

B = (x, y)

C = (x, -y)

So, now, all three points A, B, C lie on the circumcircle centered at (sqrt(13), 0) with radius 13.

So, let's plug point A into the circumcircle equation:

(0 - sqrt(13))² + (2√39 - 0)^2 = (sqrt(13))² + (2√39)^2 = 13 + 4*39 = 13 + 156 = 169, which equals 13². So, correct.

Similarly, for point B (x, y):

(x - sqrt(13))² + y² = 169

Same for point C (x, -y):

(x - sqrt(13))² + (-y)^2 = 169, which is the same equation.

So, both points satisfy the same equation.

Therefore, we have:

(x - sqrt(13))² + y² = 169

Expanding this:

x² - 2x*sqrt(13) + 13 + y² = 169

So,

x² + y² - 2x*sqrt(13) = 156

But point A is at (0, 2√39), so OA² = 13 + (2√39)^2 = 13 + 156 = 169, which is consistent.

Now, we need to find coordinates of B and C.

Additionally, since I is the incenter, it must lie at the intersection of the angle bisectors.

But since points B and C are symmetric across the x-axis, the triangle is symmetric about the x-axis. Therefore, the incenter I, which is at (0,0), lies on the x-axis, which is consistent with our setup.

Given the symmetry, the inradius is 6, which is the distance from I to any side. Since the triangle is symmetric about the x-axis, the distance from I to BC, AB, and AC will all be equal to 6.

Wait, but BC is a vertical line at x = x. Wait, no, BC is the line connecting (x, y) and (x, -y), so it's the vertical line x = x.

So, the distance from I (0,0) to BC is |x - 0| = |x|. Therefore, |x| = 6, since the inradius is 6. So, x = 6 or x = -6.

But in our coordinate system, point A is at (0, 2√39), which is above the x-axis. Points B and C are on either side of the y-axis? Or on the same side?

Wait, no. Since BC is vertical, and the triangle is symmetric about the x-axis, but point A is on the y-axis. So, points B and C are on either side of the y-axis? Wait, no, if they are symmetric across the x-axis, their x-coordinates are the same, but y-coordinates are negatives.

Wait, but if BC is vertical, then regardless of the x-coordinate, the line is x = constant.

Wait, but the distance from I (0,0) to BC is |x| = 6, so x = 6 or x = -6.

But in our case, point A is at (0, 2√39), which is above the x-axis, and the circumcircle is centered at (sqrt(13), 0). So, point B is at (6, y) and C is at (6, -y) or (-6, y) and (-6, -y).

Wait, let's test x = 6 first.

Case 1: x = 6

So, points B and C are at (6, y) and (6, -y). Let's plug into the circumcircle equation:

(6 - sqrt(13))² + y² = 169

Compute (6 - sqrt(13))²:

= 36 - 12*sqrt(13) + 13

= 49 - 12*sqrt(13)

So,

49 - 12*sqrt(13) + y² = 169

Therefore,

y² = 169 - 49 + 12*sqrt(13)

= 120 + 12*sqrt(13)

So, y = sqrt(120 + 12*sqrt(13))

Hmm, that's a bit messy. Alternatively, maybe x = -6.

Case 2: x = -6

Points B and C are at (-6, y) and (-6, -y). Plug into circumcircle equation:

(-6 - sqrt(13))² + y² = 169

Compute (-6 - sqrt(13))²:

= 36 + 12*sqrt(13) + 13

= 49 + 12*sqrt(13)

Thus,

49 + 12*sqrt(13) + y² = 169

So,

y² = 169 - 49 - 12*sqrt(13)

= 120 - 12*sqrt(13)

So, y = sqrt(120 - 12*sqrt(13))

Which is also messy, but perhaps manageable.

So, now, depending on whether x is 6 or -6, we get two different y values.

Now, let's analyze.

If x = 6, then points B and C are at (6, y) and (6, -y), where y = sqrt(120 + 12√13). Similarly, if x = -6, then y = sqrt(120 - 12√13).

But in either case, we can calculate the lengths AB and AC.

Point A is at (0, 2√39), and point B is at (6, y). So, distance AB is sqrt[(6 - 0)^2 + (y - 2√39)^2].

Similarly, distance AC is sqrt[(6 - 0)^2 + (-y - 2√39)^2] = sqrt[36 + ( - y - 2√39)^2]. But since square is same for y and -y, AB = AC.

Wait, really? Let's compute AB²:

AB² = (6)^2 + (y - 2√39)^2 = 36 + y² - 4y√39 + (2√39)^2

= 36 + y² - 4y√39 + 4*39

= 36 + y² - 4y√39 + 156

= y² - 4y√39 + 192

Similarly, AC² would be same as AB² because replacing y with -y:

AC² = 36 + (-y - 2√39)^2 = 36 + y² + 4y√39 + 156 = same as AB², but wait, the cross term becomes positive.

Wait, hold on, let's recalculate:

AC² = (6)^2 + (-y - 2√39)^2

= 36 + (y + 2√39)^2

= 36 + y² + 4y√39 + 156

= y² + 4y√39 + 192

So, AB² and AC² are not the same. So, AB ≠ AC unless y = 0, which is not the case.

So, in fact, AB and AC are different unless y = 0.

So, in Case 1: x = 6, y = sqrt(120 + 12√13). So, AB² = y² - 4y√39 + 192

Plug in y² = 120 + 12√13:

AB² = (120 + 12√13) - 4y√39 + 192

= 312 + 12√13 - 4y√39

Similarly, AC² = y² + 4y√39 + 192

= 120 + 12√13 + 4y√39 + 192

= 312 + 12√13 + 4y√39

So, AB² and AC² are different.

But we need AB * AC.

Wait, maybe I can compute AB² * AC² and take square root.

Because (AB * AC)^2 = AB² * AC².

So, let's compute AB² * AC²:

= [312 + 12√13 - 4y√39] * [312 + 12√13 + 4y√39]

Notice that this is of the form (M - N)(M + N) = M² - N².

Where M = 312 + 12√13, N = 4y√39.

Therefore,

AB² * AC² = (312 + 12√13)^2 - (4y√39)^2

Compute each part:

First, (312 + 12√13)^2:

= 312² + 2*312*12√13 + (12√13)^2

Compute each term:

312²: 312*312. Let me compute 300² + 2*300*12 + 12² = 90000 + 7200 + 144 = 97344

Wait, actually, 312*312: 300² = 90000, 12² = 144, and cross term 2*300*12 = 7200. So, total is 90000 + 7200 + 144 = 97344.

2*312*12√13: 2*312*12 = 7488, so 7488√13.

(12√13)^2: 144*13 = 1872.

Therefore, adding together:

97344 + 7488√13 + 1872 = 97344 + 1872 = 99216; so, 99216 + 7488√13.

Next, (4y√39)^2 = 16y²*39 = 624y².

From earlier, y² = 120 + 12√13.

So, 624y² = 624*(120 + 12√13) = 624*120 + 624*12√13.

Calculate:

624*120: 624*100=62400, 624*20=12480; total=62400+12480=74880

624*12√13: 624*12=7488, so 7488√13.

Thus, (4y√39)^2 = 74880 + 7488√13.

Therefore, AB² * AC² = (99216 + 7488√13) - (74880 + 7488√13) =

99216 - 74880 + 7488√13 - 7488√13 =

24336 + 0 = 24336.

Therefore, AB² * AC² = 24336.

Taking square root: AB * AC = sqrt(24336).

What is sqrt(24336)?

Well, 150² = 22500, 160²=25600, so it's between 150 and 160.

Compute 156²: 156*156.

150²=22500, 6²=36, 2*150*6=1800, so (150+6)²=22500 + 1800 + 36=24336.

So, sqrt(24336)=156.

Therefore, AB * AC = 156.

Wow, that was a lot!

**Final Answer**
\boxed{156}
</think>

Given triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with circumcenter \( O \) and incenter \( I \), where \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \), circumradius \( R = 13 \), and inradius \( r = 6 \). We need to find \( AB \cdot AC \).

1. **Distance between Incenter and Circumcenter**:
   Using the formula \( OI^2 = R(R - 2r) \):
   \[
   OI^2 = 13^2 - 2 \cdot 13 \cdot 6 = 169 - 156 = 13
   \]
   Thus, \( OI = \sqrt{13} \).

2. **Coordinate System Setup**:
   Place \( I \) at the origin \((0,0)\) and \( O \) at \((\sqrt{13}, 0)\). Point \( A \) is at \((0, h)\) since \( IA \) is perpendicular to \( OI \).

3. **Distance from \( I \) to \( A \)**:
   Given \( OI = \sqrt{13} \) and \( OA = 13 \):
   \[
   OA^2 = 13 + h^2 = 169 \implies h^2 = 156 \implies h = 2\sqrt{39}
   \]
   Thus, point \( A \) is at \((0, 2\sqrt{39})\).

4. **Coordinates of Points \( B \) and \( C \)**:
   Points \( B \) and \( C \) lie on the circumcircle centered at \((\sqrt{13}, 0)\) with radius 13. Assume symmetry and denote \( B \) as \((x, y)\) and \( C \) as \((x, -y)\).

5. **Equation of Circumcircle**:
   Substituting \( B \) into the circumcircle equation:
   \[
   (x - \sqrt{13})^2 + y^2 = 169
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   x^2 + y^2 - 2x\sqrt{13} = 156
   \]

6. **Distance from Incenter to Sides**:
   The distance from \( I \) to side \( BC \) is 6, giving \( |x| = 6 \). Thus, \( x = 6 \) or \( x = -6 \).

7. **Calculating \( y \)**:
   For \( x = 6 \):
   \[
   (6 - \sqrt{13})^2 + y^2 = 169 \implies y^2 = 120 + 12\sqrt{13}
   \]
   For \( x = -6 \):
   \[
   (-6 - \sqrt{13})^2 + y^2 = 169 \implies y^2 = 120 - 12\sqrt{13}
   \]

8. **Distances \( AB \) and \( AC \)**:
   Calculate \( AB \) and \( AC \) using coordinates:
   \[
   AB^2 = 36 + (y - 2\sqrt{39})^2
   \]
   \[
   AC^2 = 36 + (-y - 2\sqrt{39})^2
   \]

9. **Product \( AB \cdot AC \)**:
   Using the product of distances:
   \[
   (AB \cdot AC)^2 = (312 + 12\sqrt{13} - 4y\sqrt{39})(312 + 12\sqrt{13} + 4y\sqrt{39})
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   (AB \cdot AC)^2 = 24336 \implies AB \cdot AC = \sqrt{24336} = 156
   \]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{156}
\]
