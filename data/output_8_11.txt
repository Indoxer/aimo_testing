 The problem: 
In isosceles trapezoid $ABCD$, parallel bases $\overline{AB}$ and $\overline{CD}$ have lengths $500$ and $650$, respectively, and $AD=BC=333$. The angle bisectors of $\angle{A}$ and $\angle{D}$ meet at $P$, and the angle bisectors of $\angle{B}$ and $\angle{C}$ meet at $Q$. Find $PQ$.


To solve for the length \(PQ\) in the isosceles trapezoid \(ABCD\), we start by analyzing the geometry of the trapezoid. The bases are \(AB = 500\) and \(CD = 650\), and the non-parallel sides are \(AD = BC = 333\).

First, we drop perpendiculars from points \(A\) and \(B\) to line \(CD\), meeting \(CD\) at points \(E\) and \(F\) respectively. This creates two right triangles \(ADE\) and \(BCF\) with \(DE = CF\) and \(EF = AB = 500\). Since \(CD = 650\), we have:
\[DE + EF + CF = CD \implies DE + 500 + DE = 650 \implies 2DE = 150 \implies DE = 75.\]
Thus, \(DE = CF = 75\).

Now, we can find the height \(h\) of the trapezoid using the Pythagorean theorem in triangle \(ADE\):
\[AD^2 = DE^2 + h^2 \implies 333^2 = 75^2 + h^2 \implies 110889 = 5625 + h^2 \implies h^2 = 105264 \implies h = \sqrt{105264} = 324.\]

Next, we need to find the coordinates of points \(P\) and \(Q\). The angle bisectors of \(\angle A\) and \(\angle D\) meet at point \(P\), and the angle bisectors of \(\angle B\) and \(\angle C\) meet at point \(Q\). In an isosceles trapezoid, the intersection of the angle bisectors of the non-parallel sides is the midpoint of the segment joining the midpoints of the bases. The midpoints of \(AB\) and \(CD\) are \((250, 0)\) and \((625, 0)\) respectively, and the distance between these midpoints is:
\[625 - 250 = 375.\]
Since \(P\) and \(Q\) are the same point (the intersection of the angle bisectors), the length \(PQ\) is half of this distance:
\[PQ = \frac{375}{2} = 187.5.\]

Thus, the length of \(PQ\) is:
\[\boxed{187.5}.\]
