 The problem: 
Let $S$ be the set of all rational numbers that can be expressed as a repeating decimal in the form $0.\overline{abcd},$ where at least one of the digits $a,$ $b,$ $c,$ or $d$ is nonzero. Let $N$ be the number of distinct numerators obtained when numbers in $S$ are written as fractions in lowest terms. For example, both $4$ and $410$ are counted among the distinct numerators for numbers in $S$ because $0.\overline{3636} = \frac{4}{11}$ and $0.\overline{1230} = \frac{410}{3333}.$ Find the remainder when $N$ is divided by $1000.$


To solve this problem, we need to understand the structure of the repeating decimals and their corresponding fractions. A repeating decimal of the form \(0.\overline{abcd}\) can be expressed as a fraction:

\[0.\overline{abcd} = \frac{abcd}{9999},\]

where \(abcd\) is the four-digit number formed by the digits \(a, b, c, d\). This fraction can be simplified to its lowest terms by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \(abcd\) and 9999. The number 9999 can be factored into primes as follows:

\[9999 = 3^2 \times 11 \times 101.\]

Thus, the fraction \(\frac{abcd}{9999}\) will be in its lowest terms if the GCD of \(abcd\) and 9999 is 1. This means that \(abcd\) must not be divisible by 3, 11, or 101.

First, we count the total number of four-digit numbers, which is 9000 (from 1000 to 9999). We then subtract the numbers that are divisible by 3, 11, or 101.

Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, we calculate the number of four-digit numbers divisible by 3, 11, or 101:

- The number of four-digit numbers divisible by 3 is \(\left\lfloor \frac{9999}{3} \right\rfloor - \left\lfloor \frac{999}{3} \right\rfloor = 3333 - 333 = 3000\).
- The number of four-digit numbers divisible by 11 is \(\left\lfloor \frac{9999}{11} \right\rfloor - \left\lfloor \frac{999}{11} \right\rfloor = 909 - 90 = 819\).
- The number of four-digit numbers divisible by 101 is \(\left\lfloor \frac{9999}{101} \right\rfloor - \left\lfloor \frac{999}{101} \right\rfloor = 99 - 9 = 90\).
- The number of four-digit numbers divisible by \(3 \times 11 = 33\) is \(\left\lfloor \frac{9999}{33} \right\rfloor - \left\lfloor \frac{999}{33} \right\rfloor = 303 - 30 = 273\).
- The number of four-digit numbers divisible by \(3 \times 101 = 303\) is \(\left\lfloor \frac{9999}{303} \right\rfloor - \left\lfloor \frac{999}{303} \right\rfloor = 33 - 3 = 30\).
- The number of four-digit numbers divisible by \(11 \times 101 = 1111\) is \(\left\lfloor \frac{9999}{1111} \right\rfloor - \left\lfloor \frac{999}{1111} \right\rfloor = 9 - 0 = 9\).
- The number of four-digit numbers divisible by \(3 \times 11 \times 101 = 3333\) is \(\left\lfloor \frac{9999}{3333} \right\rfloor - \left\lfloor \frac{999}{3333} \right\rfloor = 3 - 0 = 3\).

So, the number of four-digit numbers divisible by 3, 11, or 101 is:

\[3000 + 819 + 90 - 273 - 30 - 9 + 3 = 3600.\]

Therefore, the number of four-digit numbers that are not divisible by 3, 11, or 101 is:

\[9000 - 3600 = 5400.\]

These are the numbers \(abcd\) that can be the numerators of the fractions in their lowest terms. Thus, the number of distinct numerators is 5400. The remainder when 5400 is divided by 1000 is:

\[\boxed{400}.\]
