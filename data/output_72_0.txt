 The problem: 
Find the largest possible real part of \[(75+117i)z+\frac{96+144i}{z}\]where $z$ is a complex number with $|z|=4$.


Alright, so I've got this problem here where I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression \((75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\), and \(z\) is a complex number with \(|z| = 4\). Hmm, okay. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First off, since \(z\) is a complex number with magnitude 4, that means \(z\) can be represented as \(4e^{i\theta}\), right? Because any complex number on the circle with radius 4 can be written in polar form like that, where \(\theta\) is the argument (or angle) of \(z\). So, maybe I can substitute \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\) into the expression and see what happens.

Let's write that out:

\[
(75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z} = (75 + 117i)(4e^{i\theta}) + \frac{96 + 144i}{4e^{i\theta}}
\]

Simplify each term separately. Starting with the first term:

\[
(75 + 117i)(4e^{i\theta}) = 4(75 + 117i)e^{i\theta}
\]

And the second term:

\[
\frac{96 + 144i}{4e^{i\theta}} = \frac{24 + 36i}{e^{i\theta}} = (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta}
\]

So now our expression becomes:

\[
4(75 + 117i)e^{i\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta}
\]

Hmm, okay. So we have two terms involving \(e^{i\theta}\) and \(e^{-i\theta}\). Maybe it would help if I represent these complex numbers in their rectangular forms or perhaps convert them to polar form for easier manipulation.

Wait, actually, another approach could be to note that both terms are complex conjugates multiplied by some constants. But before that, let me think about representing everything in terms of sine and cosine.

Since \(e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta\), and similarly, \(e^{-i\theta} = \cos\theta - i\sin\theta\), substituting these into our expression might make it easier to separate the real and imaginary parts.

Let me try that.

First, compute \(4(75 + 117i)e^{i\theta}\):

Multiply through:

\(4 \times 75 = 300\)

\(4 \times 117 = 468\)

So, \(4(75 + 117i) = 300 + 468i\)

Multiplying this by \(e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta\):

\[
(300 + 468i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta)
\]

Using distributive property:

\[
300\cos\theta + 300i\sin\theta + 468i\cos\theta + 468i^2\sin\theta
\]

Remembering that \(i^2 = -1\), so the last term becomes \(-468\sin\theta\).

Now, combining like terms:

Real parts: \(300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta\)

Imaginary parts: \(300\sin\theta + 468\cos\theta\)

So, the first term simplifies to:

\[
(300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta) + i(300\sin\theta + 468\cos\theta)
\]

Similarly, let's process the second term: \((24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta}\)

Again, \(e^{-i\theta} = \cos\theta - i\sin\theta\), so:

\[
(24 + 36i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta)
\]

Distribute:

\[
24\cos\theta - 24i\sin\theta + 36i\cos\theta - 36i^2\sin\theta
\]

Simplify with \(i^2 = -1\):

Real parts: \(24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta\)

Imaginary parts: \(-24\sin\theta + 36\cos\theta\)

Therefore, the second term becomes:

\[
(24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta) + i(-24\sin\theta + 36\cos\theta)
\]

Okay, so now, combining both terms together, the entire expression is:

First term + Second term:

Real parts:

\[
(300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta) + (24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta) = (300 + 24)\cos\theta + (-468 + 36)\sin\theta = 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta
\]

Imaginary parts:

\[
(300\sin\theta + 468\cos\theta) + (-24\sin\theta + 36\cos\theta) = (300 - 24)\sin\theta + (468 + 36)\cos\theta = 276\sin\theta + 504\cos\theta
\]

So, putting it all together, the expression is:

\[
(324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta) + i(276\sin\theta + 504\cos\theta)
\]

But wait, the problem asks for the real part of this entire expression. So, the real part is just \(324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta\). Therefore, we need to maximize this real part.

So, we're looking for the maximum value of:

\[
R(\theta) = 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta
\]

Alright, so this is a function of \(\theta\), which we can maximize using calculus or trigonometric identities. Let me recall that expressions of the form \(A\cos\theta + B\sin\theta\) can be rewritten as \(C\cos(\theta + \phi)\) where \(C = \sqrt{A^2 + B^2}\) and \(\phi\) is some phase shift. The maximum value of such an expression is simply \(C\), since the maximum of \(\cos\) function is 1.

So, applying that here, let me write \(R(\theta)\) as:

\[
R(\theta) = A\cos\theta + B\sin\theta
\]

where \(A = 324\) and \(B = -432\).

Then, the amplitude \(C\) is:

\[
C = \sqrt{A^2 + B^2} = \sqrt{324^2 + (-432)^2}
\]

Compute \(324^2\):

Well, 324 is 18*18, but squared is 104,976.

Similarly, 432^2: Let's compute 400^2 = 160,000, plus 32^2=1,024, plus cross terms 2*400*32=25,600. So, total is 160,000 + 25,600 + 1,024 = 186,624. Wait, no, hold on. Actually, 432 is 400 + 32, so squared is 400² + 2*400*32 + 32² = 160,000 + 25,600 + 1,024 = 186,624.

So, \(C = \sqrt{104,976 + 186,624} = \sqrt{291,600}\).

What's the square root of 291,600?

Well, 540^2 = 291,600 because 500^2 = 250,000, 540^2 = (500 + 40)^2 = 500² + 2*500*40 + 40² = 250,000 + 40,000 + 1,600 = 291,600.

Yes, so \(C = 540\).

Therefore, the maximum value of \(R(\theta)\) is 540.

Wait, so does that mean the maximum real part is 540? That seems straightforward, but let me verify my steps to ensure I didn't make a mistake.

First, starting from the original expression:

\[
(75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}
\]

with \(|z| = 4\). So, substituted \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\), then expressed both terms in terms of \(\theta\), expanded them, separated into real and imaginary parts, added them up, and ended up with a real part of \(324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta\). Then, recognizing that this is a sinusoidal function whose maximum is its amplitude, which was calculated as 540.

That seems correct.

Alternatively, another method is to use the concept of phasors or vector addition. Since \(R(\theta)\) is a linear combination of sine and cosine, it can be represented as a single sinusoid with amplitude equal to the square root of the sum of squares of coefficients, which we did, resulting in 540.

Just to double-check, maybe I can compute \(A^2 + B^2\):

\(324^2 = (300 + 24)^2 = 300^2 + 2*300*24 + 24^2 = 90,000 + 14,400 + 576 = 104,976\)

\( (-432)^2 = 432^2 = (400 + 32)^2 = 400^2 + 2*400*32 + 32^2 = 160,000 + 25,600 + 1,024 = 186,624\)

Adding those together: 104,976 + 186,624 = 291,600

Square root of 291,600 is indeed 540, since 540^2 is 291,600.

So yes, that checks out.

Alternatively, another approach is to consider writing the expression in terms of \(w = z/4\), so that \(|w| = 1\). Then, substituting back, the expression becomes:

\[
(75 + 117i)(4w) + \frac{96 + 144i}{4w} = 4(75 + 117i)w + \frac{24 + 36i}{w}
\]

Which is similar to what I had earlier, except scaled down by 4. But anyway, regardless of substitution, the key point is that when dealing with \(|z| = r\), expressing \(z\) as \(r e^{i\theta}\) is a standard technique.

Another thought: Perhaps instead of converting to polar form, I could treat this as a function over the complex plane and attempt to maximize the real part using calculus. Let me explore that avenue too, just to confirm.

Let me denote \(f(z) = (75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\).

We can write \(f(z)\) as:

\[
f(z) = (75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}
\]

We need to maximize Re[f(z)] where \(|z| = 4\).

Expressed in terms of \(z = x + iy\), with \(x^2 + y^2 = 16\). Then, f(z) would be a complex expression, but taking its real part might be cumbersome. Alternatively, using calculus on complex functions can sometimes involve treating \(z\) and \(\overline{z}\) as independent variables, but I'm not sure if that applies here.

Alternatively, perhaps using Lagrange multipliers to maximize Re[f(z)] subject to \(|z| = 4\). Hmm, that might be more involved.

But since we already transformed \(z\) into polar coordinates and simplified the expression, leading us to a real part that's a simple sinusoid, it seems much simpler.

Given that, and having double-checked the calculations, I feel confident that the maximum real part is indeed 540.

Wait, hold on a second. Just thinking again, when you have an expression \(A\cos\theta + B\sin\theta\), the maximum is \(\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}\), but in our case, it's \(324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta\). So, is that still applicable?

Yes, because whether it's positive or negative doesn't affect the amplitude. So, the maximum is still \(\sqrt{324^2 + (-432)^2}\), which is 540.

Therefore, the maximum real part is 540.

Wait, but just to be thorough, let me check if there isn't a higher value somewhere else.

Suppose, for some reason, that the maximum occurs at a different \(\theta\), but given the sinusoidal nature, it should achieve its peak at some multiple of \(\pi\), so the maximum is indeed 540.

Alternatively, maybe using derivative.

Let me try that approach. If I let \(R(\theta) = 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta\), then the derivative with respect to \(\theta\) is:

\(dR/d\theta = -324\sin\theta - 432\cos\theta\)

Setting derivative equal to zero:

\[
-324\sin\theta - 432\cos\theta = 0
\]

Divide both sides by -108:

\(3\sin\theta + 4\cos\theta = 0\)

So,

\(3\sin\theta = -4\cos\theta\)

Divide both sides by \(\cos\theta\) (assuming \(\cos\theta \neq 0\)):

\(3\tan\theta = -4\)

So,

\(\tan\theta = -\frac{4}{3}\)

Thus, \(\theta = \arctan(-\frac{4}{3})\). This gives us two solutions in the interval \([0, 2\pi)\): one in the fourth quadrant and one in the second quadrant.

Calculating \(\theta = \arctan(-\frac{4}{3})\). Let me compute this.

The arctangent of \(\frac{4}{3}\) is approximately 53.13 degrees. So, arctan(-4/3) is -53.13 degrees, or equivalently, 360 - 53.13 = 306.87 degrees, or in radians, that's approximately 5.355 radians. Alternatively, in the second quadrant, it would be 180 - 53.13 = 126.87 degrees, or about 2.214 radians.

So, plugging these values of \(\theta\) back into \(R(\theta)\), we can compute the corresponding R.

But wait, actually, we know from the amplitude that the maximum value is 540, so it must occur at one of these critical points. Let me compute \(R(\theta)\) at \(\theta = \arctan(-4/3)\), but in the correct quadrant.

But perhaps instead of computing numerically, let's express \(\sin\theta\) and \(\cos\theta\) in terms of the triangle.

Given \(\tan\theta = -4/3\), we can imagine a right triangle with opposite side -4 (negative because tangent is negative) and adjacent side 3. Then, the hypotenuse would be 5 (since 3-4-5 triangle). Therefore, \(\sin\theta = -4/5\) and \(\cos\theta = 3/5\), but we have to consider the quadrant.

Since \(\tan\theta = -4/3\), \(\theta\) is in either the second or fourth quadrant.

Case 1: \(\theta\) in the fourth quadrant: cos(theta) positive, sin(theta) negative.

So, \(\cos\theta = 3/5\), \(\sin\theta = -4/5\)

Case 2: \(\theta\) in the second quadrant: cos(theta) negative, sin(theta) positive.

So, \(\cos\theta = -3/5\), \(\sin\theta = 4/5\)

Plugging these into R(theta):

Case 1: \(324*(3/5) - 432*(-4/5) = (972/5) + (1728/5) = (972 + 1728)/5 = 2700/5 = 540\)

Case 2: \(324*(-3/5) - 432*(4/5) = (-972/5) - (1728/5) = (-2700)/5 = -540\)

So, indeed, at the critical points, R(theta) reaches 540 and -540. Hence, the maximum is 540, and the minimum is -540.

Therefore, confirming that the maximum real part is 540.

Alternatively, another way is to consider the expression:

\(R(\theta) = 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta\)

We can rewrite this as:

\(R(\theta) = 540 \left( \frac{324}{540}\cos\theta - \frac{432}{540}\sin\theta \right) = 540 \left( \frac{3}{5}\cos\theta - \frac{4}{5}\sin\theta \right)\)

Notice that \(\frac{3}{5}\) and \(\frac{4}{5}\) are the cosine and sine of some angle phi, specifically phi = arctan(4/3). So, we can write:

\(R(\theta) = 540 \left( \cos\phi \cos\theta - \sin\phi \sin\theta \right ) = 540 \cos(\theta + \phi)\)

Hence, the maximum value is 540, achieved when \(\cos(\theta + \phi) = 1\), i.e., when theta + phi = 0 mod 2π.

This also aligns with our previous findings.

Therefore, after multiple approaches—using trigonometric identities, derivatives, and even substitution—it consistently shows that the maximum real part is 540.

I think that's solid. Unless I made a calculation mistake somewhere, but checking the math, all steps seem consistent.

**Final Answer**
The largest possible real part is \boxed{540}.
</think>

Given the problem of finding the largest possible real part of the expression \((75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\) where \(z\) is a complex number with \(|z| = 4\), we start by representing \(z\) as \(4e^{i\theta}\).

Substituting \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\) into the expression, we get:
\[
(75 + 117i)(4e^{i\theta}) + \frac{96 + 144i}{4e^{i\theta}}
\]

Simplifying each term separately:
1. \((75 + 117i)(4e^{i\theta}) = 4(75 + 117i)e^{i\theta} = (300 + 468i)e^{i\theta}\)
2. \(\frac{96 + 144i}{4e^{i\theta}} = (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta}\)

Expanding these using Euler's formula \(e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta\) and \(e^{-i\theta} = \cos\theta - i\sin\theta\):
- The first term becomes: \((300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta) + i(300\sin\theta + 468\cos\theta)\)
- The second term becomes: \((24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta) + i(-24\sin\theta + 36\cos\theta)\)

Combining the real parts:
\[
(300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta) + (24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta) = 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta
\]

To find the maximum value of \(324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta\), we recognize it as a sinusoidal function. The maximum value of \(A\cos\theta + B\sin\theta\) is \(\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}\):
\[
\sqrt{324^2 + (-432)^2} = \sqrt{104976 + 186624} = \sqrt{291600} = 540
\]

Thus, the largest possible real part is \(\boxed{540}\).
