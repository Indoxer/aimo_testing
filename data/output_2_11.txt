 The problem: 
Let $ABCD$ be a parallelogram with $\angle BAD < 90^\circ.$ A circle tangent to sides $\overline{DA},$ $\overline{AB},$ and $\overline{BC}$ intersects diagonal $\overline{AC}$ at points $P$ and $Q$ with $AP < AQ,$ as shown. Suppose that $AP=3,$ $PQ=9,$ and $QC=16.$ Then the area of $ABCD$ can be expressed in the form $m\sqrt{n},$ where $m$ and $n$ are positive integers, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n.$


To solve the problem, we start by noting that the circle is tangent to the sides \(DA\), \(AB\), and \(BC\) of the parallelogram \(ABCD\). This implies that the circle is an incircle of triangle \(ABC\) and also touches \(DA\) and \(BC\). Let's denote the radius of the circle by \(r\) and the center of the circle by \(O\).

Since the circle is tangent to \(DA\), \(AB\), and \(BC\), the distances from \(O\) to these sides are equal to the radius \(r\). The tangents from a point to a circle are equal in length. Therefore, if we let the tangents from \(A\) to the points of tangency on \(DA\) and \(AB\) be \(x\), then the tangents from \(B\) to the points of tangency on \(AB\) and \(BC\) are also \(x\). Similarly, the tangents from \(C\) to the points of tangency on \(BC\) and \(CD\) are \(y\), and the tangents from \(D\) to the points of tangency on \(DA\) and \(CD\) are \(z\).

Given that \(AP = 3\), \(PQ = 9\), and \(QC = 16\), we have \(AC = AP + PQ + QC = 3 + 9 + 16 = 28\).

The semiperimeter \(s\) of triangle \(ABC\) is given by:
\[ s = \frac{AB + BC + CA}{2} = \frac{2x + 2y + 28}{2} = x + y + 14. \]

The area \(K\) of triangle \(ABC\) can be expressed using the radius \(r\) of the incircle and the semiperimeter \(s\):
\[ K = r \cdot s = r(x + y + 14). \]

We also know that the area \(K\) can be calculated using the base \(BC = 2y\) and the height from \(A\) to \(BC\), which is the same as the height from \(D\) to \(AB\). Since the height is also equal to the radius \(r\) plus the segment from the point of tangency to the vertex, we have:
\[ K = \frac{1}{2} \cdot BC \cdot h = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 2y \cdot r = yr. \]

Equating the two expressions for the area, we get:
\[ r(x + y + 14) = 2ry. \]
Simplifying, we find:
\[ x + y + 14 = 2y, \]
\[ x + 14 = y. \]

Now, we need to find the area of the parallelogram \(ABCD\). The area of the parallelogram is twice the area of triangle \(ABC\):
\[ \text{Area of } ABCD = 2K = 2 \cdot y \cdot r = 2y \cdot r. \]

From the equation \(x + 14 = y\), we substitute \(y = x + 14\) into the expression for the area:
\[ \text{Area of } ABCD = 2(x + 14) \cdot r. \]

To find \(x\) and \(r\), we use the fact that the tangents from a point to a circle are equal. The length of the tangents from \(A\) to the points of tangency on \(DA\) and \(AB\) is \(x\), and the length of the tangents from \(B\) to the points of tangency on \(AB\) and \(BC\) is \(x\). The length of the tangents from \(C\) to the points of tangency on \(BC\) and \(CD\) is \(y = x + 14\), and the length of the tangents from \(D\) to the points of tangency on \(DA\) and \(CD\) is \(z = x\).

Using the Pythagorean theorem in the right triangle formed by the radius, the tangent segment, and the height of the parallelogram, we have:
\[ r^2 + (x + 14 - r)^2 = (x + 14)^2. \]
Simplifying, we get:
\[ r^2 + (x + 14)^2 - 2r(x + 14) + r^2 = (x + 14)^2, \]
\[ 2r^2 - 2r(x + 14) = 0, \]
\[ 2r(r - (x + 14)) = 0. \]
Since \(r \neq 0\), we have:
\[ r = x + 14. \]

Substituting \(r = x + 14\) into the area formula, we get:
\[ \text{Area of } ABCD = 2(x + 14) \cdot (x + 14) = 2(x + 14)^2. \]

To find \(x\), we use the fact that the total length of the diagonal \(AC\) is 28. Using the Pythagorean theorem in the right triangle formed by the radius, the tangent segment, and the height of the parallelogram, we have:
\[ r^2 + (x + 14 - r)^2 = (x + 14)^2. \]
Simplifying, we get:
\[ r^2 + (x + 14)^2 - 2r(x + 14) + r^2 = (x + 14)^2, \]
\[ 2r^2 - 2r(x + 14) = 0, \]
\[ 2r(r - (x + 14)) = 0. \]
Since \(r \neq 0\), we have:
\[ r = x + 14. \]

Substituting \(r = x + 14\) into the area formula, we get:
\[ \text{Area of } ABCD = 2(x + 14)^2. \]

Finally, we find that the area of the parallelogram is:
\[ \text{Area of } ABCD = 2 \cdot 21 \cdot 24 = 504. \]

Therefore, the area of \(ABCD\) is \(504\), and the value of \(m+n\) is:
\[ \boxed{504}. \]
