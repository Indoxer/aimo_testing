 The problem: 
For each positive integer $n$ let $a_n$ be the least positive integer multiple of $23$ such that $a_n \equiv 1 \pmod{2^n}.$ Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $1000$ that satisfy $a_n = a_{n+1}.$


Alright, so I'm trying to solve this problem where for each positive integer \( n \), \( a_n \) is defined as the least positive integer multiple of 23 such that \( a_n \equiv 1 \pmod{2^n} \). We need to find how many positive integers \( n \) less than or equal to 1000 satisfy \( a_n = a_{n+1} \).

First off, let me parse the problem. For each \( n \), we're looking for the smallest multiple of 23 that leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by \( 2^n \). So, \( a_n \) is essentially the minimal solution to the congruence equation \( 23k \equiv 1 \pmod{2^n} \).

I remember that solving linear congruences like \( ax \equiv b \pmod{m} \) can be done using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, provided that \( a \) and \( m \) are coprime. In this case, \( a = 23 \) and \( m = 2^n \). Since 23 is odd and \( 2^n \) is a power of two, their greatest common divisor is 1. So, there should be a unique solution modulo \( 2^n \).

Therefore, \( a_n \) exists and is unique modulo \( 2^n \). Since we want the least positive multiple, it will be the smallest positive integer satisfying the congruence.

Now, the key part here is figuring out when \( a_n = a_{n+1} \). That would mean that the solution \( a_n \) modulo \( 2^{n} \) is also a solution modulo \( 2^{n+1} \). In other words, \( a_n \) must be congruent to 1 modulo \( 2^{n+1} \), because if \( a_n \) is 1 mod \( 2^{n+1} \), then it's automatically 1 mod \( 2^n \).

But wait, actually, no. If \( a_n = a_{n+1} \), then \( a_n \) must satisfy both \( a_n \equiv 1 \pmod{2^n} \) and \( a_n \equiv 1 \pmod{2^{n+1}} \). But since \( 2^{n+1} \) is a stricter condition, meaning it's more restrictive, if \( a_n \equiv 1 \pmod{2^{n+1}} \), then certainly \( a_n \equiv 1 \pmod{2^n} \). Conversely, if \( a_n \equiv 1 \pmod{2^{n+1}} \), then \( a_n \) is the same modulo \( 2^{n+1} \) as \( a_{n+1} \) is, but since \( a_{n+1} \) is the minimal solution modulo \( 2^{n+1} \), they have to be equal. So, yes, \( a_n = a_{n+1} \) happens exactly when \( a_n \equiv 1 \pmod{2^{n+1}} \).

So, our task reduces to finding all \( n \leq 1000 \) such that \( a_n \equiv 1 \pmod{2^{n+1}} \). Alternatively, the minimal solution \( a_n \) modulo \( 2^{n} \) lifts to the same value modulo \( 2^{n+1} \). This likely relates to Hensel's Lemma in modular arithmetic, which tells us about lifting solutions from modulo \( p^k \) to \( p^{k+1} \).

Given that 23 is invertible modulo any power of 2 (since it's odd), perhaps we can use some properties of multiplicative inverses here.

Let me think about how the inverse of 23 modulo \( 2^n \) behaves as \( n \) increases. If we know the inverse modulo \( 2^n \), can we express the inverse modulo \( 2^{n+1} \)?

Yes, there's a way to lift the inverse from \( 2^n \) to \( 2^{n+1} \) using the fact that if \( x \) is the inverse of 23 modulo \( 2^n \), then the inverse modulo \( 2^{n+1} \) can be found by \( x' = x - (23x - 1) \cdot x \mod 2^{n+1} \) or something similar? Wait, maybe I need to recall the exact formula.

Actually, the standard method for lifting solutions modulo higher powers of primes (in this case, prime 2) is given by Hensel's Lemma. For lifting an inverse, if \( x \) is the inverse of \( a \) modulo \( 2^n \), then the inverse modulo \( 2^{n+1} \) is \( x + k \cdot 2^n \), where \( k \) is chosen such that \( (x + k \cdot 2^n) \cdot a \equiv 1 \mod 2^{n+1} \).

So, let's compute this step-by-step. Let me denote \( a = 23 \). Suppose that \( x \) is the inverse of \( a \) modulo \( 2^n \), i.e., \( a x \equiv 1 \mod 2^n \). Then, to find the inverse modulo \( 2^{n+1} \), we set \( x' = x + k \cdot 2^n \), where \( k \) satisfies:

\( a(x + k \cdot 2^n) \equiv 1 \mod 2^{n+1} \)

Expanding this, we get:

\( a x + a k \cdot 2^n \equiv 1 \mod 2^{n+1} \)

We know that \( a x \equiv 1 \mod 2^n \), so \( a x = 1 + m \cdot 2^n \) for some integer \( m \). Substituting back:

\( 1 + m \cdot 2^n + a k \cdot 2^n \equiv 1 \mod 2^{n+1} \)

Subtracting 1 from both sides:

\( (m + a k) \cdot 2^n \equiv 0 \mod 2^{n+1} \)

Dividing both sides by \( 2^n \):

\( m + a k \equiv 0 \mod 2 \)

Since \( 2^{n} \) divides \( 2^n \), so we're left with:

\( m + a k \equiv 0 \mod 2 \)

Recall that \( a = 23 \equiv 1 \mod 2 \), so \( a \equiv 1 \mod 2 \). Therefore, the equation simplifies to:

\( m + k \equiv 0 \mod 2 \)

Thus, \( k \equiv -m \mod 2 \). So, \( k \) is either 0 or 1 modulo 2, depending on whether \( m \) is even or odd.

But \( m \) comes from \( a x = 1 + m \cdot 2^n \). So, \( m = \frac{a x - 1}{2^n} \). Since \( a x \equiv 1 \mod 2^n \), \( m \) is an integer. To find \( k \), we just need to check if \( m \) is even or odd.

Wait, maybe instead of getting bogged down in general terms, I can try to compute \( a_n \) modulo increasing powers of 2 and see when \( a_n \) remains congruent to 1 modulo the next power.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to observe that the multiplicative order of 23 modulo \( 2^n \) might play a role here. However, since 23 is congruent to 11 mod 16, which has order 2 modulo 16, but let me check.

Wait, actually, in the multiplicative group modulo \( 2^n \), the structure is well-known. For \( n \geq 3 \), the multiplicative group modulo \( 2^n \) is isomorphic to the cyclic group \( C_2 \times C_{2^{n-2}}} \). So, elements have orders dividing \( 2^{n-1} } \). Hmm, maybe not directly helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps using the concept of the 2-adic inverse. Since 23 is invertible modulo \( 2^n \), its inverse can be expressed as a 2-adic integer. The question is when does this inverse stabilize when moving from \( n \) to \( n+1 \); that is, when adding another bit doesn't change the inverse.

But maybe stepping back, let's compute \( a_n \) explicitly for small values of \( n \) and see if we can spot a pattern.

Starting with \( n = 1 \):
We need the least multiple of 23 that is 1 mod 2. Well, any odd number is 1 mod 2, and 23 itself is odd, so \( a_1 = 23 \).

For \( n = 2 \):
We need the least multiple of 23 that is 1 mod 4. So, starting from 23:
23 mod 4 is 3. So, 23 * 1 ≡ 3 mod 4
23 * 2 = 46, which is 2 mod 4
23 * 3 = 69, which is 1 mod 4
So, \( a_2 = 69 \).

Check if \( a_1 = a_2 \)? 23 ≠ 69, so no.

For \( n = 3 \):
Find the least multiple of 23 that is 1 mod 8.

Compute multiples of 69 (which was \( a_2 \)):
69 mod 8 is 5. So,
69 * 1 = 69 ≡ 5 mod 8
69 * 2 = 138 ≡ 2 mod 8
69 * 3 = 207 ≡ 7 mod 8
69 * 4 = 276 ≡ 4 mod 8
69 * 5 = 345 ≡ 1 mod 8
So, \( a_3 = 345 \).

Check if \( a_2 = a_3 \)? 69 ≠ 345, so no.

For \( n = 4 \):
Find the least multiple of 23 that is 1 mod 16.

We can use \( a_3 = 345 \) and compute it mod 16:
345 / 16 = 21*16=336, so 345 ≡ 9 mod 16.

We need to find the smallest multiple of 23 that is 1 mod 16. Since 23 ≡ 7 mod 16, we need 7k ≡ 1 mod 16. The inverse of 7 mod 16 is 7, because 7*7=49≡1 mod16.

So, k=7. Thus, \( a_4 = 23*7=161 \).

Check if \( a_3 = a_4 \)? 345 vs 161. No, so move on.

For \( n = 5 \):
Find the least multiple of 23 that is 1 mod 32.

Compute \( a_4 = 161 \) mod 32:
161 /32=5*32=160, so 161≡1 mod32.

So, \( a_5 =161 \).

Wait, so \( a_4=161 \), \( a_5=161 \). So, \( a_4 = a_5 \). That's one instance.

Proceeding to \( n=6 \):
We need \( a_6 \) to be 1 mod 64.

Compute \( a_5=161 \) mod 64:
64*2=128, 161-128=33, so 161≡33 mod64.

We need to find the smallest multiple of 23 that is 1 mod64.

So, 23k ≡1 mod64.

We can write this as 23k ≡1 mod64. Let's find the inverse of 23 mod64.

Using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm:

Find integers x and y such that 23x + 64y =1.

64 = 2*23 + 18

23 = 1*18 +5

18=3*5 +3

5=1*3 +2

3=1*2 +1

2=2*1 +0

Now, backtracking:

1=3 -1*2

But 2=5 -1*3, so

1=3 -1*(5 -1*3)=2*3 -1*5

But 3=18 -3*5, so

1=2*(18 -3*5) -1*5=2*18 -7*5

But 5=23 -1*18, so

1=2*18 -7*(23 -1*18)=9*18 -7*23

But 18=64 -2*23, so

1=9*(64 -2*23) -7*23=9*64 -25*23

Therefore, -25*23 ≡1 mod64. So, the inverse is -25 mod64. Which is 64-25=39.

So, the inverse is 39. Therefore, \( a_6=23*39=897 \).

Check if \( a_5 = a_6 \)? 161 vs 897. No, so \( a_6 \neq a_5 \).

Proceeding to \( n=7 \):
Find \( a_7 \) as the least multiple of 23 that is 1 mod128.

Compute \( a_6=897 \) mod128:
128*7=896, so 897≡1 mod128.

Hence, \( a_7=897 \).

Therefore, \( a_6=a_7 \). That's another instance.

So, now we see a pattern: For \( n=5,7 \), \( a_n = a_{n+1} \).

Wait, let's verify for \( n=5 \): \( a_5=161 \), which is 1 mod32, so lifting to mod64 gives \( a_6=897 \). But \( a_6=897 \) is also 1 mod64?

Wait, 897 mod64: 64*14=896, so 897≡1 mod64. So indeed, \( a_6=897 \) is 1 mod64, which means that \( a_6 \) is already 1 mod64, so when we go to \( n=7 \), which requires 1 mod128, we need to adjust \( a_6=897 \) to see if it's 1 mod128.

Compute 897 mod128:
128*7=896, so 897≡1 mod128. Hence, \( a_7=897 \).

Similarly, proceeding to \( n=8 \):
Find \( a_8 \) as the least multiple of23 that is1 mod256.

Compute \( a_7=897 \) mod256:
256*3=768, 897-768=129, so 897≡129 mod256.

We need to solve 23k ≡1 mod256, starting from k=39 (since \( a_6=897=23*39 \)).

But 23*39=897≡129 mod256. So, we need to find the next multiple of23 beyond 897 that is1 mod256.

Alternatively, solve 23k ≡1 mod256.

Again, using the inverse of23 mod256. Earlier, we saw that inverse mod64 is39, but let's compute the inverse mod256.

Using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm:

Find x such that23x ≡1 mod256.

256 = 11*23 +3 (because 23*11=253; 256-253=3)

23=7*3 +2

3=1*2 +1

2=2*1 +0

Backwards:

1=3 -1*2

But 2=23 -7*3, so

1=3 -1*(23 -7*3)=8*3 -1*23

But 3=256 -11*23, so

1=8*(256 -11*23) -1*23=8*256 -72*23 -1*23=8*256 -73*23

Therefore, -73*23 ≡1 mod256, so inverse is -73 mod256. Which is256-73=183.

Thus, inverse is183. Therefore, \( a_8=23*183=4209 \).

Check if \( a_7=897 \) equals \( a_8=4209 \)? No, so \( a_8 \neq a_7 \).

Next, \( n=8 \rightarrow n=9 \):

Find \( a_9 \) as the least multiple of23 that is1 mod512.

Compute \( a_8=4209 \) mod512:

512*8=4096, 4209-4096=113, so 4209≡113 mod512.

We need to find the smallest multiple of23 greater than or equal to4209 that is1 mod512.

Alternatively, solve23k≡1 mod512. Using the inverse we found earlier, which is183 mod256. Let's compute the inverse mod512.

Wait, perhaps it's more efficient to note that since23*183≡1 mod256, we can lift this solution to mod512.

So, suppose x=183 +256*t is the inverse modulo512.

Then,23*(183 +256*t) ≡1 mod512.

Compute23*183: 23*180=4140, 23*3=69, so total 4140+69=4209.

4209 mod512: 512*8=4096, 4209-4096=113, so4209≡113 mod512.

So, 113 +23*256*t ≡1 mod512.

Calculate23*256=5888.

5888 mod512: 512*11=5632, 5888-5632=256, so5888≡256 mod512.

So, equation becomes:113 +256*t ≡1 mod512

Which simplifies to:

256*t ≡1 -113 mod512

256*t ≡-112 mod512

Simplify modulus: divide both sides by256:

t ≡ (-112)/256 mod2

But -112/256 = -7/16, which isn't an integer. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, 256*t ≡-112 mod512.

Divide both sides by gcd(256,512)=256:

t ≡ (-112)/256 mod (512/256)=2.

But -112/256 = -7/16, which is still fractional. Hmm, perhaps my approach is wrong.

Wait, another way: 256*t ≡ -112 mod512.

Multiply both sides by inverse of256 mod512. But since256 and512 share a factor of256, the inverse doesn't exist. Instead, the equation has solutions only if -112 is divisible bygcd(256,512)=256.

But -112 is not divisible by256, so no solution? That can't be right because23 and512 are coprime, so23 must have an inverse mod512.

Wait, perhaps my mistake was in computing23*256 mod512.

Wait, 23*256=5888. Now, 5888 divided by512: 512*11=5632, 5888-5632=256. So,23*256≡256 mod512.

So, going back:113 +256*t ≡1 mod512 =>256*t ≡ -112 mod512.

Let me rewrite this as256*t ≡300 mod512, since -112 +512=400, but wait, 512-112=400? Wait, no: -112 mod512 is512-112=400. So,256*t≡400 mod512.

Divide both sides by GCD(256,512)=256:

t ≡400/256 mod (512/256)=2

400/256=25/16≈1.5625. Hmm, fractional again. Wait, but t must be integer.

This suggests that perhaps my initial assumption is flawed. Maybe I should use another method.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express the inverse of23 mod512 as183 +256*t, and find t such that23*(183 +256*t)≡1 mod512.

Compute23*183=4209, as before, which is113 mod512.

So,23*(183 +256*t)=4209 +23*256*t≡113 +256*t mod512.

Set equal to1:113 +256*t ≡1 mod512 =>256*t ≡-112 mod512.

Again, same equation.

Perhaps instead of trying to solve for t, recognize that256 is half of512, so perhaps t needs to satisfy:

256*t ≡ -112 mod512 => Multiply both sides by1/256, but since256 and512 aren't coprime, that's not straightforward.

Alternatively, note that256*t ≡ -112 mod512 implies that t ≡ (-112)/256 mod2, since512/256=2.

But (-112)/256= -7/16, which is still not an integer, which suggests that perhaps my approach is incorrect.

Wait, maybe stepping back, perhaps I should use the fact that the inverse of23 mod512 can be obtained by lifting the inverse mod256. So, since23*183≡1 mod256, we can write23*(183 +256*k)≡1 +23*256*k mod512.

We need1 +23*256*k ≡1 mod512, so23*256*k ≡0 mod512.

Compute23*256=5888. 5888 mod512=5888 -11*512=5888 -5632=256. So,23*256≡256 mod512.

Thus,256*k ≡0 mod512 =>k≡0 mod2.

Therefore, k=2*m for some integer m.

Thus, the inverse is183 +256*2*m=183 +512*m.

Therefore, the inverse of23 mod512 is183 mod512.

Thus, \( a_9=23*183=4209 \).

But wait, earlier we had \( a_8=4209 \). So, \( a_9=4209 \), which is same as \( a_8 \). So, \( a_8 = a_9 \). So, that's another instance.

Wait, so \( n=8,9 \) give the same \( a_n \).

But wait, hold on: When we computed \( a_8=4209 \), which is1 mod512?

Wait, no, 4209 mod512: 512*8=4096, 4209-4096=113, so4209≡113 mod512. That contradicts the earlier statement.

Wait, no, if \( a_8=4209 \), which is supposed to be1 mod512, but 4209 mod512 is113≠1. So, that must mean that my computation was wrong.

Wait, no, perhaps I messed up in the process.

Wait, confusion arises between different steps.

Wait, \( a_8 \) is the least multiple of23 that is1 mod256. So, \( a_8=4209 \), which is1 mod256, as 4209 mod256:

256*16=4096, 4209-4096=113, so 4209≡113 mod256. Wait, that can't be right. If \( a_8 \) is supposed to be1 mod256, why is it113?

Wait, hold on. There seems to be confusion in notation.

Wait, no, in the step above, when we computed \( a_8 \), it was the first multiple of23 that is1 mod256. So, actually, we need to find the minimal k such that23k ≡1 mod256. Once found, \( a_8=23k \). That k was found to be183, so \( a_8=23*183=4209 \). But 4209 mod256 is113, which is not1. Wait, that can't be.

Wait, this is a contradiction. If \( a_8 \) is constructed as the inverse of23 mod256, then \( a_8=23*183=4209 \), but4209 mod256 should be1, right?

Wait, 256*16=4096, 4209-4096=113, so 4209≡113 mod256. Wait, so that suggests that 23*183≡113 mod256, which conflicts with the idea that 23*183≡1 mod256.

Hmm, clearly, I must have messed up somewhere.

Wait, originally, we thought that the inverse of23 mod256 is183, but when multiplying23*183, we get4209, which is113 mod256. So, that must be wrong.

Wait, wait, no. Let's recalculate23*183.

23*180=4140

23*3=69

Total:4140+69=4209.

4209 divided by256:

256*16=4096

4209-4096=113

Thus,4209≡113 mod256.

So, indeed,23*183≡113 mod256≠1.

Wait, so my mistake was in thinking that183 is the inverse of23 mod256, but in reality, it's not.

Wait, let's redo the calculation.

Earlier, when computing the inverse mod256, I did:

256 =11*23 +3

23=7*3 +2

3=1*2 +1

2=2*1 +0

Then back substitution:

1=3 -1*2

But 2=23 -7*3, so

1=3 -1*(23 -7*3)=8*3 -1*23

But 3=256 -11*23, so

1=8*(256 -11*23) -1*23=8*256 -88*23 -1*23=8*256 -89*23

Therefore, -89*23 ≡1 mod256, so the inverse is -89 mod256, which is256-89=167.

Thus, the inverse is167, not183.

Therefore, correct inverse is167, so \( a_8=23*167=3841 \).

Now, check3841 mod256:

256*15=3840, so3841≡1 mod256. Correct.

So, \( a_8=3841 \).

Now, proceed to \( n=9 \):

We need \( a_9 \) as the least multiple of23 that is1 mod512.

Compute \( a_8=3841 \) mod512:

512*7=3584, 3841-3584=257, so3841≡257 mod512.

We need23k≡1 mod512. Starting fromk=167 (since \( a_8=23*167=3841 \)), compute23*167=3841≡257 mod512.

Need to find the next multiple:23*(167 + t)≡1 mod512.

So,23*167 +23*t ≡1 mod512.

But23*167≡257 mod512, so257 +23*t ≡1 mod512.

Thus,23*t ≡1 -257 mod512=>23*t ≡-256 mod512=>23*t≡256 mod512.

So, equation:23*t ≡256 mod512.

Again, to solve for t, we can use the inverse of23 mod512.

Earlier, we saw that the inverse of23 mod256 is167, but what about mod512?

Assume the inverse is167 +256*s. Let's find s such that23*(167 +256*s)≡1 mod512.

Compute23*167=3841≡257 mod512.

23*256*s=5888*s≡256*s mod512.

So, overall:257 +256*s ≡1 mod512.

Thus,256*s ≡1 -257 mod512=>256*s≡-256 mod512=>256*s≡256 mod512.

Divide both sides by256: s≡1 mod2.

Thus, s=1 +2*m for integer m.

Therefore, the inverse is167 +256*1=423 mod512.

Thus, inverse of23 mod512 is423.

Therefore, \( a_9=23*423=9729 \).

Check if \( a_8=3841 \) equals \( a_9=9729 \)? No, so \( a_9 \neq a_8 \).

Proceed to \( n=10 \):

Find \( a_{10} \) as the least multiple of23 that is1 mod1024.

Compute \( a_9=9729 \) mod1024:

1024*9=9216, 9729-9216=513, so9729≡513 mod1024.

We need23k≡1 mod1024. Start fromk=423 (since \( a_9=23*423=9729 \)).

Compute23*423=9729≡513 mod1024.

We need to find t such that23*(423 + t)≡1 mod1024.

Thus,23*423 +23*t≡1 mod1024.

But23*423≡513 mod1024, so513 +23*t≡1 mod1024.

Thus,23*t≡1 -513 mod1024=>23*t≡-512 mod1024=>23*t≡512 mod1024.

So, equation:23*t≡512 mod1024.

Again, use the inverse of23 mod1024. Previously, we found the inverse mod512 is423. Let's find the inverse mod1024.

Expressed as423 +512*s. Let's find s such that23*(423 +512*s)≡1 mod1024.

Compute23*423=9729≡513 mod1024.

23*512*s=11648*s≡(11648 mod1024)*s. Compute11648 /1024:1024*11=11264, 11648-11264=384. So,23*512*s≡384*s mod1024.

So, overall equation:513 +384*s ≡1 mod1024.

Thus,384*s ≡1 -513 mod1024=>384*s≡-512 mod1024=>384*s≡512 mod1024.

Divide both sides byGCD(384,1024)=128:

384/128=3, 512/128=4.

Thus, equation becomes:3*s≡4 mod(1024/128)=8.

So,3*s≡4 mod8.

Multiplicative inverse of3 mod8 is3, since3*3=9≡1 mod8.

Thus, multiply both sides by3: s≡4*3=12≡4 mod8.

So, s=4 +8*m.

Thus, the inverse is423 +512*4=423 +2048=2471 mod1024.

Compute2471 mod1024:1024*2=2048,2471-2048=423. So,2471≡423 mod1024. Wait, that can't be, because423 was the inverse mod512. Hmm, maybe something's wrong.

Wait, no, because when lifting from mod512 to1024, the inverse is423 +512*s, and we found s=4, so the inverse is423 +512*4=423 +2048=2471, which is larger than1024, so mod1024, it's2471-2*1024=2471-2048=423. So, same as before. That suggests that the inverse cycles, which isn't possible. Perhaps my approach is wrong.

Wait, another way: If23*x ≡1 mod1024, and x≡423 mod512, then x=423 +512*t. Plug into equation:

23*(423 +512*t)=23*423 +23*512*t≡1 + (23*512*t) mod1024.

Compute23*512=11648≡384 mod1024 (as before). So,

1 +384*t ≡1 mod1024.

Thus,384*t≡0 mod1024.

So,384*t≡0 mod1024.

Divide both sides by128: 3*t≡0 mod8.

Thus,3*t≡0 mod8.

Solutions: t≡0 mod(8/GCD(3,8))=8/1=8.

Therefore, t=8*m.

Thus, x=423 +512*8*m=423 +4096*m.

The smallest positive x is423, but since we're working mod1024, x=423 is the inverse? But 23*423=9729≡513 mod1024≠1. So, that can't be.

Wait, seems like I've hit a loop here. Maybe there's another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps instead of trying to compute \( a_n \) step-by-step, I can consider the binary expansion of23^{-1} mod2^n.

Wait, but maybe stepping back, let's look at the results we have so far:

n | a_n
---|---
1 |23
2 |69
3 |345
4 |897
5 |161
6 |897
7 |897
8 |3841
9 |9729
10| ?

Looking at this table, instances where \( a_n = a_{n+1} \) occur at n=5,7.

Is there a pattern every two steps? After n=5, we have a jump, then at n=7, another jump.

Wait, from n=1 to2, a_n changes.

From2 to3, changes.

From3 to4, changes.

From4 to5, changes.

At5, it drops back to161.

From5 to6, same value.

From6 to7, same.

From7 to8, jumps to3841.

From8 to9, jumps to9729.

From9 to10, presumably continues to jump.

Wait, but perhaps every odd n after a certain point, a_n stabilizes?

Wait, n=5,7,9,... seem to be points where a_n stabilizes, meaning that \( a_n = a_{n+1} \).

But let's check n=10:

Find \( a_{10} \) as the least multiple of23 that is1 mod2048.

Compute \( a_9=9729 \) mod2048:

2048*4=8192, 9729-8192=1537, so9729≡1537 mod2048.

We need23k≡1 mod2048. Start fromk=423 (since \( a_9=23*423=9729 \)).

Compute23*423=9729≡1537 mod2048.

Find t such that23*(423 +t)≡1 mod2048.

Thus,23*423 +23*t≡1 mod2048.

But23*423≡1537 mod2048, so1537 +23*t≡1 mod2048.

Thus,23*t≡1 -1537 mod2048=>23*t≡-1536 mod2048=>23*t≡512 mod2048.

Equation:23*t≡512 mod2048.

Again, use the inverse of23 mod2048. From prior steps, inverse mod512 is423, mod1024 is... hmm, confusion.

Alternatively, since23*t≡512 mod2048, notice that23 and2048 are coprime, so t exists.

We can write t= (512 * inv23) mod2048, where inv23 is inverse of23 mod2048.

But calculating inv23 mod2048 is tedious manually.

Alternatively, note that23*inv23≡1 mod2048.

But maybe note that23*89=2047≡-1 mod2048.

Indeed,23*89=2047, which is-1 mod2048. Therefore,23*(-89)≡1 mod2048.

Thus, inv23≡-89 mod2048≡2048-89=1959.

Thus, inverse is1959.

Therefore, t≡512*1959 mod2048.

Compute512*1959 mod2048.

Note that512*1959=512*(2048 - 89)=512*2048 -512*89.

512*2048 is a multiple of2048, so≡0 mod2048.

Thus,512*1959≡-512*89 mod2048.

Compute512*89: 512*90=46080, minus512=46080-512=45568.

45568 mod2048: 2048*22=45056, 45568-45056=512.

Thus,512*89≡512 mod2048.

Thus,512*1959≡-512 mod2048≡1536 mod2048.

Therefore, t≡1536 mod2048.

Thus, t=1536.

Therefore, the solution isk=423 +1536=1959.

Thus, \( a_{10}=23*1959=45057 \).

Check45057 mod2048:

2048*22=45056, so45057≡1 mod2048. Correct.

So, \( a_{10}=45057 \).

Compare with \( a_9=9729 \):45057≠9729, so \( a_9≠a_{10} \).

Wait, so now, we have instances where \( a_n = a_{n+1} \) at n=5,7, but n=9 didn't satisfy it. So, not every odd n beyond a certain point works.

Wait, let's list the a_ns and see where \( a_n = a_{n+1} \):

n | a_n | a_n == a_{n+1}
---|-----|-----
1 |23 | ?
2 |69 | ?
3 |345 | ?
4 |897 | ?
5 |161 |161 (from a_5 to a_6)
6 |897 |897 (from a_6 to a_7)
7 |897 |897 (from a_7 to a_8)
8 |3841 |?
9 |9729 |?
10|45057 |?

So, from n=5 to6, a_n increased, but a_5=161 and a_6=897, so not equal.

From n=6 to7: a_n stays at897.

From7 to8: a_n jumps to3841.

From8 to9: a_n jumps to9729.

From9 to10:a_n jumps to45057.

Wait, so actually, the only cases where \( a_n = a_{n+1} \) were at n=5 and n=7.

Wait, n=5: a_5=161, a_6=897. Not equal.

Wait, I must have miscounted earlier. Looking back, at n=5, a_5=161, a_6=897, which are different. At n=6, a_6=897, a_7=897, same. So, that's one instance.

Similarly, at n=7, a_7=897, a_8=3841, different. So, only one instance at n=6.

Wait, no, actually, wait. When n=5, a_5=161, a_6=897. Different. When n=6, a_6=897, a_7=897. Same. So, that's one instance.

When n=7, a_7=897, a_8=3841. Different.

n=8: a_8=3841, a_9=9729. Different.

n=9: a_9=9729, a_{10}=45057. Different.

So, only one instance where \( a_n = a_{n+1} \), which was at n=6.

But earlier, when I thought n=5 and7, but actually, n=5: a5=161, a6=897; n=6: a6=897, a7=897.

So, only one instance at n=6.

But wait, in our previous calculations, we saw that n=5,7 had \( a_n = a_{n+1} \), but actually, upon closer inspection, they weren't. So, perhaps only n=6 is such that \( a_n = a_{n+1} \).

But wait, let's test n=12.

Wait, maybe we need to compute further to see if more instances appear.

But this is getting time-consuming, and considering the problem asks up to n=1000, it's impractical to compute term by term.

Perhaps, instead, we can figure out a general rule or periodicity.

Wait, so in the examples above, whenever n is even, sometimes a_n stabilizes, sometimes not.

Looking back:

From n=1 to2: changed.

n=2 to3: changed.

n=3 to4: changed.

n=4 to5: changed.

n=5 to6: changed.

n=6 to7: stayed.

n=7 to8: changed.

n=8 to9: changed.

n=9 to10: changed.

So, only at n=6, it stayed.

So, maybe the stabilization occurs when n is congruent to1 mod something.

Wait, n=6: which is1 more than5, which was a drop.

Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, think about the multiplicative order.

Since23 is congruent to7 mod8, its multiplicative order modulo2^n.

In general, the multiplicative order of7 modulo2^n can be determined.

Wait, 7 mod8 is7, which has order2 mod8, since7^2=49≡1 mod8.

Mod16:7^2=49≡1 mod16? 49-16*3=1, so yes, 7^2≡1 mod16. So, order2.

Wait, actually, no: 7^2=49≡1 mod16, so order2.

Similarly, mod32:7^2=49≡17 mod32, 7^4≡17^2=289≡1 mod32, so order4.

Mod64:7^4≡1 mod64, so order4.

Wait, generally, for n≥3, the multiplicative order of7 modulo2^n is2^{n-2}.

Wait, is that correct?

Wait, 7 is a primitive root modulo2^n?

No, actually, 7 mod8 has order2, mod16 has order2, mod32 has order4, mod64 has order4, etc.

Wait, more precisely, the multiplicative order doubles every two exponents beyond a certain point.

Wait, perhaps the order of7 modulo2^n is2^{n-2} for n≥3.

But in any case, the order affects the period of the inverse.

But perhaps this is too abstract.

Alternatively, notice that for even n, the exponent lifting can result in the inverse being lifted without changing the lower bits, leading to stabilization.

Wait, from n=6 to7, a_n stayed same. Similarly, perhaps from n=even to n+1=odd, sometimes a_n remains same.

But in our case, at n=6, a_6=897, a_7=897. Then at n=7, a_7=897, a_8=3841, different.

Wait, so perhaps for even n, sometimes a_n stays same when lifting to n+1.

Wait, maybe when n is even and the inverse stabilizes upon lifting.

Wait, in our case, n=6 is even, and a_6=897, which is also1 mod128.

Because 897 mod128: 128*7=896, so897≡1 mod128.

Similarly, a_7=897, which is1 mod256.

Wait, 897 mod256:256*3=768, 897-768=129, so897≡129 mod256.

Wait, but earlier, a_7=897≡129 mod256.

Wait, maybe I got confused earlier. Let's recompute a_7.

Wait, a_6=897, which is1 mod128, as897-7*128=897-896=1.

So, a_6=897≡1 mod128.

Then, when lifting to mod256, we need a_7≡1 mod256.

But 897 mod256 is129, so to lift to1 mod256, we need to add256 -128=128? Wait, no.

Wait, current residue is129 mod256. To make it1 mod256, we need to subtract128. So, a_7=897 -128=769? But 769 mod256:256*3=768, so769≡1 mod256. But wait, 769 is less than897, which was a_6.

Wait, but 769 is smaller than897, but it's a multiple of23?

Wait, 769 /23=33.434..., so no. So, 769 is not a multiple of23.

Wait, this suggests an inconsistency.

Wait, no, perhaps the lifting process doesn't necessarily decrease the value.

Wait, to compute a_7 as the least multiple of23 that is1 mod256, starting from a_6=897.

Compute897 mod256=129.

We need to find the smallest multiple of23 greater than or equal to897 that is1 mod256.

So, starting from897, check if897≡1 mod256:129≠1, so not.

Compute897 +k*23≡1 mod256.

So,897 +23*k ≡1 mod256.

897 mod256=129, so129 +23*k≡1 mod256.

Thus,23*k≡1 -129=-128≡128 mod256.

So,23*k≡128 mod256.

Find k:23*k≡128 mod256.

23 and256 are coprime, so inverse exists.

Find inv23 mod256. Earlier, we found inverse of23 mod256 is167, as23*167=3841≡1 mod256.

So, k≡128*167 mod256.

Compute128*167:

128*160=20480

128*7=896

Total=20480+896=21376

21376 mod256:256*83=213, 21376 -256*83=21376 -21248=128

So,k≡128 mod256.

Thus, k=128 +256*m.

Thus, the next multiple is897 +23*128=897 +2944=3841.

Which is a_7=3841.

Which is consistent with our prior calculation.

Thus, a_7=3841, which is larger than a_6=897.

Wait, so even though a_6=897≡1 mod128, when lifting to256, we needed to increase k by128 to reach3841, making a_7=3841> a_6=897.

So, hence, a_6≠a_7.

Wait, but earlier, when I thought n=6 gave a_6=897 and a_7=897, that was incorrect.

Wait, let's recap:

Computed a_1=23, a_2=69, a_3=345, a_4=897, a_5=161, a_6=897, a_7=3841, a_8=3841? Wait, no.

Wait, confusion arose because when I computed a_7, I thought it was897, but actually, it's3841.

Wait, let's fix the table:

n | a_n
---|---
1 |23
2 |69
3 |345
4 |897
5 |161
6 |897
7 |3841
8 |?
9 |?

Wait, so from n=5 to6: a5=161, a6=897, different.

From n=6 to7: a6=897, a7=3841, different.

From n=7 to8: a7=3841, a8=?, let's compute a8.

Compute a7=3841. Need a8 as least multiple of23≡1 mod512.

3841 mod512:512*7=3584, 3841-3584=257, so3841≡257 mod512.

So, need23*k≡1 mod512, starting fromk=3841/23=167.

Compute23*167=3841≡257 mod512.

Need23*k≡1 mod512. So,23*k≡1 -257 mod512=>23*k≡-256 mod512=>23*k≡256 mod512.

Find k:23*k≡256 mod512.

Inverse of23 mod512 is423, as found earlier.

Thus, k≡256*423 mod512.

256*423=256*(400 +23)=256*400 +256*23=102400 +5888=108,288.

108,288 mod512:512*211=108, 512*200=102,400, 512*11=5,632; total102,400 +5,632=108,032. So,108,288 -108,032=256.

Thus, k≡256 mod512.

Thus, k=256 +512*m.

Thus, a8=23*(167 +256)=23*423=9729.

So, a8=9729.

Thus, a7=3841, a8=9729, different.

Continuing:

a8=9729. Need a9 as least multiple of23≡1 mod1024.

Compute9729 mod1024:1024*9=9216, 9729-9216=513, so9729≡513 mod1024.

Need23*k≡1 mod1024.

Start fromk=9729/23=423.

23*423=9729≡513 mod1024.

Need23*k≡1 mod1024. So,23*k≡1 -513 mod1024=>23*k≡-512 mod1024=>23*k≡512 mod1024.

Find k:23*k≡512 mod1024.

Inverse of23 mod1024 is1959, as found earlier.

Thus, k≡512*1959 mod1024.

Compute512*1959 mod1024.

512*1959=512*(2048 -89)=512*2048 -512*89.

512*2048 is multiple of1024, so≡0 mod1024.

512*89=45,568. 45,568 /1024=44.53125, so45,568=44*1024 + 512. Thus,45,568≡512 mod1024.

Thus,512*1959≡ -512 mod1024≡512 mod1024.

Therefore, k≡512 mod1024.

Thus, k=423 +512*m.

Thus, a9=23*(423 +512)=23*935=21505.

Check21505 mod1024:

1024*21=21,504, so21505-21,504=1, thus21505≡1 mod1024. Correct.

So, a9=21505.

Compare with a8=9729:21505≠9729, so \( a_8 \neq a_9 \).

Moving on:

Compute a10 as the least multiple of23≡1 mod2048.

a9=21505. Compute21505 mod2048:

2048*10=20,480, 21505-20,480=1,025, which is over2048. 2048*10=20,480, 21505-20,480=1,025.

Wait, 2048*5=10,240, 21505-10,240=11,265.

Wait, maybe compute differently:21505 /2048≈10.5, so2048*10=20,480, 21505-20,480=1,025.

1,025 mod2048=1,025.

Thus,21505≡1,025 mod2048.

Need23*k≡1 mod2048. Start fromk=21505/23=935.

23*935=21505≡1,025 mod2048.

Need23*k≡1 mod2048. So,23*k≡1 -1,025 mod2048=>23*k≡-1,024 mod2048=>23*k≡1,024 mod2048.

Find k:23*k≡1,024 mod2048.

Inverse of23 mod2048 is1959, as found earlier.

Thus, k≡1,024*1959 mod2048.

Compute1,024*1959 mod2048:

Note that1,024*1959=1,024*(2048 -89)=1,024*2048 -1,024*89.

1,024*2048 is multiple of2048, so≡0 mod2048.

1,024*89=91, 136. 91,136 /2048=44.58203125. So,91,136=44*2048 + 1,024. Thus,91,136≡1,024 mod2048.

Thus,1,024*1959≡ -1,024 mod2048≡1,024 mod2048.

Thus, k≡1,024 mod2048.

Thus, k=935 +1,024*m.

Thus, a10=23*(935 +1,024)=23*1,959=45,057.

Check45,057 mod2048:

2048*22=45,056, so45,057≡1 mod2048. Correct.

Thus, a10=45,057.

Compare with a9=21,505:45,057≠21,505, so \( a_9 \neq a_{10} \).

Hmm, so up to n=10, only n=6 had \( a_6 = a_7 \). Wait, no, in our corrected table:

n | a_n
---|---
1 |23
2 |69
3 |345
4 |897
5 |161
6 |897
7 |3841
8 |9729
9 |21505
10|45057

So, from n=6 to7:897→3841, different.

Wait, actually, when n=6, a6=897, which is same as a5=161? No, 897≠161.

Wait, perhaps my initial assumption was wrong.

Wait, n=5: a5=161.

n=6: a6=897.

n=7: a7=3841.

n=8: a8=9729.

n=9: a9=21505.

n=10:a10=45057.

So, none of these except possibly n=6 compared to n=5, but they differ.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in my prior reasoning.

If \( a_n = a_{n+1} \) iff \( a_n \equiv a_{n+1} \mod2^{n+1} \), which is equivalent to \( a_n \equiv a_{n+1} \mod2^{n+1} \).

But \( a_{n+1} \) is the least multiple of23 congruent to1 mod2^{n+1}, while \( a_n \) is the least multiple congruent to1 mod2^n.

Thus, \( a_{n+1} \) must be congruent to \( a_n \) mod2^n, but may differ mod2^{n+1}.

Therefore, \( a_{n+1} \) is congruent to \( a_n \) mod2^n, but differs in the next bit.

Therefore, unless \( a_n \) was already congruent to1 mod2^{n+1}, \( a_{n+1} \) would have to differ from \( a_n \) in the higher bit.

But \( a_n \) is the least multiple of23 congruent to1 mod2^n, but it might not be1 mod2^{n+1}.

Therefore, \( a_n \) is equal to \( a_{n+1} \) only if \( a_n \) was already1 mod2^{n+1}.

That is, \( a_n \) must satisfy \( a_n ≡1 \mod2^{n+1} \).

So, \( a_n \) is the least multiple of23≡1 mod2^n, but if it's also≡1 mod2^{n+1}, then \( a_n \) would be the same as \( a_{n+1} \).

Otherwise, \( a_{n+1} \) would be a different multiple.

Thus, the condition \( a_n = a_{n+1} \) is equivalent to \( a_n ≡1 \mod2^{n+1} \).

Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the number of positive integers \( n \leq1000 \) such that \( a_n ≡1 \mod2^{n+1} \).

Thus, \( a_n \) must be≡1 mod2^{n+1}. So, the question is, for how many n ≤1000, \( a_n \) is≡1 mod2^{n+1}.

So, how do we determine when \( a_n ≡1 \mod2^{n+1} \).

Given that \( a_n \) is the least multiple of23≡1 mod2^n.

Thus, \( a_n =23k_n \), where \( k_n \) is minimal such that23k_n ≡1 mod2^n.

Therefore, \( a_n ≡1 \mod2^n \), but we require \( a_n ≡1 \mod2^{n+1} \).

So, when does23k_n ≡1 mod2^{n+1}?

Which is,23k_n ≡1 mod2^{n+1}.

Given that23k_n ≡1 mod2^n, and we want it to hold mod2^{n+1}.

Thus,23k_n =1 + m*2^n.

To have23k_n ≡1 mod2^{n+1}, we need23k_n ≡1 mod2^{n+1}, which is equivalent to requiring that m*2^n ≡0 mod2^{n+1}, which implies that m must be even.

Therefore, m must be even, so that23k_n =1 +2^{n}*m, with m even.

Thus,23k_n ≡1 mod2^{n+1} holds if and only if m is even.

Therefore, we have that \( a_n ≡1 mod2^{n+1} \) if and only if the coefficient m in23k_n =1 +m*2^n is even.

So, the question reduces to determining for how many n≤1000, the solution k_n to23k_n ≡1 mod2^n has the property that the lift from mod2^n to mod2^{n+1} requires m to be even.

Alternatively, the multiplicative inverse of23 mod2^n must be liftable to mod2^{n+1} with m even.

But perhaps another angle: when lifting from n to n+1, the solution k_n can be extended to k_{n+1} =k_n +t*2^n, such that23*(k_n +t*2^n)≡1 mod2^{n+1}.

As per Hensel's lemma, if f(k)=23k -1, then f'(k)=23, which is odd, so Hensel's lemma applies uniquely.

Thus, there's a unique lift from k_n to k_{n+1}.

Therefore, the solution k_{n+1}=k_n +t*2^n, with t= floor((1 -23k_n)/(-2^{n})).

But regardless, the question is whether the lift causes m to be even.

Alternatively, since we have that23k_n ≡1 +m*2^n mod2^{n+1}, for m=0 or1.

Wait, no, m can be any integer, but modulo2.

Wait, more accurately, when lifting from mod2^n to mod2^{n+1}, the solution k_n can be extended uniquely tok_{n+1}=k_n +c*2^n, c∈{0,1}.

Thus, the new solution is k_{n+1}=k_n +c*2^n.

Then,23k_{n+1}=23k_n +23*c*2^n≡1 +23*c*2^n mod2^{n+1}.

We need23k_{n+1}≡1 mod2^{n+1}, so:

1 +23*c*2^n ≡1 mod2^{n+1}.

Thus,23*c*2^n ≡0 mod2^{n+1}.

Which simplifies to23*c≡0 mod2.

But23 is odd, so23*c≡c mod2≡0.

Thus, c must be0 mod2, i.e., c=0.

Therefore, the lift must take c=0 to maintain23k_{n+1}≡1 mod2^{n+1}.

But wait, that contradicts with our previous thought.

Wait, let's clarify:

We have23k_n ≡1 +m*2^n mod2^{n+1}.

We need23k_{n+1}=23(k_n +c*2^n)=23k_n +23c*2^n≡1 +m*2^n +23c*2^n mod2^{n+1}.

We want this ≡1 mod2^{n+1}, so:

1 + (m +23c)*2^n ≡1 mod2^{n+1}.

Thus, (m +23c)*2^n ≡0 mod2^{n+1}.

Divide both sides by2^n:

m +23c≡0 mod2.

Since23 is odd,23c≡c mod2.

Thus, m +c ≡0 mod2.

Therefore, c≡-m mod2.

So, c is determined by m.

But m is defined such that23k_n ≡1 +m*2^n mod2^{n+1}, so m is the coefficient when expressing23k_n -1 as m*2^n.

Thus, m is either0 or1 mod2.

Wait, no, actually m can be any integer, but in mod2.

Wait, perhaps m is the carryover when moving from mod2^n to mod2^{n+1}.

Wait, I think the key is that for23k_n ≡1 mod2^{n+1}, the coefficient m must be even, i.e., m≡0 mod2.

Thus, m is even.

But m is the coefficient when23k_n =1 +m*2^n.

Therefore, m=(23k_n -1)/2^n.

Thus, m must be even, i.e., (23k_n -1)/2^n is even.

Thus,23k_n -1≡0 mod2^{n+1}.

Which is exactly the condition that a_n ≡1 mod2^{n+1}.

Therefore, the condition that \( a_n = a_{n+1} \) is equivalent to \( a_n ≡1 mod2^{n+1} \), which is equivalent tom being even.

Thus, to count the number of n≤1000 such that m is even, i.e., (23k_n -1)/2^n is even.

Alternatively, this can be phrased as the valuation v2(23k_n -1) ≥n+1.

Which is, the exponent of2 dividing23k_n -1 is at leastn+1.

So, the multiplicative inverse of23 mod2^n has a lift to mod2^{n+1} with23k_n -1 divisible by2^{n+1}.

So, when does this happen?

Well, in the theory of 2-adic numbers, the inverse of23 modulo2^n can be lifted uniquely to higher powers, but the divisibility by2^{n+1} depends on the derivative.

But perhaps it's more straightforward to model the behavior of the sequence.

From our computations:

n | a_n | a_n mod2^{n+1}
---|----|----
1 |23 |23 mod4=23-20=3≠1
2 |69 |69 mod8=5≠1
3 |345 |345 mod16=5≠1
4 |897 |897 mod32=17≠1
5 |161 |161 mod64=33≠1
6 |897 |897 mod128=1≠1
7 |3841 |3841 mod256=1≠1
8 |9729 |9729 mod512=513≠1
9 |21505 |21505 mod1024=1≠1
10|45057 |45057 mod2048=1≠1

Wait, so for n=6, a6=897, which is1 mod128 (2^7). So, a6≡1 mod2^{7}.

Similarly, for n=7, a7=3841≡1 mod256 (2^8). So, a7≡1 mod2^{8}.

Wait, but for n=6, a6=897≡1 mod128=2^7, which is exactlyn+1=7.

Similarly, for n=7, a7=3841≡1 mod256=2^8, which is n+1=8.

Wait, so is this a general trend?

That is, for n≥6, \( a_n ≡1 mod2^{n+1} \), hence \( a_n = a_{n+1} \).

But wait, from our previous calculations:

n=6: a6=897≡1 mod128=2^7.

n=7: a7=3841≡1 mod256=2^8.

n=8: a8=9729≡1 mod512=2^9? Wait, 9729 mod512=9729-512*18=9729-9216=513≡1 mod512? Wait, 513≡1 mod512?

Wait, 513=512 +1, so yes,513≡1 mod512.

Wait, so a8=9729≡1 mod512=2^9.

Similarly, n=8: a8≡1 mod512=2^9.

Similarly, n=9: a9=21505 mod1024=21505-1024*21=21505-21504=1 mod1024=2^{10}.

Similarly, n=10: a10=45057 mod2048=45057-2048*22=45057-45056=1 mod2048=2^{11}.

So, in general, for n≥6, \( a_n ≡1 mod2^{n+1} \). Therefore, \( a_n = a_{n+1} \) for all n≥6.

But wait, let's verify n=6:

a6=897, a7=3841.

Compute3841 mod128=3841 -128*30=3841 -3840=1. So,3841≡1 mod128.

But a6=897 mod128=1. So, a6≡1 mod128, so when lifting to mod256, we can have a7=3841≡1 mod256.

Thus, a6≡1 mod128, a7≡1 mod256, which is stronger.

Similarly, a7≡1 mod256, so a8≡1 mod512.

And so on.

Therefore, once the inverse stabilizes at1 mod2^{n+1}, the subsequent terms continue to satisfy the condition.

Therefore, starting from n=6, each \( a_n ≡1 mod2^{n+1} \), hence \( a_n = a_{n+1} \) for n≥6.

Therefore, for all n≥6, \( a_n = a_{n+1} \).

Therefore, the number of positive integers n ≤1000 such that \( a_n = a_{n+1} \) is equal to the number of integers n≥6 and n≤1000.

Which is1000 -6 +1=995.

Wait, but let's confirm:

From n=6 to n=1000 inclusive, the number of terms is1000 -6 +1=995.

But wait, in our computations, n=6 gave a6=897, a7=3841, which are different, but both are≡1 mod higher powers.

However, according to the problem statement, \( a_n = a_{n+1} \) if and only if \( a_n ≡a_{n+1} \mod2^{n+1} \).

But in our case, for n≥6, \( a_n ≡1 mod2^{n+1} \), hence \( a_{n+1} ≡1 mod2^{n+2} \), which is automatically true because \( a_{n+1} \) is constructed to be≡1 mod2^{n+2}.

But wait, no, \( a_{n+1} \) is the least multiple of23≡1 mod2^{n+2}, but if \( a_n ≡1 mod2^{n+1} \), then \( a_{n+1} \) could potentially be equal to \( a_n \) only if \( a_n ≡1 mod2^{n+2} \).

Wait, no, actually, \( a_{n+1} \) is the least multiple of23≡1 mod2^{n+2}, so \( a_{n+1} \) is the smallest such number. If \( a_n ≡1 mod2^{n+1} \), but not necessarily mod2^{n+2}, then \( a_{n+1} \) might be larger.

Wait, but in our calculations, \( a_n ≡1 mod2^{n+1} \) for n≥6.

So, for example, a6=897≡1 mod128, which is2^7, but a7=3841≡1 mod256=2^8.

But a7≡1 mod256, which is higher than a6's mod128.

So, if a_n ≡1 mod2^{n+1}, then when constructing a_{n+1}, we have to solve23k≡1 mod2^{n+2}.

But since23k≡1 mod2^{n+1}, we can lift this solution to mod2^{n+2}.

By Hensel's lemma, because the derivative23 is odd, the solution can be uniquely lifted.

Therefore, if a_n≡1 mod2^{n+1}, then a_{n+1} is determined by lifting k_n to k_{n+1}=k_n +c*2^n, ensuring23k_{n+1}≡1 mod2^{n+2}.

But if a_n≡1 mod2^{n+1}, then when lifting, the coefficient c will satisfy c= (something). But crucially, whether a_{n+1}=a_n depends on whether the lift doesn't change the value.

But since23 is invertible mod2^{n+2}, the solution k_{n+1} is unique, and a_{n+1}=23k_{n+1}.

But since a_n=23k_n≡1 mod2^{n+1}, and a_{n+1}=23k_{n+1}≡1 mod2^{n+2}.

But a_{n+1}=23k_{n+1}=23(k_n +c*2^n)=23k_n +23c*2^n≡1 +23c*2^n mod2^{n+2}.

Therefore, to have a_{n+1}≡1 mod2^{n+2}, we need23c*2^n≡0 mod2^{n+2}, which implies23c≡0 mod4.

But23 is odd, so23c≡c mod4≡0.

Thus, c≡0 mod4.

Therefore, c must be0 mod4.

Thus, when lifting, c can be0,1,2,3 mod4, but to satisfy the condition, c must be0 mod4.

Thus, the lift requires c=4d, so c≡0 mod4.

Therefore, the solution for c is unique mod2^{n+1}.

Wait, perhaps this is getting too convoluted.

An alternative approach: since we've observed that for n≥6, each a_n≡1 mod2^{n+1}, hence \( a_n = a_{n+1} \) for n≥6.

Thus, for each n≥6, \( a_n = a_{n+1} \).

Therefore, the number of such n≤1000 is1000 -6 +1=995.

But in our earlier calculations, a6=897, a7=3841, which are different, but a6≡1 mod128, a7≡1 mod256, which is a stronger condition.

But according to the problem statement, \( a_n = a_{n+1} \) if and only if \( a_n ≡a_{n+1} \mod2^{n+1} \).

But in this case, a6≡1 mod128, so a6≡1 mod128, and a7≡1 mod256.

But a7≡1 mod256 implies a7≡1 mod128, so a7≡a6 mod128.

Thus, \( a6 ≡a7 mod128 \), so \( a6 = a7 \)?

But a6=897, a7=3841, which are different.

Wait, that seems contradictory.

Wait, no, a7 is the least multiple of23≡1 mod256, whereas a6 is the least multiple≡1 mod128.

So, a6=897, a7=3841.

But3841 mod128=1, and a6=897 mod128=1.

Therefore, a7≡1 mod128, same as a6.

But since a7 is≡1 mod256, which is a stronger condition, but in mod128, both are1.

Therefore, a7≡a6 mod128, hence a7≡a6 mod2^{6+1}=2^7.

Therefore, \( a6 =a7 \) if and only if a6≡a7 mod128, which they do.

But wait, in reality, a6=897, a7=3841.

Compute897 mod256:256*3=768,897-768=129.

So, a6=897≡129 mod256.

a7=3841 mod256:256*15=3840,3841-3840=1. Thus,a7≡1 mod256.

Therefore, a6≡129 mod256, a7≡1 mod256.

Therefore, a6≡a7 mod128 (since both≡1 mod128), but not mod256.

Thus, in this case, \( a6≡a7 mod128 \), but \( a6≢a7 mod256 \).

Therefore, in our problem statement, \( a_n =a_{n+1} \) iff \( a_n ≡a_{n+1} mod2^{n+1} \).

So, in this case, n=6: \( a6=897 \), \( a7=3841 \).

Check \( a6 ≡a7 mod128 \): Yes, both≡1 mod128.

But \( a6 ≡129 mod256 \), \( a7≡1 mod256 \). So, \( a6≡a7 mod128 \), but \( a6≢a7 mod256 \). Thus, \( a6 ≡a7 mod2^{6+1}=2^7 \) is false.

Wait, but according to Hensel's lemma, the solution can be lifted, but the actual values might not coincide until a higher power.

Wait, perhaps my initial conclusion was wrong.

Wait, actually, when you lift the inverse from mod2^n to mod2^{n+1}, the value can change.

But in our case, when lifting from n=6 to7, we have a6=897≡1 mod128, a7=3841≡1 mod256.

But since23k≡1 mod256 requires k= something different than the k for mod128.

Therefore, in reality, a7 is different from a6, but they are congruent mod128.

Thus, a6≡a7 mod128, but a6≢a7 mod256, so \( a6 ≡a7 mod2^{6+1} \) is false.

But according to our earlier logic, when \( a_n ≡1 mod2^{n+1} \), then \( a_{n+1}=a_n \). But in reality, it's the opposite: when \( a_n ≡1 mod2^{n+1} \), then \( a_{n+1}=a_n \).

Wait, no, in reality, for n≥6, a_n≡1 mod2^{n+1}, which would imply a_{n+1}=a_n.

But our calculations show that a6=897≡1 mod128=2^7, which would imply a7= a6.

But a7=3841≠897, yet3841≡1 mod256, which is a higher power.

Wait, so maybe the issue is that even though a6≡1 mod128, a7 is different but satisfies a stronger congruence.

So, perhaps the reasoning that once a_n≡1 mod2^{n+1}, then a_{n+1}=a_n is flawed.

Instead, the correct condition is that if a_n≡1 mod2^{n+1}, then a_{n+1}=a_n. Otherwise, a_{n+1}=something else.

But in our case, a6≡1 mod128=2^7, so according to the condition, a7 should be equal to a6. But a7=3841≠a6=897.

Therefore, perhaps my previous logic was incorrect.

Wait, let's think again.

The problem defines \( a_n \) as the least multiple of23 that is≡1 mod2^{n+1}.

Thus, \( a_n \) is the minimal x=23k≡1 mod2^{n+1}.

So, \( a_n \) is the minimal such x.

If for some n, \( a_n = a_{n+1} \), that would mean that the minimal x for n+1 is the same as for n, which can only happen if the minimal x for n+1 is also minimal for n.

Which would happen only if the minimal x for n+1 also satisfies x≡1 mod2^{n+1}, which is a stronger condition.

Wait, no, x must be≡1 mod2^{n+1}, which is a stronger condition than x≡1 mod2^n.

Therefore, if x is minimal for n+1, it must be≡1 mod2^{n+1}, which automatically makes it≡1 mod2^n.

Thus, if \( a_{n+1} \) is the minimal x≡1 mod2^{n+2}, then \( a_{n+1} \) is also≡1 mod2^{n+1}.

Thus, \( a_{n+1} \) is also a candidate for \( a_n \). But \( a_n \) is the minimal such x for n.

Therefore, \( a_{n+1} \) is either equal to \( a_n \) or larger.

But from our computations:

a1=23, a2=69. a2=69 is minimal for n=1, which is mod2^2=4.

a2=69≡1 mod4, but69≡1 mod4, so a2 is minimal for n=1.

Similarly, a3=345≡1 mod8, minimal for n=2.

a3=345≡5 mod8, so minimal for n=2 is345.

Similarly, a4=897≡1 mod16, minimal for n=3.

a4=897≡9 mod16.

Wait, no, a4=897≡1 mod16, yes.

Wait, 897 /16=56*16=896, so897≡1 mod16.

Yes, so a4=897 is minimal for n=3.

Similarly, a5=161≡1 mod32.

161 /32=5*32=160, so161≡1 mod32.

So, a5=161 is minimal for n=4.

a6=897≡1 mod64.

897 /64=14*64=896, so897≡1 mod64.

Thus, a6=897 is minimal for n=5.

Similarly, a7=3841≡1 mod128.

3841 /128=29*128=3712,3841-3712=129, so3841≡129 mod128≡1 mod128.

So, a7=3841 is minimal for n=6.

Wait, but minimal for n=6 is mod128.

But a7=3841 is≡1 mod128, but also≡1 mod256.

Wait, but the minimal for n=6 is mod128, so minimal x≡1 mod128 is897≡1 mod128.

But a7 is≡1 mod256, which is a stronger condition.

But since897≡1 mod128, but897≡129 mod256, which is not1.

Therefore, a7 is the minimal x≡1 mod256, which is different from a6.

Therefore, in reality, for n=6, a6=897≡1 mod128, but a7=3841≡1 mod256, so a6≠a7.

Thus, the condition \( a_n =a_{n+1} \) is never satisfied, except possibly when the minimal x for n+1 is same as minimal x for n.

But that only occurs if minimal x for n+1 is≡1 mod2^{n+2}, which is also≡1 mod2^{n+1}.

But the minimal x for n+1 is going to be different unless23≡1 mod2^{n+2}.

But23 is≡23 mod32, which isn't1.

Thus, maybe the only time when \( a_n =a_{n+1} \) is when the minimal x for n+1 is same as minimal x for n, which only occurs when the minimal x for n+1 also satisfies x≡1 mod2^{n+1}.

But since the minimal x for n+1 is≡1 mod2^{n+2}, which is a stronger condition, the minimal x for n+1 is a multiple of23≡1 mod2^{n+2}, which automatically satisfies x≡1 mod2^{n+1}.

Thus, the minimal x for n+1 is a multiple of the minimal x for n.

Therefore, if a_{n+1}=a_n, then a_n must be≡1 mod2^{n+2}.

But in our calculations, a6=897≡1 mod128=2^7, but not mod256=2^8.

Thus, a7=3841≡1 mod256, which is a different number.

Thus, the only time when a_{n}=a_{n+1} is when the minimal x for n+1 is also the minimal x for n.

But that only happens when23≡1 mod2^{n+2}.

But23≡23 mod32, which is not1.

Therefore, unless23≡1 mod2^{n+2}, which it never is, except trivially for n+2=1.

Thus, actually, maybe the only time when a_n=a_{n+1} is when n+2=1, i.e., n=-1, which is invalid.

Therefore, actually, \( a_n ≠a_{n+1} \) for all n≥1.

But this contradicts our earlier conclusion from lifting the inverse.

Wait, perhaps the key is that when the inverse of23 mod2^{n+1} is already≡1 mod2^{n+2}, then the minimal x for n+1 is the same as for n.

But in our case, for n=6, inverse is897≡1 mod128, but897≡129 mod256.

Thus, the minimal x for n=6 is897≡1 mod128.

The minimal x for n=7 is3841≡1 mod256.

But897 is not≡1 mod256, so a7 cannot be897.

Thus, the minimal x for n=7 is3841.

Therefore, a7≠a6.

Similarly, for n=7, the minimal x for n=8 is9729≡1 mod512, which is different from a7=3841.

Therefore, the conclusion is that \( a_n ≠a_{n+1} \) for all n≥1.

But that seems conflicting with the earlier thought that once the inverse stabilizes, a_n would remain.

But in reality, each a_{n+1} is built from the inverse lifting, which may require higher multiples, hence different numbers.

Therefore, in our calculations, all a_n for n=1 to10 are different.

Wait, but in our earlier calculations, a6=897, a7=3841, which are different, so a6≠a7.

Therefore, perhaps \( a_n ≠a_{n+1} \) for all n.

But then, why does the problem ask for the number of n≤1000 with \( a_n =a_{n+1} \)?

It must be that for certain n, a_n=a_{n+1}.

But according to our calculations, none.

But wait, let's check n=0.

Wait, n starts from1.

Wait, unless for some n, a_n≡1 mod2^{n+1}.

Meaning, a_n=1 mod2^{n+1}.

But a_n is≡1 mod2^{n+1}, which is a much stronger condition.

So, for n=1, a1=23≡23 mod4≡3 mod4≡-1 mod4.

Not1 mod4.

n=2: a2=69≡1 mod8, which is1 mod8.

Wait, 69 mod8=1.

So, a2=69≡1 mod8=2^3.

Therefore, for n=2, a2≡1 mod2^{3}=8.

Therefore, when n=2, \( a_n =a_{n+1} \)?

Check if a2=69, a3=345.

345 mod16=5, which is not1.

Therefore, a3≡5 mod16≠1, so a2≠a3.

Similarly, for n=3, a3=345≡1 mod16, but a4=897≡9 mod32≠1.

Thus, a3≠a4.

Wait, but a2=69≡1 mod8, but a3=345≡5 mod16≠1.

Thus, only for n=2, a_n≡1 mod2^{n+1}=mod8, but a_{n+1}=a3≡5 mod16≠1.

Similarly, for n=3, a3≡1 mod16, but a4=897≡9 mod32≠1.

So, in general, for n≥2, a_n≡1 mod2^{n+1} only when n=2, because a2=69≡1 mod8=2^3.

But a3=345≡5 mod16≠1.

So, only for n=2, a_n≡1 mod2^{n+1}.

Wait, but 2^{n+1}=2^{3}=8 for n=2.

Wait, so in general, for n≥2, a_n≡1 mod2^{n+1} is required for a_n=a_{n+1}.

But for n=2, a2=69≡1 mod8, but a3=345≡5 mod16≠1.

Thus, a2≠a3.

Similarly, for n=3, a3=345≡1 mod16, but a4=897≡9 mod32≠1.

Therefore, a3≠a4.

Only for n=2, a_n≡1 mod8, but a_{n+1}=a3≡5 mod16≠1.

Thus, in fact, there is no n for which a_n=a_{n+1}.

But that contradicts our earlier thought that for n≥6, a_n≡1 mod2^{n+1}.

But in reality, a6=897≡1 mod128=2^7, but a7=3841≡1 mod256=2^8.

But a7 is not≡1 mod128, because3841 mod128=1, but a7=3841≡1 mod256, which is a stronger condition.

Wait, no, 3841 mod128=1.

Wait, 256 is2^8, so3841 mod256=1.

But 3841 mod128=1 as well, since256 is a multiple of128.

Thus, a7=3841≡1 mod128 and≡1 mod256.

Thus, a7 is≡1 mod128, same as a6.

But a6=897≡1 mod128, a7=3841≡1 mod128.

But a6=897≡129 mod256, a7=3841≡1 mod256.

Thus, a6≡a7 mod128, but not mod256.

Therefore, \( a6 ≡a7 mod128 \), but \( a6≢a7 mod256 \).

Therefore, \( a6 =a7 \) is false.

Thus, the conclusion is that for all n, \( a_n ≠a_{n+1} \).

But the problem states "for how many positive integers n ≤1000 does a_n =a_{n+1} hold?"

If none, then the answer is0.

But that seems unlikely, as the problem wouldn't ask for0.

Wait, perhaps there's a misunderstanding.

Wait, the problem says "the least positive integer a such that a ≡1 mod2^{n+1} and a is a multiple of23".

So, a is the minimal multiple of23≡1 mod2^{n+1}.

Thus, for each n, a_n is the least multiple of23≡1 mod2^{n+1}.

Thus, if for some n, the minimal multiple of23 that is≡1 mod2^{n+1} is the same as the minimal multiple of23≡1 mod2^{n+2}, then a_{n}=a_{n+1}.

But when does this happen?

When the minimal multiple of23≡1 mod2^{n+1} is also≡1 mod2^{n+2}.

Which would require that the minimal solution k for23k≡1 mod2^{n+1} satisfies23k≡1 mod2^{n+2}.

But23k≡1 mod2^{n+2} is a stronger condition.

Therefore, unless the minimal k for mod2^{n+1} also solves mod2^{n+2}, which is possible only if23k≡1 mod2^{n+2}.

But23k≡1 mod2^{n+1} doesn't imply23k≡1 mod2^{n+2}.

Unless23k≡1 mod2^{n+1} is also1 mod2^{n+2}.

Which is only possible if23k≡1 mod2^{n+2}, which would mean that k≡(23^{-1} mod2^{n+2}).

But since23^{-1} mod2^{n+1} is unique, it's equal to23^{-1} mod2^{n+2} only if23^{-1} mod2^{n+1} is≡1 mod2^{n+1}.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that if23 is invertible mod2^{n+2}, and the inverse is the same as the inverse mod2^{n+1}, then the minimal solution would be the same.

But that's not necessarily true.

Alternatively, perhaps the solution is based on the fact that the inverse of23 mod2^{n+1} can be lifted uniquely mod2^{n+2}, so the minimal solution is unique.

But in our case, the minimal solution for n=1 is23, which is not≡1 mod4.

Wait, n=1: a1=23≡3 mod4.

n=2: a2=69≡1 mod8.

n=3: a3=345≡5 mod16.

n=4: a4=897≡9 mod32.

n=5: a5=161≡17 mod64.

n=6: a6=897≡1 mod128.

n=7: a7=3841≡1 mod256.

n=8: a8=9729≡1 mod512.

n=9: a9=21505≡1 mod1024.

n=10: a10=45057≡1 mod2048.

Each time, the minimal solution is doubling the previous multiple of23, adding something.

Wait, for n=2, a2=69=23*3.

For n=3, a3=345=23*15.

For n=4, a4=897=23*39.

For n=5, a5=161=23*7.

Wait, that's inconsistent.

Wait, 161=23*7.

But 7 is less than39.

Wait, perhaps the minimal multiple is not always the multiple beyond the previous.

Wait, seems inconsistent.

Alternatively, noticing that for n≥2, a_n = a_{n+1} only if the minimal solution for23≡1 mod2^{n+1} is also the minimal solution for23≡1 mod2^{n+2}.

But since23≡23 mod2^{n+2}, the minimal solution for23≡1 mod2^{n+2} is a multiple of23, which must also satisfy23k≡1 mod2^{n+1}.

But since2^{n+2} is a multiple of2^{n+1}, any solution mod2^{n+2} is also a solution mod2^{n+1}.

But the minimal solution for mod2^{n+2} is less than2^{n+2}, so if it's a multiple of23, it's at least23.

Thus, for the minimal solution for mod2^{n+2} to be the same as the minimal solution for mod2^{n+1}, it must be that the minimal solution for mod2^{n+1} is also a solution mod2^{n+2}.

Which would require that23k≡1 mod2^{n+1} implies23k≡1 mod2^{n+2}.

But23k≡1 mod2^{n+1} doesn't necessarily imply23k≡1 mod2^{n+2}.

Therefore, unless23k≡1 mod2^{n+2}, which is a stronger condition, a_{n}=a_{n+1} is not satisfied.

Therefore, perhaps the only time when a_n=a_{n+1} is when23k≡1 mod2^{n+1} automatically implies23k≡1 mod2^{n+2}, which is only possible if23k≡1 mod2^{n+2}.

But since23 is odd,23k≡1 mod2^{n+1} implies that23k=1 +m*2^{n+1}.

Then, to have23k≡1 mod2^{n+2}, we need1 +m*2^{n+1}≡1 mod2^{n+2}, which implies that m*2^{n+1}≡0 mod2^{n+2}, which implies that m must be even.

Thus, m=2t, so23k=1 +2t*2^{n+1}=1 +t*2^{n+2}.

Thus,23k≡1 mod2^{n+2}.

Therefore, if the minimal solution k for23k≡1 mod2^{n+1} is such that23k≡1 mod2^{n+2}, then a_{n}=a_{n+1}.

Otherwise, a_{n+1}=23*(k +c*2^{n+1})≡23k +23c*2^{n+1}≡1 +c*2^{n+2} mod2^{n+2}.

Thus, to have23k≡1 mod2^{n+2}, c must be chosen such that23c*2^{n+1}≡0 mod2^{n+2}, which requires c even.

But the minimal solution k is fixed.

Therefore, unless k is already such that23k≡1 mod2^{n+2}, which is equivalent to a_{n}=a_{n+1}, it won't hold.

Therefore, the condition a_n=a_{n+1} is equivalent to23k≡1 mod2^{n+2}, which is a stronger condition.

Thus, for each n, a_n=a_{n+1} iff23k≡1 mod2^{n+2}, where k is the minimal solution for23k≡1 mod2^{n+1}.

But this is equivalent to saying that the minimal solution for mod2^{n+1} is also a solution for mod2^{n+2}.

Which can only happen if23k≡1 mod2^{n+2}.

But23k≡1 mod2^{n+1} doesn't necessarily imply23k≡1 mod2^{n+2}.

Thus, for how many n≤1000 is23k≡1 mod2^{n+2} where k is the minimal solution for mod2^{n+1}.

Which is equivalent to the minimal solution for mod2^{n+1} also being the minimal solution for mod2^{n+2}.

But since23 is invertible mod2^{n+2}, the minimal solution is unique.

Therefore, unless the minimal solution for mod2^{n+1} is the same as mod2^{n+2}, which can only happen if the minimal solution for mod2^{n+1} is≡1 mod2^{n+2}.

Which is, in other words, when the inverse of23 mod2^{n+1} is≡1 mod2^{n+2}.

Which is only possible if the inverse of23 mod2^{n+1} is1 mod2^{n+2}.

But the inverse of23 mod2^{n+1} is the same as the inverse mod2^{n+2} if and only if23≡1 mod2^{n+1}.

Wait, that's a different direction.

Wait, 23≡23 mod2^{n+1}.

If23≡1 mod2^{n+1}, then23^{-1}≡1 mod2^{n+1}.

But23≡23 mod2^{n+1}.

So, unless23≡1 mod2^{n+1}, the inverse is not1.

Therefore, the only way for the inverse of23 mod2^{n+1} to be≡1 mod2^{n+2} is if23≡1 mod2^{n+1}.

But23≡23 mod2^{n+1}≠1 for n≥1, since23 is odd and23≠1 mod4.

Thus, for n=1,23≡3 mod4≠1.

n=2,23≡3 mod8≠1.

n=3,23≡7 mod16≠1.

n=4,23≡15 mod32≠1.

n=5,23≡17 mod64≠1.

n=6,23≡31 mod128≠1.

Etc.

Thus, for no n≥1,23≡1 mod2^{n+1}.

Therefore, the inverse of23 mod2^{n+1} is never1 mod2^{n+1}, so the minimal solution k for23k≡1 mod2^{n+1} is never1 mod2^{n+2}.

Therefore, the minimal solution k for mod2^{n+1} is not the same as for mod2^{n+2}, thus a_{n}=23k≠23k'=a_{n+1}.

Therefore, in conclusion, for no n≥1 does a_n=a_{n+1} hold.

Hence, the number of positive integers n≤1000 with a_n=a_{n+1} is0.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{0}
</think>

To solve the problem, we need to find the number of positive integers \( n \leq 1000 \) for which \( a_n = a_{n+1} \). Here, \( a_n \) is defined as the least positive integer multiple of 23 that is congruent to 1 modulo \( 2^{n+1} \).

1. **Understanding \( a_n \)**:
   - \( a_n \) is the smallest multiple of 23 that is congruent to 1 modulo \( 2^{n+1} \).
   - This means \( a_n \) satisfies \( a_n \equiv 1 \pmod{2^{n+1}} \) and \( a_n \) is a multiple of 23.

2. **Key Insight**:
   - For \( a_n = a_{n+1} \), the minimal solution \( a_n \) must also be a solution for the next modulus \( 2^{n+2} \).
   - This requires \( a_n \equiv 1 \pmod{2^{n+2}} \).

3. **Checking Conditions**:
   - We need to check if the minimal solution for \( a_n \) (which is \( 23k \equiv 1 \pmod{2^{n+1}} \)) also satisfies \( 23k \equiv 1 \pmod{2^{n+2}} \).
   - This involves checking if the inverse of 23 modulo \( 2^{n+1} \) is also the inverse modulo \( 2^{n+2} \).

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Through detailed calculations and analysis, it was found that for no \( n \geq 1 \) does the minimal solution \( a_n \) satisfy \( a_n \equiv 1 \pmod{2^{n+2}} \).
   - Therefore, there are no positive integers \( n \leq 1000 \) for which \( a_n = a_{n+1} \).

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{0}
