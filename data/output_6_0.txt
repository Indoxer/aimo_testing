Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \boxed{}. Provide only one \boxed{}.
 The problem: 
Let $x,$ $y,$ and $z$ be positive real numbers satisfying the system of equations:
\begin{align*} \sqrt{2x-xy} + \sqrt{2y-xy} &= 1 \\ \sqrt{2y-yz} + \sqrt{2z-yz} &= \sqrt2 \\ \sqrt{2z-zx} + \sqrt{2x-zx} &= \sqrt3. \end{align*} 
Then $\left[ (1-x)(1-y)(1-z) \right]^2$ can be written as $\frac{m}{n},$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n.$


Alright, so I have this problem with three variables x, y, z, all positive real numbers. They satisfy a system of three equations involving square roots. The goal is to find [(1 - x)(1 - y)(1 - z)] squared, express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, okay. Let me write down the equations again to get a clear view:

1. √(2x - xy) + √(2y - xy) = 1
2. √(2y - yz) + √(2z - yz) = √2
3. √(2z - zx) + √(2x - zx) = √3

So each equation has two square roots, each involving two variables multiplied together subtracted from twice another variable. Interesting structure.

I notice that each equation resembles something like √(A - AB) + √(B - AB) = something, but let's see.

Wait, maybe if I factor out the terms inside the square roots. Let's try that.

Looking at the first equation: √(2x - xy) + √(2y - xy) = 1

Factor out x from the first term and y from the second term:

√[x(2 - y)] + √[y(2 - x)] = 1

Similarly, for the second equation:

√[y(2 - z)] + √[z(2 - y)] = √2

And the third equation:

√[z(2 - x)] + √[x(2 - z)] = √3

Hmm, interesting. So each square root term is √[variable*(2 - other variable)]. 

This seems symmetric in some way. Maybe we can set variables such that u = 2 - x, v = 2 - y, w = 2 - z? Or perhaps not exactly, but maybe a substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps setting a = √[x(2 - y)], b = √[y(2 - x)], etc., but let's see.

Wait, let me think about what's inside the square roots. For example, in the first equation, x(2 - y) and y(2 - x). Let me denote them as follows:

Let’s define:

a = √[x(2 - y)]

b = √[y(2 - x)]

c = √[y(2 - z)]

d = √[z(2 - y)]

e = √[z(2 - x)]

f = √[x(2 - z)]

But then, looking back, the equations become:

1. a + b = 1

2. c + d = √2

3. e + f = √3

But also, note that:

From the definitions,

a² = x(2 - y)

b² = y(2 - x)

Similarly,

c² = y(2 - z)

d² = z(2 - y)

e² = z(2 - x)

f² = x(2 - z)

Hmm, perhaps we can find relations between these variables.

For instance, if I consider a² and b²:

a² = x(2 - y)

b² = y(2 - x)

If I add a² + b²:

a² + b² = x(2 - y) + y(2 - x) = 2x - xy + 2y - xy = 2x + 2y - 2xy = 2(x + y - xy)

Is there a way to relate this?

Similarly, from the definitions, perhaps multiplying a and b?

ab = √[x(2 - y) * y(2 - x)] = √[xy(2 - y)(2 - x)]

Not sure if that helps directly, but let me hold onto that thought.

Wait, maybe instead of dealing with a, b, etc., I should try to express x, y, z in terms of each other or find ratios or something.

Looking at the first equation: a + b = 1, and a² = x(2 - y), b² = y(2 - x). Maybe I can solve for x and y in terms of a and b.

Alternatively, since a + b = 1, perhaps express b = 1 - a, and substitute into b² expression.

Wait, let's try that.

From the first equation, b = 1 - a.

Thus, b² = (1 - a)^2 = 1 - 2a + a².

But b² is also equal to y(2 - x).

So, we have:

1 - 2a + a² = y(2 - x)

But a² = x(2 - y). Hmm.

So replacing a² with x(2 - y):

1 - 2a + x(2 - y) = y(2 - x)

Let me rearrange this:

1 - 2a + 2x - xy = 2y - xy

Wait, the -xy terms on both sides cancel out. So:

1 - 2a + 2x = 2y

So, 2x - 2y + 1 - 2a = 0

Divide both sides by 2:

x - y + (1 - 2a)/2 = 0

Hmm, not sure if that's helpful yet.

Alternatively, maybe express x in terms of y and a, or vice versa.

From a² = x(2 - y), so x = a² / (2 - y)

From above, we had 1 - 2a + a² = y(2 - x)

Substitute x = a² / (2 - y) into this equation:

1 - 2a + a² = y [2 - (a² / (2 - y))]

Simplify the right-hand side:

= y [ (2(2 - y) - a² ) / (2 - y) ]

= y [ (4 - 2y - a²) / (2 - y) ]

So now, left-hand side is 1 - 2a + a², which equals y times that fraction.

So:

1 - 2a + a² = [ y (4 - 2y - a²) ] / (2 - y )

Multiply both sides by (2 - y):

(1 - 2a + a²)(2 - y) = y (4 - 2y - a²)

Expand the left side:

(1)(2 - y) - 2a(2 - y) + a²(2 - y) = y(4 - 2y - a²)

Which is:

2 - y - 4a + 2ay + 2a² - a² y = 4y - 2y² - a² y

Bring all terms to the left side:

2 - y - 4a + 2ay + 2a² - a² y - 4y + 2y² + a² y = 0

Simplify term by term:

Constant term: 2

Linear terms: -y -4a -4y = (-5y -4a)

Cross terms: 2ay

Quadratic terms: 2a²

Cubic terms: (-a² y + a² y) = 0

Then +2y²

So overall:

2 - 5y - 4a + 2ay + 2a² + 2y² = 0

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I need a different approach.

Wait, perhaps instead of trying to solve for variables directly, look for patterns or make substitutions that exploit symmetry.

Looking at the system:

Equation 1: a + b = 1

Equation 2: c + d = √2

Equation 3: e + f = √3

Where a, b, c, d, e, f are square roots as defined before.

But perhaps these equations are similar in form, just scaled differently.

Alternatively, maybe assume that variables are fractions of some sort.

Wait, alternatively, let me consider that in each square root term, the product of variables is involved.

In Equation 1: √(2x - xy) + √(2y - xy) = 1

Note that 2x - xy = x(2 - y), similarly 2y - xy = y(2 - x)

Therefore, each term is a multiple of x and y respectively.

Let me set variables such that p = 2 - x, q = 2 - y, r = 2 - z.

Then x = 2 - p, y = 2 - q, z = 2 - r.

Maybe substituting into the equations will simplify things.

So let me rewrite each equation using p, q, r.

First equation:

√(2x - xy) + √(2y - xy) = 1

Compute 2x - xy:

2x - xy = 2(2 - p) - (2 - p)(2 - q)

= 4 - 2p - [ (2 - p)(2 - q) ]

Compute (2 - p)(2 - q) = 4 - 2p - 2q + pq

So 2x - xy = 4 - 2p - [4 - 2p - 2q + pq] = 4 - 2p -4 + 2p + 2q - pq = 2q - pq

Similarly, 2y - xy = 2q - pq

Wait, same as above? Wait, no, let's compute 2y - xy.

2y - xy = 2(2 - q) - (2 - p)(2 - q) = 4 - 2q - [4 - 2p - 2q + pq] = 4 - 2q -4 + 2p + 2q - pq = 2p - pq

Ah, so 2x - xy = 2q - pq, and 2y - xy = 2p - pq.

Therefore, the first equation becomes:

√(2q - pq) + √(2p - pq) = 1

Similarly, let's do the same substitution for the other equations.

Second equation:

√(2y - yz) + √(2z - yz) = √2

Compute 2y - yz:

2y - yz = 2(2 - q) - (2 - q)(2 - r) = 4 - 2q - [4 - 2q - 2r + qr] = 4 - 2q -4 + 2q + 2r - qr = 2r - qr

Similarly, 2z - yz = 2(2 - r) - (2 - q)(2 - r) = 4 - 2r - [4 - 2q - 2r + qr] = 4 - 2r -4 + 2q + 2r - qr = 2q - qr

So the second equation becomes:

√(2r - qr) + √(2q - qr) = √2

Third equation:

√(2z - zx) + √(2x - zx) = √3

Compute 2z - zx:

2z - zx = 2(2 - r) - (2 - r)(2 - p) = 4 - 2r - [4 - 2r - 2p + pr] = 4 - 2r -4 + 2r + 2p - pr = 2p - pr

Similarly, 2x - zx = 2(2 - p) - (2 - r)(2 - p) = 4 - 2p - [4 - 2p - 2r + pr] = 4 - 2p -4 + 2p + 2r - pr = 2r - pr

So the third equation becomes:

√(2p - pr) + √(2r - pr) = √3

Okay, so now, after substitution, the system looks like:

1. √(2q - pq) + √(2p - pq) = 1

2. √(2r - qr) + √(2q - qr) = √2

3. √(2p - pr) + √(2r - pr) = √3

Hmm, so now, we can denote new variables:

Let’s set:

In equation 1: let’s say s = √(2q - pq), t = √(2p - pq), so s + t = 1

Similarly, equation 2: u = √(2r - qr), v = √(2q - qr), so u + v = √2

Equation 3: w = √(2p - pr), z = √(2r - pr), so w + z = √3

Wait, but maybe noticing some patterns here.

Looking at equation 1: √(2q - pq) + √(2p - pq) = 1

We can factor out sqrt(pq):

Wait, but 2q - pq = q(2 - p) = q*p', but maybe not.

Alternatively, factor out p from the second term:

√(2q - pq) = √[q(2 - p)]

Similarly, √(2p - pq) = √[p(2 - q)]

So equation 1: √[q(2 - p)] + √[p(2 - q)] = 1

Hmm, similar to the original substitution.

Wait, maybe if I set p = q = r? Let me test that idea.

Suppose p = q = r = k. Then check if the equations can be satisfied.

First equation: √[k(2 - k)] + √[k(2 - k)] = 1 => 2√[k(2 - k)] = 1 => √[k(2 - k)] = 1/2 => k(2 - k) = 1/4 => 2k - k² = 1/4 => k² - 2k + 1/4 = 0

Solving quadratic: k = [2 ± √(4 - 1)] / 2 = [2 ± √3]/2

Since k must be positive and less than 2 (since z = 2 - r = 2 - k > 0, so k < 2), both solutions are valid.

But let's plug into equation 2:

√[k(2 - k)] + √[k(2 - k)] = √2 => 2√[k(2 - k)] = √2 => √[k(2 - k)] = √2 / 2

But earlier, when p = q = r = k, √[k(2 - k)] was 1/2, but here it needs to be √2 / 2 ≈ 0.707, which is more than 1/2 ≈ 0.5. So inconsistency.

Hence, p ≠ q ≠ r. So my initial assumption is wrong. So they aren't equal.

Alternative approach: Maybe each pair of variables relates to each other in a specific proportion.

Looking at the first equation: √(2q - pq) + √(2p - pq) = 1

Let me denote A = √(2q - pq), B = √(2p - pq)

So A + B = 1

Also, note that A² = 2q - pq, B² = 2p - pq

So A² - B² = 2q - pq - (2p - pq) = 2(q - p)

But A² - B² = (A - B)(A + B) = (A - B)(1) = A - B

Therefore, A - B = 2(q - p)

But A + B = 1

So we have a system:

A + B = 1

A - B = 2(q - p)

Adding both equations:

2A = 1 + 2(q - p) => A = [1 + 2(q - p)] / 2

Subtracting:

2B = 1 - 2(q - p) => B = [1 - 2(q - p)] / 2

But A and B are square roots, so they must be non-negative.

Therefore,

[1 + 2(q - p)] / 2 ≥ 0 => 1 + 2(q - p) ≥ 0 => q - p ≥ -1/2

and

[1 - 2(q - p)] / 2 ≥ 0 => 1 - 2(q - p) ≥ 0 => q - p ≤ 1/2

So combining, -1/2 ≤ q - p ≤ 1/2

But not sure if helpful yet.

Alternatively, perhaps expressing q in terms of p.

From A² = 2q - pq => 2q - pq = A² => q(2 - p) = A² => q = A² / (2 - p)

Similarly, from B² = 2p - pq => 2p - p q = B² => p(2 - q) = B² => p = B² / (2 - q)

So we can write p and q in terms of each other.

But since we have A + B = 1, and A - B = 2(q - p), perhaps plugging q in terms of p.

Wait, let me express q as A² / (2 - p), so:

A - B = 2(q - p) = 2(A² / (2 - p) - p)

But B = 1 - A, so:

A - (1 - A) = 2(A² / (2 - p) - p)

Simplify left side: 2A - 1 = 2(A² / (2 - p) - p)

Divide both sides by 2:

A - 0.5 = A² / (2 - p) - p

Rearrange:

A² / (2 - p) = A - 0.5 + p

Multiply both sides by (2 - p):

A² = (A - 0.5 + p)(2 - p)

Expand RHS:

= (A - 0.5)(2 - p) + p(2 - p)

= 2A - A p - 1 + 0.5 p + 2p - p²

Combine like terms:

= 2A - A p - 1 + 0.5 p + 2p - p²

= 2A - A p - 1 + 2.5 p - p²

Now, bring all terms to left side:

A² - 2A + A p + 1 - 2.5 p + p² = 0

Hmm, still complex.

Perhaps this isn't the right path.

Wait, maybe we can assume that each equation corresponds to certain proportions.

Looking at equation 1: sum of two square roots is 1.

Equation 2: sum is √2.

Equation 3: sum is √3.

It suggests that as variables increase, the sums increase.

Alternatively, perhaps each pair of variables relates to sin and cos of angles, but not sure.

Alternatively, think of each equation as vectors adding up to a certain magnitude.

Alternatively, think about parametrizing the square roots.

Wait, let me suppose that in equation 1:

Let’s set √(2q - pq) = m, √(2p - pq) = n, so m + n = 1

Similarly, for equation 2: √(2r - qr) = o, √(2q - qr) = p, so o + p = √2

Equation 3: √(2p - pr) = q, √(2r - pr) = s, so q + s = √3

Wait, but variables are overlapping.

Wait, perhaps that complicates matters.

Alternatively, maybe consider ratios.

From equation 1: (√(2q - pq) + √(2p - pq)) = 1

Let’s divide numerator and denominator by √(pq), assuming p and q are positive.

So, set k = √(p/q), then p = k² q

Plug into equation 1:

√(2q - k² q²) + √(2k² q - k² q²) = 1

Factor out q:

√[q(2 - k² q)] + √[k² q(2 - k q)] = 1

Factor further:

√q * √(2 - k² q) + k * √q * √(2 - k q) = 1

Factor out √q:

√q [√(2 - k² q) + k √(2 - k q)] = 1

Hmm, seems even more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps set t = √(2 - p), u = √(2 - q), v = √(2 - r)

But then 2 - p = t², 2 - q = u², 2 - r = v²

So p = 2 - t², q = 2 - u², r = 2 - v²

Then, equation 1 becomes:

√[(2q - pq)] + √[(2p - pq)] = 1

Compute 2q - pq = 2(2 - u²) - (2 - t²)(2 - u²)

= 4 - 2u² - [4 - 2u² - 2t² + t² u²]

= 4 - 2u² -4 + 2u² + 2t² - t² u²

= 2t² - t² u²

Similarly, 2p - pq = 2(2 - t²) - (2 - t²)(2 - u²)

Same as above, which is 2u² - t² u²

Wait, hold on, 2p - pq = 2(2 - t²) - (2 - t²)(2 - u²)

= 4 - 2t² - [4 - 2t² - 2u² + t² u²]

= 4 - 2t² -4 + 2t² + 2u² - t² u²

= 2u² - t² u²

So equation 1 becomes:

√(2t² - t² u²) + √(2u² - t² u²) = 1

Factor out t² and u²:

√[t²(2 - u²)] + √[u²(2 - t²)] = 1

Which simplifies to:

t √(2 - u²) + u √(2 - t²) = 1

Similarly, proceed for equation 2.

Equation 2: √(2r - qr) + √(2q - qr) = √2

Express r = 2 - v², q = 2 - u²

So 2r - qr = 2(2 - v²) - (2 - u²)(2 - v²)

= 4 - 2v² - [4 - 2v² - 2u² + u² v²]

= 4 - 2v² -4 + 2v² + 2u² - u² v²

= 2u² - u² v²

Similarly, 2q - qr = 2(2 - u²) - (2 - u²)(2 - v²)

= 4 - 2u² - [4 - 2u² - 2v² + u² v²]

= 4 - 2u² -4 + 2u² + 2v² - u² v²

= 2v² - u² v²

Thus, equation 2 becomes:

√(2u² - u² v²) + √(2v² - u² v²) = √2

Factor:

√[u²(2 - v²)] + √[v²(2 - u²)] = √2

Which simplifies to:

u √(2 - v²) + v √(2 - u²) = √2

Similarly, equation 3:

√(2p - pr) + √(2r - pr) = √3

With p = 2 - t², r = 2 - v²

Compute 2p - pr = 2(2 - t²) - (2 - t²)(2 - v²)

= 4 - 2t² - [4 - 2t² - 2v² + t² v²]

= 4 - 2t² -4 + 2t² + 2v² - t² v²

= 2v² - t² v²

Similarly, 2r - pr = 2(2 - v²) - (2 - t²)(2 - v²)

= 4 - 2v² - [4 - 2v² - 2t² + t² v²]

= 4 - 2v² -4 + 2v² + 2t² - t² v²

= 2t² - t² v²

Thus, equation 3 becomes:

√(2v² - t² v²) + √(2t² - t² v²) = √3

Factor:

√[v²(2 - t²)] + √[t²(2 - v²)] = √3

Which simplifies to:

v √(2 - t²) + t √(2 - v²) = √3

So now, our transformed equations are:

1. t √(2 - u²) + u √(2 - t²) = 1

2. u √(2 - v²) + v √(2 - u²) = √2

3. v √(2 - t²) + t √(2 - v²) = √3

Hmm, this seems a bit more symmetric.

Notice that each equation has the form: variable1 * sqrt(2 - var2²) + var2 * sqrt(2 - var1²) = constant

So for equation 1: t sqrt(2 - u²) + u sqrt(2 - t²) = 1

Equation 2: u sqrt(2 - v²) + v sqrt(2 - u²) = √2

Equation 3: v sqrt(2 - t²) + t sqrt(2 - v²) = √3

So if we denote:

Let’s define functions:

F(a, b) = a sqrt(2 - b²) + b sqrt(2 - a²)

Then:

F(t, u) = 1

F(u, v) = √2

F(v, t) = √3

Interesting. So cyclic functions.

So F(t, u) = 1

F(u, v) = √2

F(v, t) = √3

So, perhaps, we can write a system:

F(t, u) = 1

F(u, v) = √2

F(v, t) = √3

Now, to solve for t, u, v.

But how?

Alternatively, note that F(a, b) = F(b, a), due to symmetry.

So, F(t, u) = F(u, t). So, in our case, since the function is symmetric, the system is consistent.

But how does that help?

Alternatively, perhaps take the ratio of consecutive equations.

Take equation 2 divided by equation 1:

[F(u, v)] / [F(t, u)] = √2 / 1

Similarly, equation 3 / equation 2: [F(v, t)] / [F(u, v)] = √3 / √2

But without knowing exact expressions, it's hard to take ratios.

Alternatively, maybe consider squaring both sides.

But given the cross terms, it might complicate.

Alternatively, think of F(a, b) as a single variable.

Wait, another idea: Let’s set variables such that a = sqrt(2 - b²), then b = sqrt(2 - a²). But that would imply a = b, which may not hold unless specific conditions.

Alternatively, think of trigonometric substitution.

Suppose that u = sin α, so sqrt(2 - u²) = sqrt(2 - sin² α). Not sure.

Alternatively, set u = tan θ, but might complicate.

Wait, another thought: Let’s suppose that:

Let’s denote:

For equation 1: t sqrt(2 - u²) + u sqrt(2 - t²) = 1

Let’s denote S = t sqrt(2 - u²) + u sqrt(2 - t²) = 1

Similarly, for equation 2: u sqrt(2 - v²) + v sqrt(2 - u²) = √2 = T

Equation 3: v sqrt(2 - t²) + t sqrt(2 - v²) = √3 = U

So, we have S = 1, T = √2, U = √3

Note that S, T, U are cyclically related through t, u, v.

Alternatively, maybe consider each equation as a vector addition.

Alternatively, observe that S, T, U could be thought of as components in different dimensions, but probably overcomplicating.

Wait, maybe think of t, u, v as sines or cosines.

Wait, suppose that t = sin α, u = sin β, v = sin γ

Then sqrt(2 - t²) = sqrt(2 - sin² α), which doesn't simplify nicely.

Alternatively, perhaps hyperbolic functions?

Wait, maybe not.

Another angle: Suppose that t, u, v are all proportional to 1, √2, √3 or something.

Wait, let me hypothesize that t = 1/k, u = √2/k, v = √3/k for some k. Let's see if this works.

But without knowing k, hard to tell.

Alternatively, think about the ratios between the equations.

Equation 1: 1

Equation 2: √2 ≈ 1.414

Equation 3: √3 ≈ 1.732

So increasing.

Perhaps t, u, v are increasing variables.

Alternatively, perhaps t, u, v correspond to angles whose sine/cosine relate to these constants.

Wait, perhaps think of t, u, v as tan(theta) or something.

Alternatively, maybe assign numerical values.

But maybe too vague.

Wait, going back to the equations:

F(t, u) = 1

F(u, v) = √2

F(v, t) = √3

Let me consider writing each equation as:

t sqrt(2 - u²) + u sqrt(2 - t²) = 1

Similarly for others.

Let me attempt to write these equations in matrix form or something, but likely nonlinear.

Alternatively, let's think of t, u, v as variables in a triangle.

Wait, maybe consider that t, u, v are sides of a triangle? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe set t = sin a, u = sin b, etc.

But perhaps better to square the equations.

Let me square equation 1:

[t sqrt(2 - u²) + u sqrt(2 - t²)]² = 1²

Expanding:

t² (2 - u²) + u² (2 - t²) + 2 t u sqrt{(2 - u²)(2 - t²)} = 1

Simplify:

2 t² - t² u² + 2 u² - t² u² + 2 t u sqrt{(2 - u²)(2 - t²)} = 1

Combine like terms:

2 t² + 2 u² - 2 t² u² + 2 t u sqrt{(2 - u²)(2 - t²)} = 1

Hmm, that seems messy, but maybe manageable.

Similarly, square equation 2:

[u sqrt(2 - v²) + v sqrt(2 - u²)]² = (√2)² = 2

Expanding:

u² (2 - v²) + v² (2 - u²) + 2 u v sqrt{(2 - v²)(2 - u²)} = 2

Simplify:

2 u² - u² v² + 2 v² - u² v² + 2 u v sqrt{(2 - v²)(2 - u²)} = 2

Combine:

2 u² + 2 v² - 2 u² v² + 2 u v sqrt{(2 - v²)(2 - u²)} = 2

Similarly, square equation 3:

[v sqrt(2 - t²) + t sqrt(2 - v²)]² = (√3)² = 3

Expanding:

v² (2 - t²) + t² (2 - v²) + 2 v t sqrt{(2 - t²)(2 - v²)} = 3

Simplify:

2 v² - v² t² + 2 t² - v² t² + 2 v t sqrt{(2 - t²)(2 - v²)} = 3

Combine:

2 v² + 2 t² - 2 v² t² + 2 v t sqrt{(2 - t²)(2 - v²)} = 3

So now, we have three squared equations:

1. 2 t² + 2 u² - 2 t² u² + 2 t u sqrt{(2 - u²)(2 - t²)} = 1

2. 2 u² + 2 v² - 2 u² v² + 2 u v sqrt{(2 - v²)(2 - u²)} = 2

3. 2 v² + 2 t² - 2 v² t² + 2 v t sqrt{(2 - t²)(2 - v²)} = 3

These are still quite complex, but perhaps we can denote some common terms.

Let’s denote Q = sqrt{(2 - u²)(2 - t²)}, R = sqrt{(2 - v²)(2 - u²)}, S = sqrt{(2 - t²)(2 - v²)}

Then equations become:

1. 2 t² + 2 u² - 2 t² u² + 2 t u Q = 1

2. 2 u² + 2 v² - 2 u² v² + 2 u v R = 2

3. 2 v² + 2 t² - 2 v² t² + 2 v t S = 3

Additionally, note that:

Q² = (2 - u²)(2 - t²)

R² = (2 - v²)(2 - u²)

S² = (2 - t²)(2 - v²)

So, perhaps express these in terms of Q, R, S.

But this seems to lead us into more complex equations.

Alternatively, perhaps subtract equations to eliminate variables.

Alternatively, notice that equations 1, 2, 3 have similar structures, so perhaps the solution involves similar steps for each.

Alternatively, let me think numerically.

Given that the equations result in 1, √2, √3, which are known constants, perhaps t, u, v have simple forms.

Wait, maybe t = 1/√2, u = 1, v = √2.

Testing t = 1/√2 ≈ 0.707

u = 1

v = √2 ≈ 1.414

Check equation 1:

F(t, u) = t sqrt(2 - u²) + u sqrt(2 - t²)

= (1/√2) sqrt(2 - 1) + 1 sqrt(2 - (1/2))

= (1/√2)(1) + 1*(√(3/2))

= 1/√2 + √(3)/√2

≈ 0.707 + 1.225 ≈ 1.932, which is greater than 1. So not matching.

Alternatively, try t = 1/2, u = √2/2, v = ?

Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps t = sin 30° = 1/2, u = sin 60° = √3/2, v = ?

But testing:

F(t, u) = (1/2) sqrt(2 - (√3/2)^2) + (√3/2) sqrt(2 - (1/2)^2)

= (1/2) sqrt(2 - 3/4) + (√3/2) sqrt(2 - 1/4)

= (1/2) sqrt(5/4) + (√3/2) sqrt(7/4)

= (1/2)(√5 / 2) + (√3 / 2)(√7 / 2)

= √5 / 4 + √21 / 4 ≈ (2.236 + 4.583)/4 ≈ 6.819 /4 ≈ 1.705, which is still higher than 1.

Hmm, not good.

Alternatively, maybe smaller t, u, v.

Suppose t = u = v = k

Then equation 1: 2k sqrt(2 - k²) = 1

Equation 2: 2k sqrt(2 - k²) = √2

But 2k sqrt(2 - k²) cannot simultaneously equal 1 and √2, so contradiction.

So variables are different.

Alternatively, perhaps t, u, v are in geometric progression.

Suppose u = t * r, v = t * r²

But not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps think of the system as a chain, each equation depending on next variable.

But it's cyclic, so it's challenging.

Wait, maybe use substitution.

From equation 1: t sqrt(2 - u²) + u sqrt(2 - t²) = 1

Let me denote A = t sqrt(2 - u²), B = u sqrt(2 - t²), so A + B = 1

From equation 2: u sqrt(2 - v²) + v sqrt(2 - u²) = √2

Denote C = u sqrt(2 - v²), D = v sqrt(2 - u²), so C + D = √2

From equation 3: v sqrt(2 - t²) + t sqrt(2 - v²) = √3

Denote E = v sqrt(2 - t²), F = t sqrt(2 - v²), so E + F = √3

Now, note that:

From equation 1: A = 1 - B, where A = t sqrt(2 - u²), B = u sqrt(2 - t²)

From equation 2: C = √2 - D, where C = u sqrt(2 - v²), D = v sqrt(2 - u²)

From equation 3: E = √3 - F, where E = v sqrt(2 - t²), F = t sqrt(2 - v²)

But notice that:

From equation 1: A = t sqrt(2 - u²)

From equation 3: E = v sqrt(2 - t²)

From equation 2: C = u sqrt(2 - v²)

From equation 3: E = v sqrt(2 - t²) = same as equation 1's sqrt(2 - t²) term.

Wait, confusing.

Wait, note that from equation 1: A = t sqrt(2 - u²); from equation 2: D = v sqrt(2 - u²); from equation 3: F = t sqrt(2 - v²)

So, we have:

A = t sqrt(2 - u²)

D = v sqrt(2 - u²)

F = t sqrt(2 - v²)

Also, B = u sqrt(2 - t²)

C = u sqrt(2 - v²)

E = v sqrt(2 - t²)

But this is getting tangled.

Alternatively, maybe express ratios:

From equation 1: A / B = t / u * sqrt(2 - u²) / sqrt(2 - t²) = (t / u) * sqrt{(2 - u²)/(2 - t²)}

But since A + B = 1, and C + D = √2, E + F = √3, this might not help directly.

Alternatively, consider taking equation 1 and equation 3:

From equation 1: t sqrt(2 - u²) + u sqrt(2 - t²) = 1

From equation 3: v sqrt(2 - t²) + t sqrt(2 - v²) = √3

Notice that both have t sqrt(2 - t²) as a term.

Let me denote K = t sqrt(2 - t²)

Then equation 1: t sqrt(2 - u²) + u sqrt(2 - t²) = 1

But wait, K is t sqrt(2 - t²). Similarly, define M = u sqrt(2 - u²), N = v sqrt(2 - v²)

Then, equation 1: t sqrt(2 - u²) + u sqrt(2 - t²) = ?

But not sure.

Alternatively, if K = t sqrt(2 - t²), L = u sqrt(2 - u²), M = v sqrt(2 - v²)

Then, equation 1: t sqrt(2 - u²) + u sqrt(2 - t²) = 1

Equation 2: u sqrt(2 - v²) + v sqrt(2 - u²) = √2

Equation 3: v sqrt(2 - t²) + t sqrt(2 - v²) = √3

But we can write:

Equation 1: t sqrt(2 - u²) + u sqrt(2 - t²) = 1

Equation 2: u sqrt(2 - v²) + v sqrt(2 - u²) = √2

Equation 3: v sqrt(2 - t²) + t sqrt(2 - v²) = √3

Now, note that each equation has a term like (variable) * sqrt(2 - (next variable)^2) plus (next variable) * sqrt(2 - (prev variable)^2)

So, cyclic dependencies.

Perhaps, if we denote each term as:

Let’s define:

a = t sqrt(2 - u²)

b = u sqrt(2 - v²)

c = v sqrt(2 - t²)

Then, equation 1: a + something = 1

Wait, actually, equation 1: a + d = 1, where d = u sqrt(2 - t²)

Similarly, equation 2: b + e = √2, where e = v sqrt(2 - u²)

Equation 3: c + f = √3, where f = t sqrt(2 - v²)

But it's unclear.

Alternatively, maybe consider arranging the equations:

From equation 1: a + d = 1

From equation 2: b + e = √2

From equation 3: c + f = √3

But a = t sqrt(2 - u²); d = u sqrt(2 - t²)

Similarly, b = u sqrt(2 - v²); e = v sqrt(2 - u²)

c = v sqrt(2 - t²); f = t sqrt(2 - v²)

So, a = t sqrt(2 - u²); e = v sqrt(2 - u²); so a = (t / v) e

Similarly, b = u sqrt(2 - v²); f = t sqrt(2 - v²); so b = (u / t) f

And c = v sqrt(2 - t²); d = u sqrt(2 - t²); so c = (v / u) d

But not sure if this helps.

Alternatively, note that a * e = t sqrt(2 - u²) * v sqrt(2 - u²) = t v (2 - u²)

Similarly, b * f = u sqrt(2 - v²) * t sqrt(2 - v²) = u t (2 - v²)

c * d = v sqrt(2 - t²) * u sqrt(2 - t²) = u v (2 - t²)

But these products are t v (2 - u²), u t (2 - v²), u v (2 - t²)

Hmm, which are similar to variables multiplied by constants.

Alternatively, perhaps use substitution.

Wait, given the time spent, maybe it's better to consider that the problem is symmetric enough that perhaps (1 - x)(1 - y)(1 - z) can be expressed as a product, and then its square is m/n.

But considering the answer requires it to be squared, perhaps it's a rational number.

Alternatively, think of (1 - x)(1 - y)(1 - z) as a volume, but not sure.

Alternatively, note that:

From the first equation, √(2x - xy) + √(2y - xy) = 1

Let me denote s = √x, t = √y, so x = s², y = t².

Then, 2x - xy = 2s² - s² t² = s² (2 - t²)

Similarly, 2y - xy = 2t² - s² t² = t² (2 - s²)

So equation becomes:

s sqrt(2 - t²) + t sqrt(2 - s²) = 1

Similarly, let’s denote s = sin α, t = sin β, where α, β ∈ (0, π/2)

Then sqrt(2 - s²) = sqrt(2 - sin² α), which is not a standard identity.

But maybe approximate or see if for specific angles.

Alternatively, consider that 2 - sin² α = 1 + cos² α, but not helpful.

Alternatively, set s = sqrt(2) sin α, t = sqrt(2) sin β, but scaling.

Wait, let me try.

Let’s set s = sqrt(2) sin α, so sqrt(2 - s²) = sqrt(2 - 2 sin² α) = sqrt(2 cos² α) = sqrt(2) cos α

Similarly, t = sqrt(2) sin β, so sqrt(2 - t²) = sqrt(2) cos β

So equation becomes:

sqrt(2) sin α * sqrt(2) cos β + sqrt(2) sin β * sqrt(2) cos α = 1

Simplify:

2 sin α cos β + 2 sin β cos α = 1

Factor:

2(sin α cos β + sin β cos α) = 1

Which is:

2 sin(α + β) = 1 => sin(α + β) = 1/2

Thus, α + β = π/6 or 5π/6

But since α, β are in (0, π/2), their sum is in (0, π). So possible solutions are π/6 and 5π/6.

Similarly, proceeding to equation 2:

√(2y - yz) + √(2z - yz) = √2

Using the same substitution, but now with y = t² and z = u², let’s denote t = sqrt(2) sin β, u = sqrt(2) sin gamma

Then, sqrt(2y - yz) = sqrt(2 t² - t² u²) = t sqrt(2 - u²) = sqrt(2) sin β * sqrt(2 - u²)

Similarly, sqrt(2z - yz) = sqrt(2 u² - t² u²) = u sqrt(2 - t²) = sqrt(2) sin gamma * sqrt(2 - t²)

Thus, equation 2 becomes:

sqrt(2) sin β * sqrt(2 - u²) + sqrt(2) sin gamma * sqrt(2 - t²) = √2

Divide both sides by sqrt(2):

sin β sqrt(2 - u²) + sin gamma sqrt(2 - t²) = 1

But from the first substitution, we had similar expressions.

Wait, but t = sqrt(2) sin beta, u = sqrt(2) sin gamma

So sqrt(2 - u²) = sqrt(2 - 2 sin² gamma) = sqrt(2 cos² gamma) = sqrt(2) cos gamma

Similarly, sqrt(2 - t²) = sqrt(2) cos beta

Therefore, equation 2 becomes:

sin beta * sqrt(2) cos gamma + sin gamma * sqrt(2) cos beta = 1

Which is sqrt(2)(sin beta cos gamma + sin gamma cos beta) = 1

So sqrt(2) sin(beta + gamma) = 1 => sin(beta + gamma) = 1/√2

Thus, beta + gamma = π/4 or 3π/4

Similarly, proceeding to equation 3:

√(2z - zx) + √(2x - zx) = √3

Again, with z = u², x = s², s = sqrt(2) sin alpha, u = sqrt(2) sin gamma

Thus, sqrt(2z - zx) = sqrt(2 u² - u² s²) = u sqrt(2 - s²) = sqrt(2) sin gamma * sqrt(2 - s²)

Similarly, sqrt(2x - zx) = sqrt(2 s² - s² u²) = s sqrt(2 - u²) = sqrt(2) sin alpha * sqrt(2 - u²)

Thus, equation 3 becomes:

sqrt(2) sin gamma * sqrt(2 - s²) + sqrt(2) sin alpha * sqrt(2 - u²) = √3

Again, using substitution:

sqrt(2 - s²) = sqrt(2 - 2 sin² alpha) = sqrt(2) cos alpha

sqrt(2 - u²) = sqrt(2) cos gamma

Thus, equation 3 becomes:

sqrt(2) sin gamma * sqrt(2) cos alpha + sqrt(2) sin alpha * sqrt(2) cos gamma = √3

Simplify:

2 (sin gamma cos alpha + sin alpha cos gamma) = √3

Thus,

2 sin(alpha + gamma) = √3 => sin(alpha + gamma) = √3 / 2

Therefore, alpha + gamma = π/3 or 2π/3

So, summarizing:

From equation 1: α + β = π/6 or 5π/6

From equation 2: β + gamma = π/4 or 3π/4

From equation 3: alpha + gamma = π/3 or 2π/3

Now, since alpha, beta, gamma are positive angles adding to more than each individual angle, but each is less than pi/2, so their sum is less than 3pi/2.

So, the possibilities:

Case 1:

Equation 1: α + β = π/6

Equation 2: β + gamma = π/4

Equation 3: alpha + gamma = π/3

Let’s solve this system.

From equation 1: alpha = π/6 - beta

From equation 2: gamma = π/4 - beta

From equation 3: alpha + gamma = π/3

Substitute alpha and gamma:

(pi/6 - beta) + (pi/4 - beta) = pi/3

Simplify:

pi/6 + pi/4 - 2 beta = pi/3

Compute pi/6 + pi/4 = (2pi + 3pi)/12 = 5pi/12

Thus:

5pi/12 - 2 beta = pi/3

Convert pi/3 to 4pi/12:

5pi/12 - 2 beta = 4pi/12

Subtract:

5pi/12 - 4pi/12 = 2 beta

pi/12 = 2 beta => beta = pi/24

Thus, beta = pi/24

Then, alpha = pi/6 - pi/24 = (4pi - pi)/24 = 3pi/24 = pi/8

Gamma = pi/4 - pi/24 = (6pi - pi)/24 = 5pi/24

So, angles are:

alpha = pi/8, beta = pi/24, gamma = 5pi/24

Check if these satisfy equation 3:

alpha + gamma = pi/8 + 5pi/24 = (3pi + 5pi)/24 = 8pi/24 = pi/3, which matches.

Good.

Case 2:

Equation 1: alpha + beta = 5pi/6

Equation 2: beta + gamma = 3pi/4

Equation 3: alpha + gamma = 2pi/3

Let’s solve this.

From equation 1: alpha = 5pi/6 - beta

From equation 2: gamma = 3pi/4 - beta

From equation 3: alpha + gamma = 2pi/3

Substitute:

(5pi/6 - beta) + (3pi/4 - beta) = 2pi/3

Simplify:

5pi/6 + 3pi/4 - 2 beta = 2pi/3

Convert to twelfths:

5pi/6 = 10pi/12

3pi/4 = 9pi/12

2pi/3 = 8pi/12

Thus:

10pi/12 + 9pi/12 - 2 beta = 8pi/12

Sum: 19pi/12 - 2 beta = 8pi/12

Subtract:

19pi/12 - 8pi/12 = 2 beta => 11pi/12 = 2 beta => beta = 11pi/24

But then, alpha = 5pi/6 - 11pi/24 = (20pi - 11pi)/24 = 9pi/24 = 3pi/8

Gamma = 3pi/4 - 11pi/24 = (18pi - 11pi)/24 = 7pi/24

Check equation 3: alpha + gamma = 3pi/8 + 7pi/24 = (9pi + 7pi)/24 = 16pi/24 = 2pi/3, which matches.

So, another solution is alpha = 3pi/8, beta = 11pi/24, gamma = 7pi/24

Both cases seem valid.

So, whether Case 1 or Case 2, we have valid angles.

But let's verify which case fits.

Compute t, u, v.

Recall:

t = sqrt(2) sin beta

s = sqrt(2) sin alpha

u = sqrt(2) sin gamma

v = sqrt(2) sin delta? Wait, no, need to track variables.

Wait, no, in the substitution, we set s = sqrt(2) sin alpha, t = sqrt(2) sin beta, u = sqrt(2) sin gamma.

Thus, for Case 1:

s = sqrt(2) sin(pi/8)

t = sqrt(2) sin(pi/24)

u = sqrt(2) sin(5pi/24)

Similarly, for Case 2:

s = sqrt(2) sin(3pi/8)

t = sqrt(2) sin(11pi/24)

u = sqrt(2) sin(7pi/24)

But wait, in equation 3, we have v involved. Wait, no, in substitution, we had s, t, u.

Wait, no, actually in the substitution, we have three variables s, t, u corresponding to sqrt(x), sqrt(y), sqrt(z). Therefore, the values above are x, y, z.

Wait, no, sorry, s = sqrt(x), t = sqrt(y), u = sqrt(z). Therefore, x = s², y = t², z = u².

Therefore, in Case 1:

x = (sqrt(2) sin(pi/8))² = 2 sin²(pi/8)

Similarly,

y = 2 sin²(pi/24)

z = 2 sin²(5pi/24)

In Case 2:

x = 2 sin²(3pi/8)

y = 2 sin²(11pi/24)

z = 2 sin²(7pi/24)

Now, need to compute (1 - x)(1 - y)(1 - z)

Compute 1 - x = 1 - 2 sin²(pi/8) = cos(2 * pi/8) = cos(pi/4) = √2 / 2

Similarly, 1 - y = cos(pi/12), because 1 - 2 sin²(theta) = cos(2 theta). So:

1 - x = cos(pi/4) = √2 / 2

1 - y = cos(pi/12)

1 - z = cos(5pi/12)

Thus, (1 - x)(1 - y)(1 - z) = (√2 / 2) * cos(pi/12) * cos(5pi/12)

Similarly, in Case 2:

1 - x = cos(3pi/8)

1 - y = cos(11pi/12)

1 - z = cos(7pi/12)

But cos(11pi/12) is negative, since 11pi/12 is in second quadrant, but 1 - y must be positive, as y is positive. Thus, cos(11pi/12) is negative, which would make (1 - y) negative, which can’t be since y is positive, so 1 - y must be positive. Therefore, 1 - y > 0 => y < 1. Since y = 2 sin²(theta), and theta is small (pi/24, 11pi/24, etc.), y is less than 1, so 1 - y is positive.

Wait, but 11pi/12 is 165 degrees, cos(165 degrees) is negative, but 1 - y = cos(11pi/12) is negative, implying 1 - y < 0, which would mean y > 1, but y = 2 sin²(theta), theta being 11pi/24 (~82.5 degrees), sin(theta) ~0.991, so y ~ 2*(0.991)^2 ~1.96, which is greater than 1, making 1 - y negative.

But since (1 - y) must be positive (as per original equation, 1 - y is under square root?), wait, no, in the original variables, x, y, z are positive reals, but 1 - x, 1 - y, 1 - z may be positive or negative.

But in the problem statement, since square roots are involved, 2x - xy must be non-negative, as must 2y - xy, etc. Therefore, 2x >= xy => y <= 2, similarly, 2y >= yz => z <= 2, etc. So, x, y, z <= 2.

But in Case 2, y = 2 sin²(11pi/24). Compute sin(11pi/24): 11pi/24 is ~82.5 degrees, sin(82.5) ~0.9914, so y ~2*(0.9914)^2 ~1.96, which is less than 2, so acceptable.

Similarly, z = 2 sin²(7pi/24). 7pi/24 ~52.5 degrees, sin ~0.7939, y ~2*(0.7939)^2 ~1.26, which is fine.

So, even though 1 - y is positive in Case 2, because y ~1.96, 1 - y ~-0.96, which is negative. Which would be invalid, as square roots of negative numbers are not real.

Therefore, Case 2 leads to negative terms in (1 - y), which is impossible because we’re dealing with real numbers. Hence, Case 2 is invalid.

Therefore, only Case 1 is valid.

Thus, in Case 1:

(1 - x)(1 - y)(1 - z) = (√2 / 2) * cos(pi/12) * cos(5pi/12)

Compute this product.

First, note that pi/12 = 15°, 5pi/12 = 75°, so cos(pi/12) = cos(15°) = (√6 + √2)/4

cos(5pi/12) = cos(75°) = (√6 - √2)/4

Therefore,

cos(pi/12) * cos(5pi/12) = [(√6 + √2)/4] * [(√6 - √2)/4] = [(√6)^2 - (√2)^2]/16 = (6 - 2)/16 = 4/16 = 1/4

Thus,

(1 - x)(1 - y)(1 - z) = (√2 / 2) * (1/4) = √2 / 8

Hence, [(1 - x)(1 - y)(1 - z)]² = (√2 / 8)^2 = (2)/64 = 1/32

Thus, m = 1, n = 32, which are coprime.

Therefore, m + n = 1 + 32 = 33

**Final Answer**
\boxed{33}
</think>

Given the system of equations involving positive real numbers \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\):

\[
\begin{align*}
\sqrt{2x - xy} + \sqrt{2y - xy} &= 1 \\
\sqrt{2y - yz} + \sqrt{2z - yz} &= \sqrt{2} \\
\sqrt{2z - zx} + \sqrt{2x - zx} &= \sqrt{3}
\end{align*}
\]

we aim to find \([(1 - x)(1 - y)(1 - z)]^2\) and express it as \(\frac{m}{n}\) where \(m\) and \(n\) are relatively prime positive integers.

First, we rewrite each equation by factoring out common terms:

1. \(\sqrt{x(2 - y)} + \sqrt{y(2 - x)} = 1\)
2. \(\sqrt{y(2 - z)} + \sqrt{z(2 - y)} = \sqrt{2}\)
3. \(\sqrt{z(2 - x)} + \sqrt{x(2 - z)} = \sqrt{3}\)

We then introduce substitutions \(s = \sqrt{2} \sin \alpha\), \(t = \sqrt{2} \sin \beta\), and \(u = \sqrt{2} \sin \gamma\) to transform the equations into trigonometric identities. Solving these trigonometric equations, we find that:

- \(\alpha = \frac{\pi}{8}\)
- \(\beta = \frac{\pi}{24}\)
- \(\gamma = \frac{5\pi}{24}\)

Using these angles, we compute the values of \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) as follows:

- \(x = 2 \sin^2(\frac{\pi}{8})\)
- \(y = 2 \sin^2(\frac{\pi}{24})\)
- \(z = 2 \sin^2(\frac{5\pi}{24})\)

Next, we calculate \(1 - x\), \(1 - y\), and \(1 - z\) using trigonometric identities:

- \(1 - x = \cos(\frac{\pi}{4}) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\)
- \(1 - y = \cos(\frac{\pi}{12})\)
- \(1 - z = \cos(\frac{5\pi}{12})\)

We find that:

- \(\cos(\frac{\pi}{12}) = \frac{\sqrt{6} + \sqrt{2}}{4}\)
- \(\cos(\frac{5\pi}{12}) = \frac{\sqrt{6} - \sqrt{2}}{4}\)

Multiplying these results:

\[
(1 - x)(1 - y)(1 - z) = \left(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{\sqrt{6} + \sqrt{2}}{4}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{\sqrt{6} - \sqrt{2}}{4}\right)
\]

Simplifying, we find:

\[
(1 - x)(1 - y)(1 - z) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{8}
\]

Thus, squaring this product:

\[
[(1 - x)(1 - y)(1 - z)]^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{32}
\]

Therefore, \(m = 1\) and \(n = 32\), leading to \(m + n = 33\).

\[
\boxed{33}
\]
