Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \boxed{}. Provide only one \boxed{}.
 The problem: 
Let $x,$ $y,$ and $z$ be positive real numbers satisfying the system of equations:
\begin{align*} \sqrt{2x-xy} + \sqrt{2y-xy} &= 1 \\ \sqrt{2y-yz} + \sqrt{2z-yz} &= \sqrt2 \\ \sqrt{2z-zx} + \sqrt{2x-zx} &= \sqrt3. \end{align*} 
Then $\left[ (1-x)(1-y)(1-z) \right]^2$ can be written as $\frac{m}{n},$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n.$


Alright, so I have this problem with three equations involving square roots and variables x, y, z. It looks a bit intimidating at first, but maybe if I break it down step by step, I can figure it out.

First, let me write down the equations to get a clear picture:

1. √(2x - xy) + √(2y - xy) = 1
2. √(2y - yz) + √(2z - yz) = √2
3. √(2z - zx) + √(2x - zx) = √3

And we need to find [(1 - x)(1 - y)(1 - z)]² expressed as m/n, then find m + n where m and n are coprime.

Hmm, okay. So each equation has two square roots, each involving two variables multiplied together. Maybe there's a pattern or substitution that can help here.

Looking closer, each square root term is of the form √(2a - ab), where a and b are variables from the set {x, y, z}. For example, in the first equation, a is x and the other variable is y; similarly for the others.

I wonder if setting variables like u = 1 - x, v = 1 - y, w = 1 - z might simplify things? Because the expression we need is [(1 - x)(1 - y)(1 - z)]², which would then become (uvw)². Not sure yet, but it's something to consider.

Alternatively, maybe I can manipulate each equation individually. Let me take the first equation:

√(2x - xy) + √(2y - xy) = 1.

Notice that both terms under the square roots have a common factor of (2 - b)a, where a and b are variables. Wait, not quite. Let me see:

In the first equation, 2x - xy = x(2 - y). Similarly, 2y - xy = y(2 - x).

So the equation becomes:

√[x(2 - y)] + √[y(2 - x)] = 1.

Similarly, the second equation:

√[y(2 - z)] + √[z(2 - y)] = √2.

Third equation:

√[z(2 - x)] + √[x(2 - z)] = √3.

Okay, that seems more symmetric. Each equation involves two variables, and the expressions inside the square roots are products of each variable with (2 minus the other variable).

Maybe if I let a = 2 - x, b = 2 - y, c = 2 - z, but wait, no, because x, y, z are positive reals, so 2 - x, etc., could be positive or negative depending on x, y, z.

Wait, but looking back at the original expressions under the square roots, they must be non-negative because square roots of negative numbers aren't real. So, 2x - xy ≥ 0, 2y - xy ≥ 0, etc.

So, for 2x - xy ≥ 0 ⇒ x(2 - y) ≥ 0. Since x is positive, 2 - y ≥ 0 ⇒ y ≤ 2.

Similarly, from 2y - xy ≥ 0 ⇒ y(2 - x) ≥ 0, so x ≤ 2.

Same logic applies to all variables: x, y, z ≤ 2.

Therefore, 2 - x, 2 - y, 2 - z are all non-negative, so substituting a = 2 - x, b = 2 - y, c = 2 - z would give us a, b, c ≥ 0. That might be helpful.

Let me try that substitution:

Let a = 2 - x, so x = 2 - a

b = 2 - y, so y = 2 - b

c = 2 - z, so z = 2 - c

Since x, y, z ≤ 2, a, b, c ≥ 0.

Now, substitute into the first equation:

√[x(2 - y)] + √[y(2 - x)] = 1.

Substituting x = 2 - a, y = 2 - b:

√[(2 - a)(2 - (2 - b))] + √[(2 - b)(2 - (2 - a))] = 1

Simplify the terms inside:

First term inside sqrt: (2 - a)(2 - 2 + b) = (2 - a)(b)

Second term inside sqrt: (2 - b)(2 - 2 + a) = (2 - b)(a)

So, equation becomes:

√[(2 - a)b] + √[(2 - b)a] = 1.

Hmm, interesting. Similarly, let me rewrite the other equations.

Second equation:

√[y(2 - z)] + √[z(2 - y)] = √2.

Substituting y = 2 - b, z = 2 - c:

√[(2 - b)(2 - (2 - c))] + √[(2 - c)(2 - (2 - b))] = √2.

Simplify:

√[(2 - b)c] + √[(2 - c)b] = √2.

Third equation:

√[z(2 - x)] + √[x(2 - z)] = √3.

Substituting z = 2 - c, x = 2 - a:

√[(2 - c)(2 - (2 - a))] + √[(2 - a)(2 - (2 - c))] = √3.

Simplify:

√[(2 - c)a] + √[(2 - a)c] = √3.

So now, our transformed system is:

1. √[(2 - a)b] + √[(2 - b)a] = 1

2. √[(2 - b)c] + √[(2 - c)b] = √2

3. √[(2 - c)a] + √[(2 - a)c] = √3

This seems symmetric, but I'm not sure how to proceed yet. Maybe I can denote some terms as variables?

Let me define:

Let’s set:

Equation 1: √[b(2 - a)] + √[a(2 - b)] = 1

Equation 2: √[c(2 - b)] + √[b(2 - c)] = √2

Equation 3: √[a(2 - c)] + √[c(2 - a)] = √3

Hmm, perhaps I can consider variables p = √[a(2 - b)], q = √[b(2 - a)] so that p + q = 1.

Similarly, for equation 2: let r = √[c(2 - b)], s = √[b(2 - c)] so that r + s = √2.

For equation 3: t = √[a(2 - c)], u = √[c(2 - a)] so that t + u = √3.

But this seems to complicate things further. Maybe another approach.

Alternatively, suppose I consider squaring both sides of each equation to eliminate the square roots. Let me try that.

Starting with equation 1:

√[(2 - a)b] + √[(2 - b)a] = 1.

Square both sides:

[√((2 - a)b) + √((2 - b)a)]² = 1²

Which expands to:

(2 - a)b + 2√[(2 - a)b(2 - b)a] + (2 - b)a = 1

Simplify:

(2 - a)b + (2 - b)a + 2√[ab(2 - a)(2 - b)] = 1

Compute (2 - a)b + (2 - b)a:

= 2b - ab + 2a - ab

= 2a + 2b - 2ab

Thus, equation becomes:

2a + 2b - 2ab + 2√[ab(2 - a)(2 - b)] = 1

Divide everything by 2:

a + b - ab + √[ab(2 - a)(2 - b)] = 1/2

Hmm, still complicated. Let's see what we can do.

Let me denote k = ab(2 - a)(2 - b). Then the equation is:

a + b - ab + √k = 1/2

Not sure. Maybe trying similar steps with equation 2.

Equation 2: √[(2 - b)c] + √[(2 - c)b] = √2.

Square both sides:

[(2 - b)c + 2√{(2 - b)c(2 - c)b}] + (2 - c)b = (√2)² = 2

Simplify:

(2 - b)c + (2 - c)b + 2√{bc(2 - b)(2 - c)} = 2

Compute (2 - b)c + (2 - c)b:

= 2c - bc + 2b - bc

= 2b + 2c - 2bc

Thus:

2b + 2c - 2bc + 2√{bc(2 - b)(2 - c)} = 2

Divide by 2:

b + c - bc + √{bc(2 - b)(2 - c)} = 1

Similarly, equation 3:

√[(2 - c)a] + √[(2 - a)c] = √3.

Square both sides:

[(2 - c)a + 2√{(2 - c)a(2 - a)c}] + (2 - a)c = 3

Simplify:

(2 - c)a + (2 - a)c + 2√{ac(2 - c)(2 - a)} = 3

Compute (2 - c)a + (2 - a)c:

= 2a - ac + 2c - ac

= 2a + 2c - 2ac

Thus:

2a + 2c - 2ac + 2√{ac(2 - c)(2 - a)} = 3

Divide by 2:

a + c - ac + √{ac(2 - c)(2 - a)} = 3/2

So now, after squaring, we have:

From equation 1:

a + b - ab + √[ab(2 - a)(2 - b)] = 1/2

From equation 2:

b + c - bc + √{bc(2 - b)(2 - c)} = 1

From equation 3:

a + c - ac + √{ac(2 - c)(2 - a)} = 3/2

Hmm, these are getting more complex, but maybe there's a pattern here.

Each equation has the form:

variable1 + variable2 - (variable1)(variable2) + sqrt[something] = constant.

Perhaps if I denote:

Let’s define S1 = a + b - ab,

S2 = b + c - bc,

S3 = a + c - ac.

And the square roots as R1 = √[ab(2 - a)(2 - b)],

R2 = √{bc(2 - b)(2 - c)},

R3 = √{ac(2 - c)(2 - a)}.

So, the equations become:

1. S1 + R1 = 1/2

2. S2 + R2 = 1

3. S3 + R3 = 3/2

I wonder if there's a relationship between R1, R2, R3 and S1, S2, S3.

Looking at R1: √[ab(2 - a)(2 - b)]

Note that ab(2 - a)(2 - b) can be rewritten as [a(2 - a)][b(2 - b)].

Which is similar to the product of two quadratic expressions.

Similarly, for R2: √[bc(2 - b)(2 - c)] = √[b(2 - b)][c(2 - c)]

And R3: √[ac(2 - a)(2 - c)] = √[a(2 - a)][c(2 - c)]

Hmm, so R1, R2, R3 are geometric means of pairs of terms from a(2 - a), b(2 - b), c(2 - c).

That makes me think that maybe we can relate R1, R2, R3 to each other through these products.

Also, note that S1 = a + b - ab, which is equal to (a(2 - a) + b(2 - b))/2 ?

Wait, let me compute a(2 - a) = 2a - a²

Similarly, b(2 - b) = 2b - b²

But S1 = a + b - ab.

Is there a relation between S1 and a(2 - a) and b(2 - b)?

Let me see: If I add a(2 - a) + b(2 - b) = 2a - a² + 2b - b²

Compare to 2*(a + b - ab) = 2a + 2b - 2ab

Not exactly the same, but close.

Wait, 2*(a + b - ab) = 2a + 2b - 2ab.

On the other hand, a(2 - a) + b(2 - b) = 2a - a² + 2b - b².

So, 2*(a + b - ab) = a(2 - a) + b(2 - b) + (something?)

Wait, no. Let me subtract them:

[2a + 2b - 2ab] - [2a - a² + 2b - b²] = (-2ab) - (-a² - b²) = -2ab + a² + b².

So, 2*(a + b - ab) = a(2 - a) + b(2 - b) + (a² + b² - 2ab)

But a² + b² - 2ab = (a - b)^2, which is non-negative.

So, 2*(a + b - ab) = a(2 - a) + b(2 - b) + (a - b)^2.

Hence, 2*S1 = a(2 - a) + b(2 - b) + (a - b)^2.

But since (a - b)^2 is non-negative, 2*S1 ≥ a(2 - a) + b(2 - b).

Similarly, for other terms.

But I don't know if that helps directly.

Alternatively, maybe assuming symmetry in a, b, c? But given the different constants on the right-hand side after squaring, it's unlikely that a, b, c are equal.

Alternatively, perhaps we can assume that a, b, c follow certain ratios or something.

Wait, another thought: The expressions under the square roots in R1, R2, R3 involve products of two variables times their respective (2 - variable). Maybe if I set u = a(2 - a), v = b(2 - b), w = c(2 - c), then R1 = √(uv), R2 = √(vw), R3 = √(wu).

Interesting! So, R1 = √(uv), R2 = √(vw), R3 = √(wu).

So, if I let u = a(2 - a), v = b(2 - b), w = c(2 - c), then:

R1 = √(uv)

R2 = √(vw)

R3 = √(wu)

So, in terms of u, v, w, our squared equations become:

1. S1 + √(uv) = 1/2

2. S2 + √(vw) = 1

3. S3 + √(wu) = 3/2

Where S1 = a + b - ab,

But also, since u = a(2 - a), and similar for v, w.

Wait, perhaps expressing S1 in terms of u and v?

Let me see: S1 = a + b - ab.

But u = a(2 - a) ⇒ u = 2a - a².

Similarly, v = 2b - b².

So, 2a - a² = u ⇒ a² - 2a + u = 0 ⇒ a = [2 ± √(4 - 4u)] / 2 = 1 ± √(1 - u).

Similarly, b = 1 ± √(1 - v), c = 1 ± √(1 - w).

But since a, b, c are non-negative and less than or equal to 2, probably 1 ± √(1 - u). Hmm, but which sign?

If u is small, say u approaches 0, then a approaches 0 or 2. But since a is positive, and likely between 0 and 2, perhaps a = 1 - √(1 - u) or a = 1 + √(1 - u). Hmm, let's test:

Suppose u = 0: Then a(2 - a) = 0 ⇒ a = 0 or a = 2.

If a = 0, then u = 0.

But if a = 2, u = 2*(0) = 0. So either way, u = 0 corresponds to a = 0 or a = 2.

Similarly, when u = 1, maximum value of u occurs when a = 1, giving u = 1*(2 -1) = 1.

So, u ∈ [0,1]. Similarly, v, w ∈ [0,1].

So, for a, we have a = 1 ± √(1 - u). Let me check:

If a = 1 + √(1 - u):

When u = 0, a = 1 + 1 = 2, which works.

When u =1, a =1 + 0=1, which is fine.

Similarly, a =1 - √(1 - u):

When u=0, a=1 -1=0, which is also fine.

But since a is positive, for u near 1, a =1 - √(1 - u) ≈1 - (sqrt(2t) where t=1 -u≈0) ≈1 - sqrt(t), which is still positive.

But without knowing which branch to take, it's tricky. Maybe it's better to leave a, b, c in terms of u, v, w as above.

Alternatively, let me express S1, S2, S3 in terms of u, v, w.

Given that u = a(2 - a), so a =1 ± √(1 - u).

Similarly, b =1 ± √(1 - v),

and c =1 ± √(1 - w).

But this might not lead anywhere directly.

Alternatively, maybe I can consider that S1 = a + b - ab.

Expressed in terms of u and v:

Since u = a(2 - a), v = b(2 - b),

But S1 = a + b - ab.

Hmm, not straightforward.

Wait, let's see:

We have u = a(2 - a) = 2a - a²,

v = 2b - b²,

w = 2c - c².

So, from u = 2a - a², we can solve for a:

a² - 2a + u = 0 ⇒ a = [2 ± √(4 - 4u)] / 2 = 1 ± √(1 - u)

Similarly for b and c.

So, a =1 ± √(1 - u), but as a is positive and ≤2, both options are possible.

But without knowing which sign to choose, it's difficult.

Wait, perhaps making an assumption based on the equations.

Looking at equation 1:

S1 + R1 = 1/2

But S1 = a + b - ab, and R1 = √(uv).

Similarly, S2 + R2 =1, and S3 + R3 =3/2.

Since R1, R2, R3 are square roots, they are non-negative, so S1 ≤1/2, S2 ≤1, S3 ≤3/2.

But S1 = a + b - ab.

Given that a and b are between 0 and 2.

What's the maximum of S1? Let's see, for a,b ∈ [0,2], S1 = a + b - ab.

The maximum occurs when derivative is zero, but maybe more simply:

If a increases, the term a(1 - b) increases, but if b is also increasing, it's a trade-off.

Wait, actually, the function f(a, b) = a + b - ab is linear in a and b, with coefficients 1 - b and 1 - a respectively.

So, the maximum occurs at the corners of the domain.

So, when a=0, f= b

when a=2, f=2 + b - 2b = 2 - b

Similarly, when b=0, f=a

when b=2, f= a + 2 - 2a = 2 - a

So, the maximum of f(a,b) is 2, achieved when either a=2, b=0 or a=0, b=2.

But in our case, S1 is part of equation 1: S1 + R1 =1/2. Since R1 is non-negative, S1 ≤1/2.

So, S1 is at most 1/2.

Similarly, S2 ≤1, and S3 ≤3/2.

So, the values of a and b are such that S1 is ≤1/2.

Let me try plugging in some trial values for a and b.

Wait, perhaps taking a guess that a, b, c are fractions.

Alternatively, perhaps using substitution.

Wait, another idea: Let me denote p = √(uv), q = √(vw), r = √(wu).

Then, our equations become:

1. S1 + p =1/2

2. S2 + q =1

3. S3 + r =3/2

And we also have:

p^2 = uv,

q^2 = vw,

r^2 = wu.

So, from p^2 = uv and q^2 = vw, dividing these gives (p/q)^2 = u/w.

Similarly, from q^2 = vw and r^2 = wu, dividing gives (q/r)^2 = v/u.

And from p^2 = uv and r^2 = wu, dividing gives (p/r)^2 = v/w.

Hmm, this seems a bit abstract.

Alternatively, let me multiply all three equations:

(S1 + p)(S2 + q)(S3 + r) = (1/2)(1)(3/2) = 3/4.

But expanding this would be complicated.

Wait, perhaps considering that p, q, r are related via p^2 = uv, q^2 = vw, r^2 = wu.

So, multiplying p^2 * q^2 * r^2 = (uvw)^2.

So, (pqr)^2 = (uvw)^2 ⇒ pqr = uvw or pqr = -uvw, but since p, q, r are square roots, they are non-negative, so pqr = uvw.

But since u, v, w are non-negative, pqr = uvw.

But I don't know if that helps.

Alternatively, maybe taking logarithms? Probably overcomplicating.

Wait, perhaps instead of working with u, v, w, I should go back to the original variables.

Wait, going back to the original system:

1. √[x(2 - y)] + √[y(2 - x)] =1

2. √[y(2 - z)] + √[z(2 - y)] =√2

3. √[z(2 - x)] + √[x(2 - z)] =√3

Wait, these look similar to the equations for a triangle with sides 1, √2, √3?

Wait, 1² + (√2)² =1 +2=3=(√3)^2. So, maybe Pythagorean theorem involved?

Alternatively, maybe considering these as vector magnitudes or something else.

Wait, another idea: Let me denote A = √[x(2 - y)], B = √[y(2 - x)], C = √[y(2 - z)], D = √[z(2 - y)], E = √[z(2 - x)], F = √[x(2 - z)].

Then, equations become:

A + B =1,

C + D =√2,

E + F =√3.

Additionally, notice that:

A = √[x(2 - y)] ⇒ A² =x(2 - y),

B = √[y(2 - x)] ⇒ B² = y(2 - x),

C = √[y(2 - z)] ⇒ C² = y(2 - z),

D = √[z(2 - y)] ⇒ D² = z(2 - y),

E = √[z(2 - x)] ⇒ E² = z(2 - x),

F = √[x(2 - z)] ⇒ F² =x(2 - z).

So, we have six equations:

1. A + B =1

2. C + D =√2

3. E + F =√3

4. A² =x(2 - y)

5. B² = y(2 - x)

6. C² = y(2 - z)

7. D² = z(2 - y)

8. E² = z(2 - x)

9. F² =x(2 - z)

So, that's nine equations with nine variables: x, y, z, A, B, C, D, E, F.

But solving this system seems daunting. Maybe we can find relationships between variables.

Notice that from equations 4 and 5: A² =x(2 - y) and B² = y(2 - x).

Multiplying these: A²B² = xy(2 - y)(2 - x).

But (2 - y)(2 - x) =4 -2x -2y +xy.

Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, adding equations 4 and 5: A² + B² =x(2 - y) + y(2 - x)=2x -xy +2y -xy=2(x + y) -2xy.

Which is similar to equation 1: A + B=1.

Hmm, so A² + B² =2(x + y) -2xy.

But (A + B)² = A² + 2AB + B² =1²=1.

So, 1 = (A² + B²) + 2AB = [2(x + y) - 2xy] + 2AB.

Thus,

2(x + y) - 2xy + 2AB =1.

Divide by 2:

(x + y) - xy + AB =1/2.

Which is the same as equation S1 + R1=1/2 as before.

So, nothing new here.

Wait, maybe considering that A*B = √[x(2 - y)] * √[y(2 - x)] = √[xy(2 - x)(2 - y)].

Which is equal to √[xy(4 - 2x -2y +xy)].

Hmm, not particularly helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps considering that (A + B)^2 + (A - B)^2 = 2(A² + B²). Wait, but I already used that.

Wait, another idea: Suppose I let x = sin²α, y = sin²β, z = sin²γ. Since x, y, z are positive and ≤2, maybe this substitution will make sense.

But let me see: If x = sin²α, then 2 - x = 2 - sin²α = cos²α +1.

Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, hyperbolic functions? Maybe too complicated.

Alternatively, thinking about the equations, each pair of variables is connected through square roots.

Wait, maybe introducing variables for each square root term.

Let me define:

Let p = √[x(2 - y)], q = √[y(2 - x)], so p + q =1.

Similarly, r = √[y(2 - z)], s = √[z(2 - y)], so r + s =√2.

And t = √[z(2 - x)], u = √[x(2 - z)], so t + u =√3.

So, now, p + q =1, r + s =√2, t + u =√3.

Also, we have:

p² =x(2 - y),

q² = y(2 - x),

r² = y(2 - z),

s² = z(2 - y),

t² = z(2 - x),

u² =x(2 - z).

Hmm, so for example, p² =x(2 - y) and t² = z(2 - x). Maybe multiplying these gives p² t² =xz(2 - y)(2 - x).

Similarly, q² = y(2 - x) and u² =x(2 - z): q² u² = xy(2 - x)(2 - z).

Wait, perhaps looking for a ratio or something.

Alternatively, maybe express x, y, z in terms of p, q, etc.

From p² =x(2 - y) and q² = y(2 - x):

Let me solve for x and y.

From p² =x(2 - y) ⇒ x = p² / (2 - y).

From q² = y(2 - x) ⇒ y = q² / (2 - x).

Substitute x from the first equation into the second:

y = q² / (2 - p² / (2 - y)).

Multiply numerator and denominator by (2 - y):

y = q²(2 - y) / [2(2 - y) - p²]

Multiply both sides by denominator:

y[2(2 - y) - p²] = q²(2 - y)

Expand left side:

y[4 - 2y - p²] =2q² - q² y

Bring all terms to left:

y[4 - 2y - p²] + q² y -2q² =0

Factor y:

y[4 - 2y - p² + q²] -2q² =0

This is getting complicated. Maybe not the best path.

Alternatively, perhaps noticing that each equation resembles the sine addition formula? Because √a + √b kind of reminds me of sum formulas.

Wait, for instance, if we have something like sin(A + B) = sinA cosB + cosA sinB.

But that might not directly apply here.

Wait, another idea: Let me suppose that each pair (x, y), (y, z), (z, x) satisfies some trigonometric identity.

But perhaps overcomplicating again.

Wait, stepping back. Maybe I can assign numerical values to a, b, c.

Wait, earlier substitution gave us a, b, c each between 0 and 2.

Moreover, S1 + R1 =1/2, S2 + R2=1, S3 + R3=3/2.

So, S1 is quite small, up to 1/2, while S2 is up to1, and S3 up to 3/2.

Given that, maybe a, b, c are smaller numbers, perhaps fractions.

Wait, let me assume that a, b, c are each 1/2. Then:

S1 = a + b - ab =1/2 +1/2 - (1/2)(1/2)=1 -1/4=3/4>1/2. Which doesn't satisfy equation1.

So, a and b can't both be 1/2.

Alternatively, if a is larger and b smaller.

Wait, perhaps a=1, b=1/2.

Then S1=1 +1/2 -1*(1/2)=3/2 -1/2=1.

Which is greater than1/2.

Still too big.

Wait, maybe a=0. Let’s try a=0, then S1=0 + b -0= b.

So equation1: b + R1=1/2.

But R1=√[ab(2 - a)(2 - b)]=√[0*b*(2 -0)*(2 - b)]=0.

Hence, b=1/2.

So, if a=0, then b=1/2.

Similarly, check equation2: √[y(2 - z)] + √[z(2 - y)] =√2.

With y =2 - b=2 -1/2=3/2.

So equation2: √[3/2*(2 - z)] + √[z*(2 - 3/2)] =√2.

Simplify:

√[(3/2)(2 - z)] + √[z*(1/2)] =√2.

Let’s denote z as variable.

Let’s write this as:

√[(3/2)(2 - z)] + √(z/2) =√2.

Let me set t = √(z/2). Then z=2t².

So, 2 - z=2 -2t²=2(1 -t²).

Thus, the first term becomes √[(3/2)*2(1 - t²)] =√[3(1 - t²)].

The equation becomes:

√[3(1 - t²)] + t =√2.

Let me square both sides:

[√(3(1 - t²)) + t]^2 =2.

Expanding:

3(1 - t²) + 2t√(3(1 - t²)) + t² =2

Simplify:

3 -3t² +2t√(3(1 - t²)) + t²=2

Combine like terms:

3 -2t² +2t√(3(1 - t²))=2

Subtract 2:

1 -2t² +2t√(3(1 - t²))=0

Rearrange:

2t√(3(1 - t²)) =2t² -1

Square both sides:

4t² *3(1 - t²)=(2t² -1)^2

Simplify left side:

12t² -12t⁴

Right side:

4t⁴ -4t² +1

Set equation:

12t² -12t⁴=4t⁴ -4t² +1

Bring all terms to left:

12t² -12t⁴ -4t⁴ +4t² -1=0

Combine like terms:

(12t² +4t²) + (-12t⁴ -4t⁴) -1=0 ⇒16t² -16t⁴ -1=0

Rewrite:

16t⁴ -16t² +1=0

Let me set u=t²:

16u² -16u +1=0

Quadratic in u:

u=(16±√(256 -64))/32=(16±√192)/32=(16±8√3)/32=(2±√3)/4

Since u=t²≥0, both solutions are valid as 2+√3≈3.732>0, 2−√3≈0.267>0.

Thus, t²=(2±√3)/4.

So, t=√[(2±√3)/4]=√(2±√3)/2.

But t was defined as √(z/2), so t≥0.

So, z=2t²=2*(2±√3)/4=(2±√3)/2.

Thus, z=(2±√3)/2.

But z must be ≤2, since z≤2. Both solutions are valid since (2+√3)/2≈(2+1.732)/2≈1.866<2, and (2−√3)/2≈(2−1.732)/2≈0.134<2.

So, z=(2±√3)/2.

Now, let's recall that in equation1, a=0, b=1/2.

So, moving to equation3: √[z(2 - x)] + √[x(2 - z)] =√3.

But x=2 -a=2 -0=2.

Wait, hold on: Earlier substitution was a=2 -x. So, if a=0, then x=2.

Yes, correct.

So, x=2, y=2 -b=2 -1/2=3/2, z=(2±√3)/2.

So, plug into equation3:

√[z(2 - x)] + √[x(2 - z)] =√[z(0)] + √[2(2 - z)] =0 + √[2(2 - z)] =√[4 - 2z].

Set equal to√3:

√(4 - 2z)=√3 ⇒4 -2z=3 ⇒2z=1 ⇒z=1/2.

But earlier, we had z=(2±√3)/2≈1.866 or≈0.134. But here, z=1/2=0.5.

But according to our earlier solution, z=(2±√3)/2. But 1/2 is neither (2+√3)/2 nor (2−√3)/2.

Wait, contradiction. So, my assumption that a=0 led to z=1/2, which isn't consistent with previous z=(2±√3)/2.

Hmm, so that suggests that a cannot be zero. Or maybe somewhere along the line, I made a wrong assumption.

Wait, in the process, when I set a=0, which led to b=1/2, then tried to solve for z, got z=1/2, conflicting with the earlier result.

Therefore, perhaps a cannot be zero. So, maybe my initial assumption that a=0 was wrong. Therefore, perhaps a≠0.

Hence, maybe I should not assume a=0.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider another substitution.

Wait, let me think differently.

Earlier, I noticed that when I squared the equations, I ended up with expressions involving a(2 - a), b(2 - b), etc., which resemble quadratic expressions. Maybe it's helpful to express these as:

Let’s define p = √[a(2 - a)], q = √[b(2 - b)], r = √[c(2 - c)}.

Then, note that:

From equation1: S1 + p =1/2, where S1 =a + b - ab.

Similarly, equation2:S2 + q=1, S2=b + c - bc.

Equation3:S3 + r=3/2, S3=a + c - ac.

Also, note that p² = a(2 - a), so p = √[a(2 - a)}.

Similarly for q and r.

So, perhaps p, q, r are related to a, b, c.

Moreover, since p² = a(2 - a) ⇒ p² =2a -a².

Similarly, q²=2b -b², r²=2c -c².

So, maybe I can express a, b, c in terms of p, q, r.

From p²=2a -a² ⇒a² -2a + p²=0 ⇒a=(2 ±√(4 -4p²))/2=1 ±√(1 -p²).

Similarly, b=1 ±√(1 -q²), c=1 ±√(1 -r²}.

Again, same issue as before.

But maybe we can write S1 =a + b -ab in terms of p, q.

Given that a=1 ±√(1 -p²}, b=1 ±√(1 -q²}.

But seems messy.

Wait, perhaps instead of dealing with a, b, c, work with p, q, r.

Given that:

S1 + p=1/2,

S2 + q=1,

S3 + r=3/2,

where S1 =a + b - ab,

S2 =b + c - bc,

S3 =a + c - ac,

and p =√[a(2 - a)], q =√[b(2 - b)], r =√[c(2 - c)}.

But still, I don't see a direct relationship.

Wait, another idea: Since S1 =a + b -ab, can we express this in terms of p and q?

Because p² =2a -a², q²=2b -b².

So, let me compute S1:

S1 =a + b -ab.

Multiply numerator and denominator by something?

Wait, another approach: Let me compute S1 + p=1/2.

But p=√[2a -a²}.

So, 1/2 = S1 + p= a + b -ab +√(2a -a²).

Similarly, for other equations.

This seems complicated, but perhaps we can attempt to solve numerically.

Alternatively, perhaps assuming specific relationships between a, b, c.

Wait, another angle: Consider that the system is cyclic. Each equation relates two variables and the third appears in the next equation.

Wait, perhaps defining t = a + b + c.

But not sure.

Wait, perhaps adding all three equations:

S1 + S2 + S3 + p + q + r=1/2 +1 +3/2= 3.

But S1 + S2 + S3= (a + b -ab)+(b + c - bc)+(a + c -ac)=2a + 2b + 2c -ab - bc -ac.

So, 2(a + b + c) - (ab + bc + ac) + p + q + r=3.

But not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps noting that in each equation, the sum of two variables minus their product plus the square root equals a constant.

Wait, another thought: Let me consider that for each pair (a, b), the term a + b -ab is similar to 1 - (1 -a)(1 - b). Because:

1 - (1 -a)(1 - b)=1 - [1 -a -b +ab]=a + b -ab.

So, S1 =1 - (1 -a)(1 - b).

Similarly, S2=1 - (1 -b)(1 -c),

S3=1 - (1 -a)(1 -c).

So, substituting back into the equations:

1 - (1 -a)(1 - b) + √[a(2 - a)}=1/2,

1 - (1 -b)(1 -c) + √[b(2 - b)}=1,

1 - (1 -a)(1 -c) + √[c(2 - c)}=3/2.

Therefore, rearranged:

(1 -a)(1 - b) =1 - (1/2) -√[a(2 - a)}=1/2 -√[a(2 - a)}.

Similarly:

(1 -b)(1 -c)=1 -1 -√[b(2 - b)}= -√[b(2 - b)}.

And:

(1 -a)(1 -c)=1 - 3/2 -√[c(2 - c)}= -1/2 -√[c(2 - c)}.

So, now we have:

1. (1 -a)(1 - b)=1/2 -√[a(2 - a)}.

2. (1 -b)(1 -c)= -√[b(2 - b)}.

3. (1 -a)(1 -c)= -1/2 -√[c(2 - c)}.

Hmm, equation2 seems problematic because LHS is (1 -b)(1 -c), which is non-negative as b, c ≤2, so (1 -b) ≥-1, (1 -c)≥-1, but since b,c ≤2, they can be as low as negative infinity? Wait, no, b, c are positive, so 1 -b can be negative or positive.

Wait, but (1 -b)(1 -c) is equal to negative square root, which is non-positive.

So, equation2: (1 -b)(1 -c)= -√[b(2 - b)}.

But RHS is non-positive, so LHS must be ≤0.

So, (1 -b)(1 -c) ≤0.

Which implies either 1 -b ≤0 and 1 -c ≥0, or vice versa.

Case1: 1 -b ≤0 and 1 -c ≥0 ⇒ b ≥1 and c ≤1.

Case2:1 -b ≥0 and 1 -c ≤0⇒b ≤1 and c ≥1.

So, either b ≥1 and c ≤1, or b ≤1 and c ≥1.

Similarly, equation1: (1 -a)(1 -b)=1/2 -√[a(2 - a)}.

Here, RHS is 1/2 - something. Since √[a(2 - a)} is non-negative, RHS ≤1/2.

But LHS is (1 -a)(1 -b). Depending on a and b, this can be positive or negative.

If (1 -a)(1 -b) ≤1/2.

But equation1 is set to equal something ≤1/2.

Similarly, equation3: (1 -a)(1 -c)= -1/2 -√[c(2 - c)}.

So, RHS is -1/2 - something, hence ≤-1/2.

So, LHS is (1 -a)(1 -c) ≤-1/2.

Which requires that (1 -a)(1 -c) ≤-1/2.

Thus, either 1 -a ≥0 and 1 -c ≤-1/2, or 1 -a ≤0 and 1 -c ≥ something.

Wait, (1 -a)(1 -c) ≤-1/2.

Possible cases:

Either (1 -a) >0 and (1 -c) ≤-1/2, leading to (1 -a)(1 -c) ≤- (1 -a)/2.

Or (1 -a) <0 and (1 -c) ≥ something.

Wait, let me think.

If (1 -a)(1 -c) ≤-1/2,

then either:

1. (1 -a) >0 and (1 -c) ≤-1/2, which implies c ≥3/2.

Or,

2. (1 -a) <0 and (1 -c) ≥ (something). Specifically,

(1 -a)(1 -c) ≤-1/2.

Let me rearrange:

(1 -a)(1 -c) ≤-1/2.

Assuming (1 -a) ≠0, divide both sides by (1 -a):

If (1 -a) >0, then (1 -c) ≤-1/(2(1 -a)).

If (1 -a) <0, then (1 -c) ≥ -1/(2(1 -a)), since inequality reverses when dividing by negative.

So, two subcases.

But this is getting very convoluted. Maybe I should try assuming specific values for a, b, c.

Wait, another thought: Maybe let’s denote u=1 -a, v=1 -b, w=1 -c.

Then, the equations become:

1. uv =1/2 -√[a(2 - a)}.

2. vw= -√[b(2 - b)}.

3. uw= -1/2 -√[c(2 - c)}.

But a=1 -u, b=1 -v, c=1 -w.

So, let me substitute:

1. uv=1/2 -√[(1 -u)(1 - (1 -u))}=1/2 -√[(1 -u)u].

2. vw= -√[(1 -v)(2 - (1 -v))}= -√[(1 -v)(1 +v)}= -√(1 -v²).

Similarly, equation3:

uw= -1/2 -√[(1 -w)(2 - (1 -w))}= -1/2 -√[(1 -w)(1 +w)}= -1/2 -√(1 -w²).

So now, equations become:

1. uv =1/2 -√(u(1 -u)}.

2. vw= -√(1 -v²).

3. uw= -1/2 -√(1 -w²).

So, these are three equations in variables u, v, w.

This seems slightly better, but still complicated.

Let me analyze equation2 first:

vw= -√(1 -v²).

Let me solve for w:

w= -√(1 -v²)/v.

But since w=1 -c, and c is positive, w=1 -c can be anything depending on c.

But from equation2: w= -√(1 -v²)/v.

Note that v=1 -b, and b>0, so v<1.

Also, √(1 -v²) is real only if 1 -v²≥0 ⇒v²≤1, which holds as v<1.

Thus, w is negative, since RHS is negative.

Therefore, w <0.

So, w=1 -c <0 ⇒c >1.

So, c >1.

From equation3:

uw= -1/2 -√(1 -w²}.

But u=1 -a, which can be positive or negative.

Given that, and w <0, let's see.

But equation3 is:

u * w = -1/2 -√(1 -w²}.

But since w <0, u *w is negative if u >0, positive if u <0.

But RHS is always negative, as -1/2 - something.

Therefore, u *w must be negative.

Thus, u and w must have opposite signs.

Since w <0, u must be positive.

Therefore, u >0 ⇒1 -a >0 ⇒a <1.

So, a <1.

Similarly, from equation1:

uv=1/2 -√(u(1 -u)}.

But u >0.

So, uv=1/2 -√(u -u²}.

Let me denote t=√(u -u²}=√[u(1 -u)}.

Then, equation1: u v=1/2 -t.

But from equation2: v= -√(1 -v²}/w.

Wait, maybe not helpful.

Wait, equation2: w= -√(1 -v²)/v.

So, plug into equation3:

u*(-√(1 -v²)/v)= -1/2 -√(1 -w²}.

But w= -√(1 -v²)/v.

Compute √(1 -w²}:

√(1 -w²}=√[1 - (1 -v²)/v²}=√[(v² - (1 -v²))/v²}=√[(2v² -1)/v²}=√(2v² -1)/|v|.

But since v=1 -b, and b is positive, v can be positive or negative.

But from equation2, w= -√(1 -v²)/v.

Given that w <0, and v=1 -b.

If v >0, then w= -positive/positive= negative.

If v <0, then w= -positive/negative= positive. But earlier, we saw that w <0, so v must be positive.

Thus, v >0.

Therefore, |v|=v.

Thus, √(1 -w²}=√(2v² -1)/v.

Therefore, equation3 becomes:

u*(-√(1 -v²)/v)= -1/2 -√(2v² -1)/v.

Multiply both sides by v:

u*(-√(1 -v²))= -v/2 -√(2v² -1).

Multiply both sides by -1:

u√(1 -v²)= v/2 +√(2v² -1).

So, equation1 is:

u*v=1/2 -√(u -u²}.

Equation3 transformed is:

u√(1 -v²}=v/2 +√(2v² -1}.

This is getting really involved. Maybe I can try to solve for u from equation1 and plug into equation3.

From equation1:

u= [1/2 -√(u -u²}]/v.

Plug this into equation3:

([1/2 -√(u -u²}]/v)*√(1 -v²}=v/2 +√(2v² -1}.

This seems too tangled. Perhaps numerical methods are needed, but given that this is a competition problem, there must be a clever substitution or symmetry.

Wait, stepping back, I recall that sometimes in systems with multiple square roots, assuming proportional relations between variables can help. Maybe a : b : c correspond to some ratio.

Alternatively, considering that each equation involves two variables and the square roots, maybe they can be represented as angles in a triangle or something.

Wait, let me think about the structure of the equations.

Looking back, the original equations were:

1. √(2x - xy) + √(2y - xy)=1

2. √(2y - yz) + √(2z - yz)=√2

3. √(2z - zx) + √(2x - zx)=√3

Let me factor:

1. √[x(2 - y)] + √[y(2 - x)] =1

2. √[y(2 - z)] + √[z(2 - y)] =√2

3. √[z(2 - x)] + √[x(2 - z)] =√3

Now, if I think of x, y, z as variables such that each term is of the form √[variable*(2 - variable)].

Wait, another idea: Let me set x = sin α, y = sin β, z = sin γ, for some angles α, β, γ in [0, π/2], since sin is increasing there and sin π/2=1, which is within our variables' range (x,y,z ≤2, but sin is limited to 1). Hmm, maybe not the best.

Alternatively, set x=2 sin²θ, y=2 sin²φ, z=2 sin²ψ, so that 2 - x=2 cos²θ, etc.

So, let me try this substitution:

Let x=2 sin²θ,

y=2 sin²φ,

z=2 sin²ψ.

Then, 2 -x=2 cos²θ,

2 -y=2 cos²φ,

2 -z=2 cos²ψ.

Thus, √[x(2 - y)] =√[2 sin²θ *2 cos²φ}=√[4 sin²θ cos²φ}=2 sinθ cosφ.

Similarly,

√[y(2 - x)}=2 sinφ cosθ,

√[y(2 - z)}=2 sinφ cosψ,

√[z(2 - y)}=2 sinψ cosφ,

√[z(2 - x)}=2 sinψ cosθ,

√[x(2 - z)}=2 sinθ cosψ.

Therefore, the original equations become:

1. 2 sinθ cosφ +2 sinφ cosθ=1.

Simplify: 2(sinθ cosφ + sinφ cosθ)=1 ⇒2 sin(θ + φ)=1 ⇒sin(θ + φ)=1/2.

Similarly, equation2:

√[y(2 - z)} +√[z(2 - y)}=√2.

Which is 2 sinφ cosψ +2 sinψ cosφ=√2.

Simplify:2(sinφ cosψ + sinψ cosφ)=√2 ⇒2 sin(φ + ψ)=√2 ⇒sin(φ + ψ)=√2 /2=1/√2.

Equation3:

√[z(2 - x)} +√[x(2 - z)}=√3.

Which is 2 sinψ cosθ +2 sinθ cosψ=√3.

Simplify:2(sinψ cosθ + sinθ cosψ)=√3 ⇒2 sin(ψ + θ)=√3 ⇒sin(ψ + θ)=√3 /2.

Wow, okay, so the system reduces to:

1. sin(θ + φ)=1/2.

2. sin(φ + ψ)=1/√2.

3. sin(ψ + θ)=√3 /2.

So, this is much simpler!

Now, let me denote:

Let A=θ + φ,

B=φ + ψ,

C=ψ + θ.

Then, we have:

1. sin A=1/2,

2. sin B=1/√2,

3. sin C=√3 /2.

Additionally, note that:

A + B + C=2(θ + φ + ψ).

But let me think about A, B, C.

Also, note that:

A=θ + φ,

B=φ + ψ,

C=θ + ψ.

So, adding A + B + C=2θ +2φ +2ψ=2(θ + φ + ψ).

So, θ + φ + ψ=(A + B + C)/2.

But maybe more importantly, we can express individual angles.

For example, from A=θ + φ, B=φ + ψ, subtracting A - B=θ - ψ.

Similarly, other combinations.

But maybe it's better to solve for θ, φ, ψ.

From the given sine equations:

sin A=1/2 ⇒A=π/6 or 5π/6.

sin B=1/√2 ⇒B=π/4 or 3π/4.

sin C=√3 /2 ⇒C=π/3 or 2π/3.

So, we have possibilities for A, B, C.

Our goal is to find θ, φ, ψ such that:

A=θ + φ=π/6 or 5π/6,

B=φ + ψ=π/4 or 3π/4,

C=θ + ψ=π/3 or 2π/3.

We need to find θ, φ, ψ in [0, π/2] such that their pairwise sums are as above.

Let me consider the possible combinations.

First, let's pick A=π/6.

Then, A=θ + φ=π/6.

From B=φ + ψ=π/4 or 3π/4.

From C=θ + ψ=π/3 or 2π/3.

Let me attempt to solve for θ, φ, ψ with A=π/6.

Case1: A=π/6, B=π/4, C=π/3.

So,

θ + φ=π/6,

φ + ψ=π/4,

θ + ψ=π/3.

Let me solve this system.

From first equation: θ=π/6 - φ.

From second equation: ψ=π/4 - φ.

From third equation: θ + ψ=π/3.

Substitute θ and ψ:

(π/6 - φ) + (π/4 - φ)=π/3.

Simplify:

π/6 + π/4 - 2φ=π/3.

Compute π/6 + π/4= (2π + 3π)/12=5π/12.

Thus,

5π/12 -2φ=π/3.

π/3=4π/12,

So,

5π/12 -4π/12=2φ ⇒π/12=2φ ⇒φ=π/24.

Then,

θ=π/6 - π/24= (4π -π)/24=3π/24=π/8.

ψ=π/4 - π/24= (6π -π)/24=5π/24.

Check if θ, φ, ψ are in [0, π/2]:

π/8≈0.3927 rad,

π/24≈0.1309 rad,

5π/24≈0.6545 rad.

All are within [0, π/2≈1.5708]. Good.

Thus, this is a valid solution.

Case2: A=π/6, B=π/4, C=2π/3.

So,

θ + φ=π/6,

φ + ψ=π/4,

θ + ψ=2π/3.

From first equation: θ=π/6 - φ.

From second equation: ψ=π/4 - φ.

From third equation: θ + ψ=2π/3.

Substitute:

(π/6 - φ) + (π/4 - φ)=2π/3.

Compute:

π/6 + π/4 -2φ=2π/3.

Convert to twelfths:

2π/12 +3π/12=5π/12.

Thus,

5π/12 -2φ=8π/12.

Thus,

-2φ=3π/12=π/4 ⇒φ=-π/8.

Negative angle, invalid. Discard.

Case3: A=π/6, B=3π/4, C=π/3.

So,

θ + φ=π/6,

φ + ψ=3π/4,

θ + ψ=π/3.

From first equation: θ=π/6 - φ.

From second equation: ψ=3π/4 - φ.

From third equation: θ + ψ=π/3.

Substitute:

(π/6 - φ) + (3π/4 - φ)=π/3.

Simplify:

π/6 +3π/4 -2φ=π/3.

Compute π/6 +3π/4= (2π +9π)/12=11π/12.

Thus,

11π/12 -2φ=4π/12=π/3.

Thus,

11π/12 -π/3=2φ ⇒11π/12 -4π/12=7π/12=2φ ⇒φ=7π/24≈0.9163 rad.

Then,

θ=π/6 -7π/24= (4π -7π)/24= -3π/24= -π/8. Negative angle. Invalid.

Case4:A=π/6, B=3π/4, C=2π/3.

So,

θ + φ=π/6,

φ + ψ=3π/4,

θ + ψ=2π/3.

From first equation: θ=π/6 -φ.

From second equation: ψ=3π/4 -φ.

From third equation: θ + ψ=2π/3.

Substitute:

(π/6 -φ) + (3π/4 -φ)=2π/3.

Simplify:

π/6 +3π/4 -2φ=2π/3.

Compute π/6 +3π/4= (2π +9π)/12=11π/12.

Thus,

11π/12 -2φ=8π/12=2π/3.

So,

11π/12 -2π/3=2φ.

Convert 2π/3=8π/12.

Thus,

11π/12 -8π/12=3π/12=π/4=2φ ⇒φ=π/8≈0.3927 rad.

Then,

θ=π/6 -π/8= (4π -3π)/24=π/24≈0.1309 rad.

ψ=3π/4 -π/8= (6π -π)/8=5π/8≈1.9635 rad.

But ψ=5π/8≈1.9635 rad≈112.5 degrees, which is greater than π/2≈1.5708 rad≈90 degrees. So, ψ>π/2, which contradicts our earlier substitution where ψ=sin^{-1}(something). Since ψ was expressed as 2 sin²ψ=x, and x must be positive, but ψ being greater than π/2 would imply sinψ decreasing, but 2 sin²ψ would still be fine. However, we must ensure that all substitutions hold.

Wait, but in the substitution, we set x=2 sin²θ, so θ can be up to π/2, but ψ=5π/8 is beyond that. So, this is invalid, since θ, φ, ψ must be in [0, π/2].

Thus, Case4 invalid.

So, only Case1 is valid, with A=π/6, B=π/4, C=π/3, resulting in θ=π/8, φ=π/24, ψ=5π/24.

Therefore, we can find x, y, z:

x=2 sin²θ=2 sin²(π/8),

y=2 sin²φ=2 sin²(π/24),

z=2 sin²ψ=2 sin²(5π/24).

So, now, we need to compute (1 -x)(1 -y)(1 -z).

First, let's compute each term:

1 -x=1 -2 sin²(π/8)=cos(π/4)=√2/2≈0.7071.

Similarly,

1 -y=1 -2 sin²(π/24)=cos(π/12)= (√6 +√2)/4≈0.9659.

1 -z=1 -2 sin²(5π/24).

Wait, 5π/24 is 37.5 degrees.

Recall that 2 sin²θ=1 -cos2θ, so 2 sin²(5π/24)=1 -cos(5π/12).

Thus, 1 -z=1 - [1 -cos(5π/12)]=cos(5π/12).

5π/12=75 degrees, so cos(5π/12)= (√6 -√2)/4≈0.2588.

Wait, let me confirm:

cos(5π/12)=cos75°= (√6 -√2)/4≈0.2588.

Yes, correct.

Therefore,

(1 -x)=√2/2,

(1 -y)=cos(π/12)= (√6 +√2)/4,

(1 -z)=cos(5π/12)= (√6 -√2)/4.

Thus,

(1 -x)(1 -y)(1 -z)= [√2/2] * [(√6 +√2)/4] * [(√6 -√2)/4].

Compute this:

First, compute [(√6 +√2)/4] * [(√6 -√2)/4].

This is of the form (a + b)(a - b)=a² - b², where a=√6, b=√2.

Thus,

(√6 +√2)(√6 -√2)=6 -2=4.

Therefore,

[(√6 +√2)/4] * [(√6 -√2)/4]=4/(4*4)=4/16=1/4.

Thus,

(1 -x)(1 -y)(1 -z)= [√2/2] * [1/4] =√2 /8.

Therefore, [(1 -x)(1 -y)(1 -z)]²= (√2 /8)²= (2)/(64)=1/32.

Thus, m=1, n=32, m +n=33.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{33}

Given the system of equations involving positive real numbers \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\):

1. \(\sqrt{2x - xy} + \sqrt{2y - xy} = 1\)
2. \(\sqrt{2y - yz} + \sqrt{2z - yz} = \sqrt{2}\)
3. \(\sqrt{2z - zx} + \sqrt{2x - zx} = \sqrt{3}\)

We start by factoring each term under the square roots:

1. \(\sqrt{x(2 - y)} + \sqrt{y(2 - x)} = 1\)
2. \(\sqrt{y(2 - z)} + \sqrt{z(2 - y)} = \sqrt{2}\)
3. \(\sqrt{z(2 - x)} + \sqrt{x(2 - z)} = \sqrt{3}\)

We introduce substitutions \(a = x\), \(b = y\), \(c = z\) and recognize the structure of the equations. We then use trigonometric substitutions to simplify the problem. By setting \(x = 2 \sin^2 \theta\), \(y = 2 \sin^2 \phi\), and \(z = 2 \sin^2 \psi\), we transform the equations into trigonometric identities:

1. \(\sin(\theta + \phi) = \frac{1}{2}\)
2. \(\sin(\phi + \psi) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\)
3. \(\sin(\psi + \theta) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\)

Solving these trigonometric equations, we find the angles \(\theta\), \(\phi\), and \(\psi\) and subsequently determine \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\). Using these values, we compute \((1 - x)(1 - y)(1 - z)\):

- \(1 - x = \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\)
- \(1 - y = \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{12}\right) = \frac{\sqrt{6} + \sqrt{2}}{4}\)
- \(1 - z = \cos\left(\frac{5\pi}{12}\right) = \frac{\sqrt{6} - \sqrt{2}}{4}\)

Multiplying these results:

\[
(1 - x)(1 - y)(1 - z) = \left(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right) \left(\frac{\sqrt{6} + \sqrt{2}}{4}\right) \left(\frac{\sqrt{6} - \sqrt{2}}{4}\right)
\]

Simplifying, we find:

\[
(1 - x)(1 - y)(1 - z) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{8}
\]

Squaring this result:

\[
[(1 - x)(1 - y)(1 - z)]^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{2}{64} = \frac{1}{32}
\]

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{33}
\]
