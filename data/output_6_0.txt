 The problem: 
Let $x,$ $y,$ and $z$ be positive real numbers satisfying the system of equations:
\begin{align*} \sqrt{2x-xy} + \sqrt{2y-xy} &= 1 \\ \sqrt{2y-yz} + \sqrt{2z-yz} &= \sqrt2 \\ \sqrt{2z-zx} + \sqrt{2x-zx} &= \sqrt3. \end{align*} 
Then $\left[ (1-x)(1-y)(1-z) \right]^2$ can be written as $\frac{m}{n},$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n.$


Alright, so I've got this system of equations with three variables x, y, z. They all seem to have a similar structure, each involving square roots and some combination of two variables. My goal is to find [(1 - x)(1 - y)(1 - z)]² and express it as a fraction m/n, then find m + n.

First, let me write down the equations again to get a clear picture:

1. √(2x - xy) + √(2y - xy) = 1
2. √(2y - yz) + √(2z - yz) = √2
3. √(2z - zx) + √(2x - zx) = √3

Hmm, each equation involves two variables under square roots that subtract their product from twice themselves. It seems symmetric in a way, but not entirely because the right-hand sides are different constants (1, √2, √3). Maybe there's a pattern or substitution that can simplify this.

Looking at the first equation: √(2x - xy) + √(2y - xy) = 1

I notice that both terms inside the square roots have a common factor of (something minus xy). Let me try to factor that:

√[x(2 - y)] + √[y(2 - x)] = 1

Similarly, for the second equation:

√[y(2 - z)] + √[z(2 - y)] = √2

And the third equation:

√[z(2 - x)] + √[x(2 - z)] = √3

Ah, now it looks more symmetric. So each equation is of the form √[a(2 - b)] + √[b(2 - a)] = c, where a and b are variables, and c is a constant. This might hint towards some substitution or relationship between a and b.

Maybe if I let u = 2 - x, v = 2 - y, w = 2 - z? Or perhaps another substitution. Wait, let's see.

Alternatively, perhaps set a = √[x(2 - y)] and b = √[y(2 - x)] for the first equation, so that a + b = 1. Then, squaring both sides might help.

Let me try that for the first equation:

(√[x(2 - y)] + √[y(2 - x)])² = 1²
Which gives:
x(2 - y) + y(2 - x) + 2√[x(2 - y)y(2 - x)] = 1

Simplify the left side:

First, expand x(2 - y) + y(2 - x):
= 2x - xy + 2y - xy
= 2x + 2y - 2xy

So we have:
2x + 2y - 2xy + 2√[xy(2 - x)(2 - y)] = 1

Hmm, maybe factor out a 2:

2(x + y - xy) + 2√[xy(2 - x)(2 - y)] = 1

Divide both sides by 2:

x + y - xy + √[xy(2 - x)(2 - y)] = 1/2

That's still a bit complicated. Maybe I can denote S = x + y - xy and T = √[xy(2 - x)(2 - y)], so S + T = 1/2.

But without knowing more about S and T, it's hard to proceed. Maybe trying to do the same for the other equations?

Second equation:

√[y(2 - z)] + √[z(2 - y)] = √2

Square both sides:

y(2 - z) + z(2 - y) + 2√[yz(2 - z)(2 - y)] = 2

Simplify:

2y - yz + 2z - yz + 2√[yz(2 - z)(2 - y)] = 2
=> 2(y + z - yz) + 2√[yz(2 - y)(2 - z)] = 2

Divide by 2:

(y + z - yz) + √[yz(2 - y)(2 - z)] = 1

Again, similar structure as the first equation. Let me denote U = y + z - yz and V = √[yz(2 - y)(2 - z)], so U + V = 1.

Third equation:

√[z(2 - x)] + √[x(2 - z)] = √3

Square both sides:

z(2 - x) + x(2 - z) + 2√[zx(2 - x)(2 - z)] = 3

Simplify:

2z - zx + 2x - zx + 2√[zx(2 - x)(2 - z)] = 3
=> 2(z + x - zx) + 2√[zx(2 - x)(2 - z)] = 3

Divide by 2:

(z + x - zx) + √[zx(2 - x)(2 - z)] = 3/2

Denote W = z + x - zx and Q = √[zx(2 - x)(2 - z)], so W + Q = 3/2.

Now, looking back at the first equation after substitution: S + T = 1/2, second: U + V = 1, third: W + Q = 3/2.

It's not immediately clear how these relate. Maybe I can consider if all these expressions S, U, W are similar, but not sure.

Wait, let me think differently. Let's assume that in each equation, the expression inside the square roots is a perfect square or something manageable.

Alternatively, maybe introduce variables like a = √[x(2 - y)], b = √[y(2 - x)], so that a + b = 1 as per the first equation.

Similarly, for the second equation, let c = √[y(2 - z)], d = √[z(2 - y)], so c + d = √2.

For the third equation, e = √[z(2 - x)], f = √[x(2 - z)], so e + f = √3.

This might lead us to a system of equations with six variables (a, b, c, d, e, f), but probably too many variables.

Alternatively, maybe we can solve for one variable in terms of another.

From the first equation, since a + b = 1, we can write b = 1 - a.

But a² = x(2 - y) and b² = y(2 - x).

So, a² = x(2 - y)
and b² = y(2 - x)

Since b = 1 - a, we have (1 - a)² = y(2 - x)

So, expanding, 1 - 2a + a² = 2y - xy

But from a² = x(2 - y), which is 2x - xy.

Therefore, 1 - 2a + (2x - xy) = 2y - xy

Simplify:

1 - 2a + 2x - xy = 2y - xy

Cancel out -xy on both sides:

1 - 2a + 2x = 2y

So, 1 - 2a + 2x = 2y

Let me rearrange:

2y = 1 - 2a + 2x
Divide by 2:

y = (1 - 2a)/2 + x

Similarly, maybe express y in terms of x and a.

But also, from a² = x(2 - y):

We can plug y from above into this.

So, a² = x(2 - [(1 - 2a)/2 + x])

Simplify inside the brackets:

2 - (1 - 2a)/2 - x = [4 - (1 - 2a) - 2x]/2 = [4 - 1 + 2a - 2x]/2 = [3 + 2a - 2x]/2

Thus, a² = x * [3 + 2a - 2x]/2

Multiply both sides by 2:

2a² = x(3 + 2a - 2x)

Expand the RHS:

2a² = 3x + 2a x - 2x²

Bring everything to one side:

2x² - 2a x + 3x - 2a² = 0

Factor:

2x² + (-2a + 3)x - 2a² = 0

This is a quadratic in x. Let's write it as:

2x² + (3 - 2a)x - 2a² = 0

Perhaps we can solve for x using quadratic formula.

Discriminant D = (3 - 2a)^2 - 4*2*(-2a²) = 9 - 12a + 4a² + 16a² = 9 - 12a + 20a²

Thus,

x = [-(3 - 2a) ± √(9 - 12a + 20a²)] / (2*2) = [2a - 3 ± √(20a² - 12a + 9)] / 4

Since x must be positive, we need to choose the positive root.

But this seems complicated; maybe we can find a relation between a and another variable.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to look for symmetry or make substitutions that reduce the number of variables.

Looking back at the original equations, they involve cyclic permutations of x, y, z. So maybe assuming x = y = z? But plugging into first equation:

√(2x - x²) + √(2x - x²) = 1

So 2√(2x - x²) = 1 => √(2x - x²) = 1/2

Square both sides: 2x - x² = 1/4 => x² - 2x + 1/4 = 0

Solutions: x = [2 ± √(4 - 1)] / 2 = [2 ± √3]/2 ≈ (2 ± 1.732)/2, which would give x ≈ 1.866 or 0.134. Both positive.

But does this satisfy the other equations? Let's check second equation:

If x = y = z, then √(2y - y²) + √(2y - y²) = 2√(2y - y²) = √2

So 2√(2y - y²) = √2 => √(2y - y²) = √2 / 2 = 1/√2

Square: 2y - y² = 1/2 => y² - 2y + 1/2 = 0 => y = [2 ± √(4 - 2)] / 2 = [2 ± √2]/2 ≈ (2 ± 1.414)/2, so y ≈ 1.707 or 0.293

But wait, from first equation, x was either ~1.866 or ~0.134, but here y must match x, but 1.707 vs 0.293 don't align with 1.866 or 0.134. Therefore, x ≠ y ≠ z. So the assumption is wrong.

Hence, variables aren't equal. So maybe another approach.

Looking again at the first equation:

√[x(2 - y)] + √[y(2 - x)] = 1

Let me consider substituting u = √x, v = √y, but not sure. Alternatively, perhaps setting t = √x and s = √y, but not obvious.

Alternatively, maybe think of each term as something else.

Wait, what if I let a = √(x(2 - y)) and b = √(y(2 - x)). Then, a + b = 1.

Also, note that a² = x(2 - y) and b² = y(2 - x).

So, from a² = 2x - xy and b² = 2y - xy.

Subtracting these equations: a² - b² = 2x - xy - (2y - xy) = 2x - 2y

So, a² - b² = 2(x - y)

But a + b = 1, so a² - b² = (a - b)(a + b) = (a - b)(1) = a - b

Therefore, a - b = 2(x - y)

But a + b = 1 and a - b = 2(x - y). Maybe solving for a and b.

Adding equations: (a + b) + (a - b) = 1 + 2(x - y) => 2a = 1 + 2(x - y) => a = [1 + 2(x - y)] / 2

Subtracting: (a + b) - (a - b) = 1 - 2(x - y) => 2b = 1 - 2(x - y) => b = [1 - 2(x - y)] / 2

But since a and b are square roots, they must be non-negative. Also, since x and y are positive, 2 - y and 2 - x must be positive, so y < 2 and x < 2.

Given that, and given that a + b = 1, both a and b are less than 1.

But I'm not sure if this helps directly.

Alternatively, maybe express x and y in terms of a and b.

From a² = 2x - xy and b² = 2y - xy.

So, we can write a² = x(2 - y) and b² = y(2 - x).

Let me try to solve for x and y.

From a² = x(2 - y), we have x = a² / (2 - y)

From b² = y(2 - x), substitute x from above:

b² = y(2 - a² / (2 - y))

Simplify denominator:

= y[ (2(2 - y) - a²) / (2 - y) ) ]

= y[ (4 - 2y - a²) / (2 - y) ]

So,

b² = y(4 - 2y - a²) / (2 - y)

Multiply both sides by (2 - y):

b²(2 - y) = y(4 - 2y - a²)

Expand LHS:

2b² - b² y = 4y - 2y² - a² y

Bring all terms to one side:

2b² - b² y - 4y + 2y² + a² y = 0

Group like terms:

2y² + (-b² - 4 + a²) y + 2b² = 0

This is a quadratic in y:

2y² + (a² - b² - 4) y + 2b² = 0

Again, this seems complex, but maybe using the fact that a + b = 1 and a - b = 2(x - y), which relates a and b.

Earlier, we had a - b = 2(x - y) and a + b = 1.

Let me denote d = x - y. Then, a - b = 2d and a + b = 1.

So, adding these two equations: 2a = 1 + 2d => a = (1 + 2d)/2

Subtracting: 2b = 1 - 2d => b = (1 - 2d)/2

So, a = (1 + 2d)/2, b = (1 - 2d)/2

Given that a and b are non-negative, since they are square roots:

a ≥ 0 => (1 + 2d)/2 ≥ 0 => 1 + 2d ≥ 0 => d ≥ -1/2

b ≥ 0 => (1 - 2d)/2 ≥ 0 => 1 - 2d ≥ 0 => d ≤ 1/2

So, x - y = d ∈ [-1/2, 1/2]

But x and y are positive, and since x, y < 2, maybe d isn't too large.

But still, not sure how helpful this is.

Wait, going back to the expressions for a² and b²:

a² = x(2 - y)
b² = y(2 - x)

Express x and y in terms of a and b.

From a² = x(2 - y): x = a² / (2 - y)
From b² = y(2 - x): y = b² / (2 - x)

Substitute x from the first into the second:

y = b² / (2 - a² / (2 - y))

Simplify denominator:

= b² / [ (2(2 - y) - a²) / (2 - y) ) ]
= b² (2 - y) / (4 - 2y - a² )

Thus,

y = [ b² (2 - y) ] / (4 - 2y - a² )

Multiply both sides by denominator:

y(4 - 2y - a²) = b² (2 - y)

Expand:

4y - 2y² - a² y = 2b² - b² y

Bring all terms to left:

4y - 2y² - a² y - 2b² + b² y = 0

Group like terms:

(-2y²) + (4y - a² y + b² y) - 2b² = 0

Factor:

-2y² + y(4 - a² + b²) - 2b² = 0

Multiply through by -1:

2y² - y(4 - a² + b²) + 2b² = 0

Quadratic in y:

2y² - (4 - a² + b²) y + 2b² = 0

Again, complicated. Maybe express 4 - a² + b² in terms of a and b.

Recall that a + b = 1, so a² + 2ab + b² = 1. Thus, a² + b² = 1 - 2ab.

So, 4 - a² + b² = 4 - (a² - b²). Hmm, not sure.

Wait, 4 - a² + b² = 4 + (b² - a²). And b² - a² = (b - a)(b + a) = (b - a)(1). So, 4 - a² + b² = 4 + (b - a)

But earlier, a - b = 2d, so b - a = -2d. Thus, 4 - a² + b² = 4 - 2d

Therefore, our quadratic becomes:

2y² - (4 - 2d) y + 2b² = 0

Simplify:

2y² - 4y + 2d y + 2b² = 0

Divide both sides by 2:

y² - 2y + d y + b² = 0

Rearranged:

y² + (d - 2) y + b² = 0

Still complicated, but maybe use the earlier expressions for d and b in terms of a.

Wait, since d = x - y, and from a + b = 1, a = (1 + 2d)/2, b = (1 - 2d)/2

So, b² = [(1 - 2d)/2]^2 = (1 - 4d + 4d²)/4

Plug into the quadratic:

y² + (d - 2)y + (1 - 4d + 4d²)/4 = 0

Multiply through by 4:

4y² + 4(d - 2)y + 1 - 4d + 4d² = 0

Simplify:

4y² + 4d y - 8y + 1 - 4d + 4d² = 0

Group terms:

4y² + (4d - 8)y + (1 - 4d + 4d²) = 0

Divide entire equation by 4:

y² + (d - 2)y + (1/4 - d + d²) = 0

Not much better. Maybe complete the square or use quadratic formula.

Quadratic in y: y² + (d - 2)y + (d² - d + 1/4) = 0

Compute discriminant D:

D = (d - 2)^2 - 4*(1)*(d² - d + 1/4)

Expand:

= d² - 4d + 4 - 4d² + 4d - 1

Combine like terms:

= (d² - 4d²) + (-4d + 4d) + (4 - 1)
= (-3d²) + 0 + 3
= -3d² + 3
= 3(1 - d²)

So, y = [ -(d - 2) ± √(3(1 - d²)) ] / 2

Since y must be positive, take the positive root:

y = [ -d + 2 + √(3(1 - d²)) ] / 2

Similarly, remember that d = x - y, so x = y + d

So, once we find y, we can find x.

But this seems too involved. Perhaps trying another approach.

Wait, maybe suppose that the expressions √[x(2 - y)], etc., are proportional to something. For example, perhaps set each square root term equal to a multiple of a variable.

Alternatively, considering the first equation:

√[x(2 - y)] + √[y(2 - x)] = 1

Let me denote p = √[x(2 - y)] and q = √[y(2 - x)]

So, p + q = 1

Also, p² = x(2 - y) and q² = y(2 - x)

So, p² = 2x - xy and q² = 2y - xy

Subtracting the two equations:

p² - q² = 2x - xy - (2y - xy) = 2x - 2y

So, p² - q² = 2(x - y)

But p + q = 1, so p² - q² = (p - q)(p + q) = (p - q)(1) = p - q

Thus, p - q = 2(x - y)

But we already have p + q = 1 and p - q = 2(x - y). Let me write them together:

p + q = 1

p - q = 2(x - y)

Let me add and subtract these equations:

Adding: 2p = 1 + 2(x - y) ⇒ p = [1 + 2(x - y)] / 2

Subtracting: 2q = 1 - 2(x - y) ⇒ q = [1 - 2(x - y)] / 2

So, p = [1 + 2d]/2 and q = [1 - 2d]/2 where d = x - y.

Now, recall that p² = x(2 - y) and q² = y(2 - x). Let's compute p² + q²:

p² + q² = x(2 - y) + y(2 - x) = 2x - xy + 2y - xy = 2x + 2y - 2xy

But also, p² + q² = ([1 + 2d]/2)² + ([1 - 2d]/2)²

Compute this:

= (1 + 4d + 4d²)/4 + (1 - 4d + 4d²)/4
= [1 + 4d + 4d² + 1 - 4d + 4d²] / 4
= (2 + 8d²)/4
= (1 + 4d²)/2

Set equal to 2x + 2y - 2xy:

(1 + 4d²)/2 = 2x + 2y - 2xy

Multiply both sides by 2:

1 + 4d² = 4x + 4y - 4xy

But d = x - y, so substitute:

1 + 4(x - y)^2 = 4x + 4y - 4xy

Expand (x - y)^2:

= x² - 2xy + y²

So,

1 + 4x² - 8xy + 4y² = 4x + 4y - 4xy

Bring all terms to left:

1 + 4x² - 8xy + 4y² - 4x - 4y + 4xy = 0

Combine like terms:

4x² + 4y² - 4x - 4y - 4xy + 1 = 0

Divide entire equation by 4:

x² + y² - x - y - xy + 1/4 = 0

Hmm, quadratic in two variables. Maybe we can complete the square or find some substitution.

Let me rearrange terms:

x² - x + y² - y - xy + 1/4 = 0

Maybe group x terms and y terms:

x² - x - xy + y² - y + 1/4 = 0

Factor x terms:

x(x - 1 - y) + y² - y + 1/4 = 0

Not helpful. Alternatively, maybe treat this as quadratic in x:

x² - (1 + y)x + (y² - y + 1/4) = 0

Yes, quadratic in x:

x² - (1 + y)x + (y² - y + 1/4) = 0

Use quadratic formula:

x = [ (1 + y) ± √( (1 + y)^2 - 4*(y² - y + 1/4) ) ] / 2

Compute discriminant D:

D = (1 + y)^2 - 4(y² - y + 1/4)
= 1 + 2y + y² - 4y² + 4y - 1
= (1 - 1) + (2y + 4y) + (y² - 4y²)
= 6y - 3y²

So,

x = [1 + y ± √(6y - 3y²)] / 2

Simplify sqrt:

√(6y - 3y²) = √[3y(2 - y)]

So,

x = [1 + y ± √(3y(2 - y))] / 2

Since x must be positive, both numerator terms must be positive. Given that y is positive and less than 2 (from earlier constraints), the sqrt is real.

So, x is expressed in terms of y.

Similarly, perhaps do the same for the second equation.

But before that, let's see if we can find a relationship between x and y.

Alternatively, maybe instead of working with x and y, work with u = 2 - x, v = 2 - y, w = 2 - z.

Wait, let me try that substitution.

Let u = 2 - x, v = 2 - y, w = 2 - z. Then, since x, y, z < 2, u, v, w > 0.

Express the original equations in terms of u, v, w.

First equation:

√[x(2 - y)] + √[y(2 - x)] = √[xv] + √[yu] = 1

Similarly, second equation:

√[y(2 - z)] + √[z(2 - y)] = √[yw] + √[zv] = √2

Third equation:

√[z(2 - x)] + √[x(2 - z)] = √[zu] + √[xw] = √3

So, we have:

1. √(xv) + √(yu) = 1
2. √(yw) + √(zv) = √2
3. √(zu) + √(xw) = √3

Interesting! So, each equation is now √(product of two variables) summed up.

Moreover, note that u = 2 - x, v = 2 - y, w = 2 - z.

So, perhaps define new variables:

Let’s set a = √(xu), b = √(yv), c = √(zw)

But wait, in the first equation, we have √(xv) + √(yu) = 1.

Which is √(xv) + √(yu) = 1.

But since u = 2 - x, v = 2 - y, w = 2 - z.

Wait, perhaps not directly useful. Alternatively, maybe think of all variables u, v, w and the products xv, yu, etc.

Wait, actually, if I consider the first equation: √(xv) + √(yu) = 1

Similarly, second: √(yw) + √(zv) = √2

Third: √(zu) + √(xw) = √3

These look like equations in terms of √(xv), √(yu), etc.

Let me denote:

Let p = √(xv), q = √(yu), r = √(yw), s = √(zv), t = √(zu), k = √(xw)

But this introduces six variables, which complicates things.

Alternatively, observe that each equation has two square roots, which suggests that maybe the products xv, yu, etc., can be related to each other.

Wait, let me note that:

From the first equation: p + q = 1, where p = √(xv), q = √(yu)

From the second equation: r + s = √2, where r = √(yw), s = √(zv)

From the third equation: t + k = √3, where t = √(zu), k = √(xw)

But I don't see an immediate relation between p, q, r, s, t, k.

Alternatively, maybe consider multiplying all three equations.

But before that, perhaps express u, v, w in terms of x, y, z.

Wait, u = 2 - x, v = 2 - y, w = 2 - z.

So, for example, xv = x(2 - y), which was part of the first equation.

Wait, maybe if I multiply all three equations:

(√(xv) + √(yu))(√(yw) + √(zv))(√(zu) + √(xw)) = 1 * √2 * √3 = √6

But expanding the left side seems complicated. Maybe not the best approach.

Alternatively, maybe square each equation to eliminate square roots.

Starting with the first equation:

(√(xv) + √(yu))² = 1

Which is xv + yu + 2√(xv yu) = 1

Similarly, second equation squared:

(yw + zv + 2√(yw zv)) = 2

Third equation squared:

(zu + xw + 2√(zu xw)) = 3

So, now we have:

1. xv + yu + 2√(xv yu) = 1
2. yw + zv + 2√(yw zv) = 2
3. zu + xw + 2√(zu xw) = 3

Hmm, still complicated.

Wait, but remember that u = 2 - x, v = 2 - y, w = 2 - z.

So, we can write:

xv = x(2 - y)

yu = y(2 - x)

yw = y(2 - z)

zv = z(2 - y)

zu = z(2 - x)

xw = x(2 - z)

So, perhaps substitute these expressions.

Equation 1 becomes:

x(2 - y) + y(2 - x) + 2√[x(2 - y) * y(2 - x)] = 1

Which simplifies to:

2x - xy + 2y - xy + 2√[xy(2 - x)(2 - y)] = 1

Which is:

2x + 2y - 2xy + 2√[xy(2 - x)(2 - y)] = 1

Divide both sides by 2:

x + y - xy + √[xy(2 - x)(2 - y)] = 1/2

Similarly, process Equation 2:

yw + zv + 2√(yw zv) = 2

Which is:

y(2 - z) + z(2 - y) + 2√[y(2 - z) * z(2 - y)] = 2

Simplify:

2y - yz + 2z - yz + 2√[yz(2 - z)(2 - y)] = 2

Which is:

2y + 2z - 2yz + 2√[yz(2 - z)(2 - y)] = 2

Divide by 2:

y + z - yz + √[yz(2 - z)(2 - y)] = 1

Similarly, Equation 3:

zu + xw + 2√(zu xw) = 3

Which is:

z(2 - x) + x(2 - z) + 2√[z(2 - x) * x(2 - z)] = 3

Simplify:

2z - zx + 2x - xz + 2√[xz(2 - x)(2 - z)] = 3

Which is:

2z + 2x - 2xz + 2√[xz(2 - x)(2 - z)] = 3

Divide by 2:

z + x - xz + √[xz(2 - x)(2 - z)] = 3/2

So now, our three transformed equations are:

1. x + y - xy + √[xy(2 - x)(2 - y)] = 1/2  --- (A)
2. y + z - yz + √[yz(2 - y)(2 - z)] = 1    --- (B)
3. z + x - xz + √[xz(2 - x)(2 - z)] = 3/2  --- (C)

Hmm, still quite involved, but perhaps we can find a pattern or relations between these equations.

Looking at Equations (A), (B), and (C), each has a similar structure: sum of two variables minus their product plus a square root term equals a constant.

Maybe denote:

Let’s define:

For variables x and y: A = x + y - xy
B = y + z - yz
C = z + x - xz

And the square root terms:

√[xy(2 - x)(2 - y)] = √[xy(2 - x)(2 - y)]
√[yz(2 - y)(2 - z)] = √[yz(2 - y)(2 - z)]
√[xz(2 - x)(2 - z)] = √[xz(2 - x)(2 - z)]

Notice that each square root term is √[variable1*variable2*(2 - variable1)*(2 - variable2)]

Let me denote for each pair (x,y), (y,z), (z,x):

√[xy(2 - x)(2 - y)] = √[x(2 - x)y(2 - y)] = √[x(2 - x)] * √[y(2 - y)]

Similarly, the others:

√[yz(2 - y)(2 - z)] = √[y(2 - y)] * √[z(2 - z)]

√[xz(2 - x)(2 - z)] = √[x(2 - x)] * √[z(2 - z)]

So, if I denote:

Let p = √[x(2 - x)], q = √[y(2 - y)], r = √[z(2 - z)]

Then, the square root terms become pq, qr, rp respectively.

Thus, Equations (A), (B), (C) become:

(A): A + pq = 1/2

(B): B + qr = 1

(C): C + rp = 3/2

Where:

A = x + y - xy

B = y + z - yz

C = z + x - xz

So, now, we have:

1. A + pq = 1/2
2. B + qr = 1
3. C + rp = 3/2

Additionally, we can express A, B, C in terms of p, q, r.

Note that:

A = x + y - xy = (x + y) - xy

But since x = [p²]/(2 - x), wait, no. Earlier, p = √[x(2 - x)], so p² = x(2 - x)

Thus, x(2 - x) = p²

So, x = [2p² ± √(4p^4 - 4p²x²)] / 2

Wait, maybe not helpful. Alternatively, since p² = x(2 - x), we can write x = (2p²) / (2 - x), but that leads to quadratic again.

Wait, alternatively, maybe express A in terms of p and q.

Wait, A = x + y - xy

But p² = x(2 - x) → x² - 2x + p² = 0

Similarly, y² - 2y + q² = 0

But solving for x and y gives:

x = [2 ± √(4 - 4p²)] / 2 = 1 ± √(1 - p²)

Similarly, y = 1 ± √(1 - q²)

But since x and y are positive and less than 2, the ± signs matter.

Assuming that x = 1 - √(1 - p²) or x = 1 + √(1 - p²). Since x must be less than 2, both could be possible depending on p.

Wait, but when p approaches 0, x approaches 1. When p increases, x moves away from 1.

Wait, perhaps taking x = 1 + √(1 - p²) might cause x > 1, but since p² = x(2 - x), which is a downward parabola peaking at x=1, p² <=1. So, √(1 - p²) is real.

But regardless, expressing A in terms of p and q may not be straightforward.

Alternatively, perhaps express A = x + y - xy

= x(1 - y) + y

= y(1 - x) + x

But not sure.

Wait, another idea: Note that A + pq = 1/2, and similarly for others. Maybe multiply all three equations together.

( A + pq )( B + qr )( C + rp ) = (1/2)(1)(3/2) = 3/4

But expanding the left side:

(A + pq)(B + qr)(C + rp)

It's going to be messy, but maybe manageable.

Let me compute step by step:

First, compute (A + pq)(B + qr):

= AB + Aqr + Bpq + pq*qr

= AB + q(Ar + Bp) + p q² r

Now, multiply by (C + rp):

= [AB + q(Ar + Bp) + p q² r] * (C + rp)

= ABC + AB rp + q(Ar + Bp)C + q(Ar + Bp) rp + p q² r C + p q² r * rp

Wow, this is getting too complicated. Maybe not the best approach.

Alternative idea: Let me consider the three equations:

A + pq = 1/2

B + qr = 1

C + rp = 3/2

Let me express A, B, C in terms of p, q, r.

So,

A = 1/2 - pq

B = 1 - qr

C = 3/2 - rp

Additionally, note that:

A = x + y - xy

Similarly, B = y + z - yz

C = z + x - xz

But also, note that A + B + C = 2(x + y + z) - 2(xy + yz + zx)

But maybe not helpful.

Wait, perhaps consider that:

From A = x + y - xy = (x + y) - xy

Similarly, B = y + z - yz

C = z + x - xz

Adding A + B + C:

= 2(x + y + z) - 2(xy + yz + zx)

Which is equal to 2[(x + y + z) - (xy + yz + zx)]

But not sure.

Alternatively, maybe compute (1 - x)(1 - y)(1 - z). That often shows up in such problems.

Let me compute (1 - x)(1 - y)(1 - z):

= 1 - (x + y + z) + (xy + yz + zx) - xyz

Hmm, which is similar to expressions we might get.

But wait, we have A, B, C which are x + y - xy, etc. Let me see:

Compute (x + y - xy) + (y + z - yz) + (z + x - xz):

= 2(x + y + z) - 2(xy + yz + zx)

Which is 2[A + B + C] as above.

Alternatively, perhaps think of A, B, C as parts of (1 - x)(1 - y)(1 - z).

Wait, let's see:

(1 - x)(1 - y) = 1 - x - y + xy

Similarly, (1 - y)(1 - z) = 1 - y - z + yz

(1 - z)(1 - x) = 1 - z - x + xz

Each of these is similar to 1 - (sum of two variables) + (product of two variables)

But in our case, A = x + y - xy = (x + y) - xy, which is 1 - (1 - x - y + xy) = 1 - (1 - x)(1 - y) + something?

Wait, 1 - (1 - x)(1 - y) = x + y - xy, which is exactly A.

Similarly, B = y + z - yz = 1 - (1 - y)(1 - z)

C = z + x - xz = 1 - (1 - z)(1 - x)

Therefore,

A = 1 - (1 - x)(1 - y)

B = 1 - (1 - y)(1 - z)

C = 1 - (1 - z)(1 - x)

Thus, we can rewrite the equations as:

1. 1 - (1 - x)(1 - y) + pq = 1/2 ⇒ (1 - x)(1 - y) = pq + 1/2

2. 1 - (1 - y)(1 - z) + qr = 1 ⇒ (1 - y)(1 - z) = qr + 1

3. 1 - (1 - z)(1 - x) + rp = 3/2 ⇒ (1 - z)(1 - x) = rp + 1/2

So, now, we have:

Equation (D): (1 - x)(1 - y) = pq + 1/2

Equation (E): (1 - y)(1 - z) = qr + 1

Equation (F): (1 - z)(1 - x) = rp + 1/2

Now, let me denote:

Let’s let a = (1 - x)(1 - y), b = (1 - y)(1 - z), c = (1 - z)(1 - x)

Then, Equations (D)-(F) become:

a = pq + 1/2

b = qr + 1

c = rp + 1/2

Also, note that a * b * c = [(1 - x)(1 - y)(1 - z)]² = [(1 - x)(1 - y)(1 - z)]²

Which is [ (1 - x)(1 - y)(1 - z) ]²

But from the definition, a*b*c = [ (1 - x)(1 - y)(1 - z) ]²

Also, note that a + b + c = (1 - x)(1 - y) + (1 - y)(1 - z) + (1 - z)(1 - x)

Which expands to:

= (1 - x - y + xy) + (1 - y - z + yz) + (1 - z - x + xz)

= 3 - 2(x + y + z) + (xy + yz + zx)

Not sure if helpful.

Wait, but perhaps take the product a * b * c:

a * b * c = (pq + 1/2)(qr + 1)(rp + 1/2)

This seems complicated, but maybe expand it.

Alternatively, maybe assume that (1 - x)(1 - y)(1 - z) is something manageable.

Let me denote M = (1 - x)(1 - y)(1 - z)

Then, M² = a * b * c = (pq + 1/2)(qr + 1)(rp + 1/2)

But we don't know pq, qr, rp yet.

But perhaps relate a, b, c:

From a = pq + 1/2, so pq = a - 1/2

From b = qr + 1, so qr = b - 1

From c = rp + 1/2, so rp = c - 1/2

So,

pq = a - 1/2

qr = b - 1

rp = c - 1/2

Multiply all three:

(pqr)² = (a - 1/2)(b - 1)(c - 1/2)

But pqr = √[x(2 - x)] √[y(2 - y)] √[z(2 - z)] = √[x y z (2 - x)(2 - y)(2 - z)] = √[xyzw], since w = 2 - z.

But not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps consider that:

From pq = a - 1/2

qr = b - 1

rp = c - 1/2

Multiplying these gives:

(pqr)² = (a - 1/2)(b - 1)(c - 1/2)

But also, pqr = √[x(2 - x) y(2 - y) z(2 - z)] = √[xyz(2 - x)(2 - y)(2 - z)] = √[xyzw]

But M = (1 - x)(1 - y)(1 - z) = ?

Wait, but we also have u = 2 - x, v = 2 - y, w = 2 - z.

So, M = (1 - x)(1 - y)(1 - z) = (1 - x)(1 - y)(1 - z)

But 1 - x = (2 - x) - 1 = u - 1

Similarly, 1 - y = v - 1, 1 - z = w - 1

Thus, M = (u - 1)(v - 1)(w - 1)

But I don't know if that's helpful.

Alternatively, note that:

From the definitions:

u = 2 - x, so x = 2 - u

Similarly, y = 2 - v, z = 2 - w

So, 1 - x = 1 - (2 - u) = u - 1

Similarly, 1 - y = v - 1, 1 - z = w - 1

Thus, M = (u - 1)(v - 1)(w - 1)

But also, M = (1 - x)(1 - y)(1 - z)

But I don't know if that connection helps.

Alternatively, perhaps think of a, b, c as follows:

We have:

a = (1 - x)(1 - y) = pq + 1/2

Similarly, b = (1 - y)(1 - z) = qr + 1

c = (1 - z)(1 - x) = rp + 1/2

So, we can write:

a = (1 - x)(1 - y) = pq + 1/2

c = (1 - z)(1 - x) = rp + 1/2

Multiply a and c:

a * c = (1 - x)^2 (1 - y)(1 - z) = (1 - x) * M

Similarly, from above:

a * c = (pq + 1/2)(rp + 1/2)

But I think this is getting too convoluted.

Alternative Idea:

Maybe express the product M = (1 - x)(1 - y)(1 - z)

We need to find [(1 - x)(1 - y)(1 - z)]², which is M². So, if we can find M², that would be the desired value.

From the previous equations, we have:

a = (1 - x)(1 - y) = pq + 1/2

b = (1 - y)(1 - z) = qr + 1

c = (1 - z)(1 - x) = rp + 1/2

So, M = (1 - x)(1 - y)(1 - z) = a * (1 - z) = ?

Wait, no.

Wait, a = (1 - x)(1 - y), b = (1 - y)(1 - z), c = (1 - z)(1 - x)

So, M = a * (1 - z) / (1 - y) ??? Not sure.

Alternatively, multiply all three:

a * b * c = (1 - x)^2 (1 - y)^2 (1 - z)^2 = M²

Thus, M² = a * b * c

So, if we can compute a * b * c, we get M².

From above, we have:

a = pq + 1/2

b = qr + 1

c = rp + 1/2

So, a * b * c = (pq + 1/2)(qr + 1)(rp + 1/2)

Let me compute this:

First, compute (pq + 1/2)(qr + 1):

= pq * qr + pq * 1 + (1/2)*qr * qr + (1/2)*qr

= p q² r + pq + (1/2) q² r² + (1/2) qr

Then, multiply this by (rp + 1/2):

= [ p q² r + pq + (1/2) q² r² + (1/2) qr ] * (rp + 1/2)

This will result in multiple terms:

1. p q² r * rp = p q² r * r p = p² q² r²

2. p q² r * 1/2 = (1/2) p q² r

3. pq * rp = p q * r p = p² q r

4. pq * 1/2 = (1/2) pq

5. (1/2) q² r² * rp = (1/2) q² r² * r p = (1/2) p q² r³

6. (1/2) q² r² * 1/2 = (1/4) q² r²

7. (1/2) qr * rp = (1/2) q r * r p = (1/2) p q r²

8. (1/2) qr * 1/2 = (1/4) qr

So, combining all terms:

1. p² q² r²

2. (1/2) p q² r

3. p² q r

4. (1/2) p q

5. (1/2) p q² r³

6. (1/4) q² r²

7. (1/2) p q r²

8. (1/4) q r

So, putting them all together:

= p² q² r² + (1/2) p q² r + p² q r + (1/2) p q + (1/2) p q² r³ + (1/4) q² r² + (1/2) p q r² + (1/4) q r

This is very complicated. Maybe not the right path.

Wait, stepping back, maybe make an assumption that all variables are equal.

Suppose x = y = z. Then, we can test if this satisfies the equations.

Let me check:

First equation:

√(2x - x²) + √(2x - x²) = 1

Which is 2√(2x - x²) = 1 ⇒ √(2x - x²) = 1/2 ⇒ 2x - x² = 1/4 ⇒ x² - 2x + 1/4 = 0 ⇒ (x - 1)^2 = 3/4 ⇒ x = 1 ± (√3)/2

But x must be less than 2, so both solutions are valid. Similarly for y and z.

But then, let's see if the second equation holds:

√(2y - y²) + √(2y - y²) = √2

Which would be 2√(2y - y²) = √2 ⇒ √(2y - y²) = √2 / 2 ⇒ 2y - y² = (√2 / 2)^2 = 1/2

Same equation as before: y² - 2y + 1/2 = 0 ⇒ y = 1 ± (√(4 - 2))/2 = 1 ± √2/2

But then, x and y would have different values unless √3 / 2 = √2 / 2, which is not true.

Hence, x, y, z cannot all be equal.

Therefore, variables are distinct.

Another Idea:

Given the complexity, maybe assign numerical values or think of M as a variable.

Wait, ultimately, we need to find [(1 - x)(1 - y)(1 - z)]², which is M²
