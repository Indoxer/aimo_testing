 The problem: 
Call a positive integer $n$ extra-distinct if the remainders when $n$ is divided by $2, 3, 4, 5,$ and $6$ are distinct. Find the number of extra-distinct positive integers less than $1000$.


Alright, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of extra-distinct positive integers less than 1000. An extra-distinct number n is defined as a positive integer where the remainders when n is divided by 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are all distinct. Hmm, okay. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let me understand what it means for the remainders to be distinct. When we divide n by each of these numbers (2, 3, 4, 5, 6), the remainders should all be different from each other. So, for example, if n divided by 2 leaves a remainder of 0, then dividing n by 3 shouldn't leave 0, nor should it leave any other remainder that's already been taken by another division.

I think it would help to write out the possible remainders for each divisor:

- Dividing by 2: possible remainders are 0 or 1.
- Dividing by 3: possible remainders are 0, 1, or 2.
- Dividing by 4: possible remainders are 0, 1, 2, or 3.
- Dividing by 5: possible remainders are 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4.
- Dividing by 6: possible remainders are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.

Since we're dealing with five divisors, there are 5 remainders, and they must all be distinct. That means each remainder has to be unique across all divisions. Now, considering the range of possible remainders, which go up to 5, but since we're dividing by 6, the maximum remainder is 5. But actually, wait, some of the divisors have smaller ranges, like 2 can only give remainders 0 or 1.

Let me note that the remainder when dividing by a number m is always less than m. So, the possible remainders for each are constrained. This might limit how many distinct remainders we can get, especially because some divisors have overlapping ranges.

Wait a second, let's think about the maximum number of distinct remainders possible. Since we have five divisors, we need five distinct remainders. However, the maximum remainder when dividing by 6 is 5, so in theory, the remainders could range from 0 to 5. But not necessarily all of them will be present because some divisors don't have high enough remainders. For example, dividing by 2 only gives 0 or 1, so we can't have a remainder higher than 1 when divided by 2. Similarly, dividing by 3 only gives up to 2.

So, perhaps the set of remainders must include numbers from 0 up to at least 4 or something? Because the divisor 5 can give us up to 4, and 6 gives up to 5. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the remainders when divided by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 must all be distinct, but also, each remainder must be less than its respective divisor.

To tackle this, perhaps I can model the problem by setting up equations based on the remainders.

Let me denote:
- r2 = n mod 2
- r3 = n mod 3
- r4 = n mod 4
- r5 = n mod 5
- r6 = n mod 6

We know that r2, r3, r4, r5, r6 must all be distinct. Also, each remainder satisfies 0 ≤ r < m, where m is the respective divisor.

Moreover, since 4 is a multiple of 2, n mod 4 must relate to n mod 2. Specifically, if n mod 4 is 0 or 1, then n mod 2 is equal to that value. If n mod 4 is 2 or 3, then n mod 2 is 0 or 1, respectively. So, r2 is determined by r4.

Similarly, 6 is a multiple of 2 and 3, so n mod 6 is related to both n mod 2 and n mod 3. In particular, n mod 6 is congruent to n mod 2 and n mod 3 simultaneously. Therefore, r6 is determined by r2 and r3.

Given that, perhaps I can express some of the remainders in terms of others, which might reduce the number of variables I need to consider.

Let me attempt to formalize this.

From the relationship between mod 2 and mod 4:

If r4 is 0 or 1, then r2 = r4.

If r4 is 2 or 3, then r2 = r4 - 2.

So, r2 is either equal to r4 (if r4 is 0 or 1) or equal to r4 - 2 (if r4 is 2 or 3). Therefore, r2 is uniquely determined by r4.

Similarly, for mod 3 and mod 6:

n mod 6 is equal to n mod 3 if n mod 2 is 0, or n mod 6 is equal to (n mod 3 + 3) if n mod 2 is 1.

But perhaps more directly, since n mod 6 is equivalent to both n mod 2 and n mod 3, we can say that r6 ≡ r2 mod 2 and r6 ≡ r3 mod 3.

This might complicate things, but maybe I can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) concepts here.

Wait, but maybe instead of trying to handle all these congruencies, I can look for constraints on n such that all the remainders are distinct.

Let me think about the possible values of the remainders:

r2 ∈ {0, 1}

r3 ∈ {0, 1, 2}

r4 ∈ {0, 1, 2, 3}

r5 ∈ {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}

r6 ∈ {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

Since all these must be distinct, let's see what possibilities there are for the set {r2, r3, r4, r5, r6}.

Given that r2 can only be 0 or 1, and r3 can be 0,1,2, etc., perhaps the set must contain numbers from 0 up to 4 or 5, but without overlap.

But let me think: since r2 is either 0 or 1, and r3 can be 0,1,2, but needs to be distinct from r2. Similarly, r4 can be 0,1,2,3; must be distinct from r2, r3, etc.

Wait, but given that r2 is either 0 or 1, and r3 can be 0,1,2, but different from r2.

Suppose r2 is 0. Then, r3 can be 1 or 2 (since it can't be 0 because r2 is 0). Then, r4 can be 1,2,3 (but must differ from r2=0 and r3).

Wait, no, hold on. If r2 is 0, then r3 can be 1 or 2. Suppose r3 is 1, then r4 can be 2 or 3, since 0 and 1 are taken. Similarly, r5 can be 2,3,4, but must differ from previous remainders.

Wait, this seems complicated. Maybe a better approach is to note that the remainders must all be distinct, so the set {r2, r3, r4, r5, r6} must be a subset of {0,1,2,3,4,5} with exactly 5 elements, and all distinct.

But since n is being divided by 2,3,4,5,6, and the remainders are r2,...,r6, each of these must be unique.

Additionally, n must satisfy n ≡ r2 mod 2, n ≡ r3 mod 3, etc.

Perhaps instead of handling each case separately, I can figure out what possible sets of remainders are allowed.

Since r2 is either 0 or 1, let's consider two cases:

Case 1: r2 = 0

Then, n is even.

Therefore, r4 must be either 0,1,2, or 3. However, since n is even, r4 must be equal to r2 or r2 + 2. Wait, actually, earlier I thought that r2 is determined by r4, but perhaps the reverse is true. Wait, no, earlier reasoning was that r2 is determined by r4. If n mod 4 is 0 or 1, then n mod 2 is 0 or 1. If n mod 4 is 2 or 3, then n mod 2 is 0 or 1, respectively.

So, in Case 1 where r2 = 0, r4 can be 0, 1, 2, or 3, but n mod 2 is 0, which happens when n mod 4 is 0 or 2.

Similarly, if r2 = 1, then r4 must be 1 or 3.

So, going back to Case 1: r2 = 0.

Thus, n is even. So, n mod 4 is 0,1,2,3, but n mod 2 is 0, so n mod 4 must be 0 or 2.

Hence, in Case 1, r4 can be 0 or 2.

But wait, n mod 4 is either 0 or 2, so r4 is either 0 or 2.

Wait, but if n mod 4 is 0, then r4 = 0, and n mod 2 is 0.

If n mod 4 is 2, then r4 = 2, and n mod 2 is 0.

So, in either subcase, r2 = 0, and r4 is either 0 or 2.

But hold on, r4 must be different from r2?

No, wait, the remainders just need to be distinct among themselves. So, r4 can be equal to r2 if r4 is 0, but then the remainder when divided by 4 is 0, same as remainder when divided by 2. But in that case, r4 and r2 would be the same, which violates the distinctness condition.

Ah! So, in fact, if r2 = 0, then r4 cannot be 0, because that would make r2 = r4, which is not allowed. Similarly, if r2 = 1, then r4 cannot be 1, because again, they would be equal.

Therefore, in Case 1: r2 = 0.

So, n is even, meaning r2 = 0.

But r4 can't be 0 because that would duplicate r2.

Thus, r4 must be 2, since r4 can't be 0 or 1 (as n mod 4 can't be 1 if n is even). Wait, n mod 4 is 0,1,2,3, but n is even, so n mod 4 is 0 or 2. So, r4 can be 0 or 2, but since r2 is 0, r4 can't be 0, so r4 must be 2.

Therefore, in Case 1: r2 = 0, r4 = 2.

Similarly, moving on.

Now, r3 is the remainder when n is divided by 3. It can be 0,1,2.

But since r2 = 0, and r4 = 2, so far our remainders are 0,2, and whatever r3 is.

Also, remember that r3 must be different from r2 and r4, so if r3 is 0, it conflicts with r2; if it's 2, conflicts with r4. Therefore, r3 must be 1.

Therefore, in Case 1, r3 = 1.

So now, our remainders are: r2=0, r3=1, r4=2.

Moving on to r5.

r5 is the remainder when n is divided by 5, which can be 0,1,2,3,4.

It must be different from r2, r3, r4, so it can't be 0,1,2. Therefore, r5 must be 3 or 4.

Similarly, r6 is the remainder when n is divided by 6, which can be 0,1,2,3,4,5.

It must be different from r2=0, r3=1, r4=2, r5.

So, let's consider r5 first.

In Case 1, r5 can be 3 or 4.

Subcase 1a: r5 = 3.

Then, r6 must be different from 0,1,2,3. So, r6 can be 4 or 5.

But wait, let's check if that's possible.

r6 is the remainder when n is divided by 6, so it's n mod 6.

But n is known modulo 2,3,4,5,6.

Wait, but if n mod 2=0, n mod 3=1, n mod 4=2, n mod 5=3, then we can solve for n modulo lcm(2,3,4,5)=60.

Using the Chinese Remainder Theorem.

So, n ≡ 0 mod 2,

n ≡ 1 mod 3,

n ≡ 2 mod 4,

n ≡ 3 mod 5.

Let me try solving these congruences.

First, n ≡ 0 mod 2,

n ≡ 1 mod 3,

n ≡ 2 mod 4,

n ≡ 3 mod 5.

Let me start with the first two: n ≡ 0 mod 2 and n ≡ 1 mod 3.

Numbers that are 0 mod 2 are even numbers. Numbers that are 1 mod 3 are numbers like 1,4,7,10,...

Looking for common solutions: let's list numbers that are 1 mod 3 and even.

1 mod 3 is 1,4,7,10,13,16,19,22,25,28,...

Among these, the even ones are 4,10,16,22,28,...

So, n ≡ 4 mod 6.

Because 4 is the smallest even number that is 1 mod 3, and then adding multiples of 6 (the lcm of 2 and 3).

So, n ≡ 4 mod 6.

Now, next congruence: n ≡ 2 mod 4.

So, n ≡ 4 mod 6 and n ≡ 2 mod 4.

Find n that satisfies both.

Express n as 6k + 4.

Plug into n ≡ 2 mod 4: 6k + 4 ≡ 2 mod 4 => 6k ≡ -2 mod 4 => 6k ≡ 2 mod 4.

Simplify: 6k ≡ 2 mod 4. Since 6 ≡ 2 mod 4, so 2k ≡ 2 mod 4 => k ≡ 1 mod 2.

Therefore, k is odd, so k = 2m + 1.

Thus, n = 6*(2m + 1) + 4 = 12m + 6 + 4 = 12m + 10.

So, n ≡ 10 mod 12.

Now, add the last congruence: n ≡ 3 mod 5.

So, n ≡ 10 mod 12 and n ≡ 3 mod 5.

Express n as 12m + 10.

Plug into n ≡ 3 mod 5: 12m + 10 ≡ 3 mod 5.

12m ≡ -7 mod 5 => 12m ≡ (-7 + 10) mod 5 => 12m ≡ 3 mod 5.

But 12 ≡ 2 mod 5, so 2m ≡ 3 mod 5.

Multiply both sides by inverse of 2 mod 5, which is 3 because 2*3=6≡1 mod5.

Thus, m ≡ 3*3 ≡ 9 ≡ 4 mod5.

Therefore, m = 5k + 4.

Thus, n = 12*(5k +4)+10 = 60k + 48 +10=60k +58.

Therefore, n ≡58 mod60.

So, in Subcase 1a where r5=3, n ≡58 mod60.

Therefore, the general solution is n=60k +58.

Now, what is r6 in this case?

r6 is n mod6. Since n=60k +58, 60k is divisible by 6, so n mod6=58 mod6.

58 divided by6 is 9*6=54, so 58-54=4. So, r6=4.

Therefore, in Subcase 1a, r6=4.

Now, let's check the remainders:

r2=0, r3=1, r4=2, r5=3, r6=4.

These are all distinct, as required.

So, Subcase 1a is valid.

Now, Subcase 1b: r5=4.

So, similar process, but now n mod5=4.

Again, starting with n ≡0 mod2, n≡1 mod3, n≡2 mod4, n≡4 mod5.

Let me solve these congruences.

Start with n≡0 mod2 and n≡1 mod3: as before, n≡4 mod6.

So, n=6k+4.

Next, n≡2 mod4: plug into n=6k+4: 6k+4≡2 mod4.

6k ≡ -2 mod4 => 6k≡2 mod4. 6≡2 mod4, so 2k≡2 mod4 => k≡1 mod2. So, k=2m+1.

Thus, n=6*(2m+1)+4=12m+6+4=12m+10. So, n≡10 mod12.

Now, add the last congruence: n≡4 mod5.

So, n=12m +10≡4 mod5.

Compute 12m +10 mod5: 12≡2 mod5, 10≡0 mod5.

So, 2m +0≡4 mod5 => 2m≡4 mod5 => m≡2 mod5 (since inverse of 2 is 3, so 3*4=12≡2 mod5, wait, wait, actually, 2m≡4 implies m≡2 mod5 because 2*2=4.

Yes, correct. So, m=5k +2.

Thus, n=12*(5k +2) +10=60k +24 +10=60k +34.

Therefore, n≡34 mod60.

So, the general solution is n=60k +34.

Now, compute r6=n mod6.

n=60k +34.

60k is divisible by6, so 34 mod6: 34 divided by6 is 5*6=30, so 34-30=4. Thus, r6=4.

Wait, so r6=4.

So, the remainders are:

r2=0, r3=1, r4=2, r5=4, r6=4.

Wait, hold on, r5=4 and r6=4. So, they are the same. That's a problem because all remainders must be distinct.

Therefore, in Subcase 1b, where r5=4, r6=4, which duplicates r5, so this isn't acceptable.

Therefore, Subcase 1b leads to a conflict, so we discard it.

Therefore, in Case1: r2=0, r4=2, r3=1, and r5 must be 3, leading to n≡58 mod60, and r6=4. So, remainders are 0,1,2,3,4—all distinct. So, that works.

So, in Case1, the solutions are numbers congruent to 58 mod60.

Now, moving on to Case2: r2=1.

So, n is odd, because n mod2=1.

Therefore, n mod4 can be 1 or 3, since n is odd. So, r4 can be 1 or3.

But wait, n is odd, so n mod4 is either 1 or3.

But remember, the remainders have to be distinct.

Also, r2=1, so r4 cannot be1 because then r2 and r4 would both be1, which is not allowed.

Therefore, in Case2: r2=1, so r4 must be3.

So, in Case2: r2=1, r4=3.

Proceeding.

Now, r3: n mod3. It can be 0,1,2.

But since r2=1, and r4=3, which is unique, so r3 must be different from1 and3.

But r3 can be 0,1,2. So, it can't be1, so it must be0 or2.

But n is odd, so n mod3 can be0,1,2. If n is odd, n mod3 can still be0,1, or2 regardless.

But n mod3=r3≠1, because r2=1, so r3 must be0 or2.

So, Subcase2a: r3=0.

Subcase2b: r3=2.

Let's analyze each.

Subcase2a: r3=0.

So, n ≡0 mod3.

Now, n must satisfy n≡1 mod2, n≡3 mod4, n≡0 mod3.

We can solve these congruences.

Express n as follows:

n ≡1 mod2,

n ≡0 mod3,

n ≡3 mod4.

Let me solve these step by step.

First, n ≡1 mod2 and n≡0 mod3.

Numbers divisible by3 are 0,3,6,9,... Among these, the odd ones are3,9,15,... So, n≡3 mod6.

So, n=6k +3.

Now, apply the third congruence: n≡3 mod4.

So, 6k +3 ≡3 mod4 =>6k≡0 mod4.

Simplify: 6k ≡0 mod4. Since 6≡2 mod4, so 2k≡0 mod4 =>k≡0 mod2.

Therefore, k=2m.

Thus, n=6*(2m)+3=12m +3.

So, n≡3 mod12.

Now, proceed to r5.

In this case, n=12m +3.

So, n mod5 can be0,1,2,3,4.

It must be different from r2=1, r3=0, r4=3.

So, r5 can be2,4.

So, r5=2 or4.

Let's explore both possibilities.

Subsubcase2a1: r5=2.

So, n mod5=2.

Thus, n=12m +3≡2 mod5.

So, 12m +3 ≡2 mod5 =>12m≡-1 mod5 =>12m≡4 mod5.

12≡2 mod5, so 2m≡4 mod5 => m≡2 mod5 (since 2*2=4).

Therefore, m=5k +2.

Thus, n=12*(5k +2) +3=60k +24 +3=60k +27.

Therefore, n≡27 mod60.

Now, compute r6: n mod6.

n=60k +27.

60k is divisible by6, so 27 mod6=3.

Thus, r6=3.

So, the remainders are:

r2=1, r3=0, r4=3, r5=2, r6=3.

Wait, hold on, r4=3 and r6=3. They are the same, which violates the distinctness condition. So, this is invalid.

Therefore, Subsubcase2a1 is invalid.

Subsubcase2a2: r5=4.

So, n mod5=4.

Thus, n=12m +3≡4 mod5.

12m +3 ≡4 mod5 =>12m≡1 mod5.

12≡2 mod5, so 2m≡1 mod5.

Multiply both sides by inverse of2 mod5, which is3, since2*3=6≡1 mod5.

Thus, m≡3*1≡3 mod5.

Therefore, m=5k +3.

Thus, n=12*(5k +3)+3=60k +36 +3=60k +39.

Therefore, n≡39 mod60.

Compute r6: n mod6.

n=60k +39.

60k is divisible by6, so 39 mod6=3.

Thus, r6=3.

Again, remainders: r2=1, r3=0, r4=3, r5=4, r6=3.

Here, r4=3 and r6=3 are duplicates. So, invalid.

Therefore, both Subsubcases under Subcase2a lead to duplicate remainders, so Subcase2a is invalid.

Now, moving to Subcase2b: r3=2.

So, n ≡2 mod3.

So, n must satisfy n≡1 mod2, n≡3 mod4, n≡2 mod3.

Let me solve these congruences.

Express n as:

n≡1 mod2,

n≡3 mod4,

n≡2 mod3.

First, n≡1 mod2 and n≡3 mod4.

As before, n≡3 mod4 automatically satisfies n≡1 mod2 because 3 is odd.

So, n=4k +3.

Now, n≡2 mod3: 4k +3≡2 mod3 =>4k≡-1 mod3 =>4k≡2 mod3.

4≡1 mod3, so k≡2 mod3.

Therefore, k=3m +2.

Thus, n=4*(3m +2) +3=12m +8 +3=12m +11.

So, n≡11 mod12.

Now, proceed to r5.

n=12m +11.

n mod5 can be0,1,2,3,4.

It must be different from r2=1, r3=2, r4=3.

Therefore, r5 can be0,4.

So, r5=0 or4.

Let's analyze both.

Subsubcase2b1: r5=0.

So, n mod5=0.

Thus, 12m +11≡0 mod5 =>12m≡-11 mod5 =>12m≡-11 +15=4 mod5.

12≡2 mod5, so 2m≡4 mod5 => m≡2 mod5.

Thus, m=5k +2.

Therefore, n=12*(5k +2) +11=60k +24 +11=60k +35.

Thus, n≡35 mod60.

Compute r6: n mod6.

n=60k +35.

60k divisible by6, 35 mod6=5.

Thus, r6=5.

Now, check the remainders:

r2=1, r3=2, r4=3, r5=0, r6=5.

All are distinct! Great.

So, Subsubcase2b1 is valid.

Subsubcase2b2: r5=4.

So, n mod5=4.

Thus, 12m +11≡4 mod5 =>12m≡-7 mod5 =>12m≡-7 +10=3 mod5.

12≡2 mod5, so 2m≡3 mod5.

Multiply both sides by inverse of2 mod5, which is3: m≡3*3=9≡4 mod5.

Therefore, m=5k +4.

Thus, n=12*(5k +4) +11=60k +48 +11=60k +59.

So, n≡59 mod60.

Compute r6: n mod6.

n=60k +59.

60k divisible by6, 59 mod6=59-54=5.

Thus, r6=5.

Check remainders:

r2=1, r3=2, r4=3, r5=4, r6=5.

All distinct. Perfect.

Therefore, both Subsubcases2b1 and2b2 are valid.

So, in Case2, Subcase2b where r3=2, we have two solutions:

n≡35 mod60 and n≡59 mod60.

Thus, summarizing:

Case1: n≡58 mod60.

Case2: n≡35 mod60 and n≡59 mod60.

Therefore, overall, the solutions are numbers congruent to35,58,59 mod60.

So, every 60 numbers, there are three solutions:35,58,59.

Therefore, in the range1 to N, the number of solutions is approximately N/60 *3.

But since we need numbers less than1000, i.e., up to999, we need to calculate how many full cycles of60 fit into999, and then count the remaining numbers.

First, compute how many full periods: floor(999 /60)=floor(16.65)=16.

Each full period contributes3 solutions, so16*3=48.

Now, check the remaining numbers beyond16*60=960.

From961 to999, that's39 numbers.

We need to check how many of the solutions fall into this range.

The solutions are numbers congruent to35,58,59 mod60.

So, starting from961, the next number congruent to35 mod60 would be960 +35=995.

Then,960 +58=1018, which is beyond999.

Similarly,960 +59=1019, also beyond.

So, in the range961-999, only995 is a solution.

Therefore, total number of solutions less than1000 is16*3 +1=49.

Wait, but let me verify.

Wait, 16 full cycles: each cycle is60 numbers, contributing3 solutions.

So, 16*60=960.

Number of solutions up to960:16*3=48.

Then, from961 to999:39 numbers.

Looking for numbers congruent to35,58,59 mod60.

What is960 +35=995, which is<=999.

960 +58=1018>999.

960 +59=1019>999.

Thus, only995 is in the range961-999.

Thus, total solutions:48 +1=49.

Wait, but let me double-check.

Wait, is995 less than1000? Yes, 995<1000.

Is995 included in our count? Yes.

Therefore, 49 numbers.

But wait, let me confirm whether995 is indeed an extra solution.

Alternatively, perhaps my initial calculation missed something.

Wait, the number of solutions per cycle is3, so for16 cycles, 48 solutions.

Then, in the partial cycle from961-999, which is39 numbers, only one solution exists at995.

Thus, total solutions=48 +1=49.

But let me think differently: maybe I made a mistake in calculating the number of solutions per cycle.

Wait, in the first cycle (1-60), the solutions are35,58,59.

So,3 solutions.

Similarly, in the next cycle61-120,121-180,...,961-1020, each has3 solutions.

But since we need only up to999, which is less than1020, the last partial cycle has1 solution.

Therefore, total=16*3 +1=49.

Therefore, the total number of extra-distinct positive integers less than1000 is49.

Hence, the answer is\boxed{49}.

To determine the number of extra-distinct positive integers less than 1000, we need to find integers \( n \) such that the remainders when \( n \) is divided by 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are distinct.

We denote the remainders as:
- \( r_2 = n \mod 2 \)
- \( r_3 = n \mod 3 \)
- \( r_4 = n \mod 4 \)
- \( r_5 = n \mod 5 \)
- \( r_6 = n \mod 6 \)

These remainders must be distinct. We analyze the possible values of \( n \) modulo 60, as 60 is the least common multiple of 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.

### Case Analysis:
1. **Case 1: \( r_2 = 0 \)**
   - \( r_4 = 2 \)
   - \( r_3 = 1 \)
   - \( r_5 = 3 \)
   - Solving the congruences, we find \( n \equiv 58 \mod 60 \).

2. **Case 2: \( r_2 = 1 \)**
   - \( r_4 = 3 \)
   - Subcase 2a: \( r_3 = 0 \) leads to conflicts.
   - Subcase 2b: \( r_3 = 2 \) leads to solutions:
     - \( r_5 = 0 \) gives \( n \equiv 35 \mod 60 \)
     - \( r_5 = 4 \) gives \( n \equiv 59 \mod 60 \)

Thus, the solutions are \( n \equiv 35, 58, 59 \mod 60 \).

### Counting Solutions:
- Each period of 60 numbers contributes 3 solutions.
- For numbers less than 1000, we have 16 full periods (960 numbers) contributing \( 16 \times 3 = 48 \) solutions.
- In the remaining 39 numbers (961-999), only 995 is a solution.

Total number of solutions: \( 48 + 1 = 49 \).

Thus, the number of extra-distinct positive integers less than 1000 is \(\boxed{49}\).
