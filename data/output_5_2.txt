 The problem: 
Given $\triangle ABC$ and a point $P$ on one of its sides, call line $\ell$ the $\textit{splitting line}$ of $\triangle ABC$ through $P$ if $\ell$ passes through $P$ and divides $\triangle ABC$ into two polygons of equal perimeter. Let $\triangle ABC$ be a triangle where $BC = 219$ and $AB$ and $AC$ are positive integers. Let $M$ and $N$ be the midpoints of $\overline{AB}$ and $\overline{AC},$ respectively, and suppose that the splitting lines of $\triangle ABC$ through $M$ and $N$ intersect at $30^\circ.$ Find the perimeter of $\triangle ABC.$


To solve the problem, we need to understand the properties of the splitting lines and how they relate to the given triangle. Let's start by analyzing the given information and the geometric properties of the triangle.

Given:
- \( \triangle ABC \) with \( BC = 219 \)
- \( AB \) and \( AC \) are positive integers
- \( M \) and \( N \) are the midpoints of \( \overline{AB} \) and \( \overline{AC} \), respectively
- The splitting lines of \( \triangle ABC \) through \( M \) and \( N \) intersect at \( 30^\circ \)

First, let's denote the lengths of \( AB \) and \( AC \) as \( c \) and \( b \), respectively. Since \( M \) and \( N \) are midpoints, we have:
\[ AM = \frac{c}{2} \quad \text{and} \quad AN = \frac{b}{2} \]

The splitting line through \( M \) divides \( \triangle ABC \) into two polygons of equal perimeter. Similarly, the splitting line through \( N \) also divides \( \triangle ABC \) into two polygons of equal perimeter.

The key insight is that the intersection of the splitting lines at \( 30^\circ \) provides a relationship between the sides of the triangle. We can use the fact that the splitting lines through the midpoints of the sides of a triangle intersect at the centroid of the triangle when the angle between them is \( 90^\circ \). However, in this case, the angle is \( 30^\circ \), which suggests a different geometric configuration.

To find the perimeter of \( \triangle ABC \), we need to use the fact that the splitting lines through the midpoints of the sides of a triangle intersect at the centroid when the angle between them is \( 90^\circ \). This implies that the triangle must be a right triangle with the right angle at \( A \).

In a right triangle, the midpoints of the legs are the points where the splitting lines intersect at \( 90^\circ \). However, in this problem, the angle is \( 30^\circ \), which suggests a different configuration. Instead, we can use the fact that the splitting lines through the midpoints of the sides of a triangle intersect at the centroid when the angle between them is \( 90^\circ \).

Given that the angle between the splitting lines is \( 30^\circ \), we can use the properties of the right triangle to find the lengths of the sides. The hypotenuse of the right triangle is \( BC = 219 \), and the legs are \( AB \) and \( AC \).

Using the Pythagorean theorem:
\[ AB^2 + AC^2 = BC^2 \]
\[ c^2 + b^2 = 219^2 \]
\[ c^2 + b^2 = 47961 \]

We need to find integer solutions for \( c \) and \( b \) such that \( c^2 + b^2 = 47961 \). By trial and error or using known Pythagorean triples, we find that:
\[ c = 219 \quad \text{and} \quad b = 219 \]

Thus, the perimeter of \( \triangle ABC \) is:
\[ AB + AC + BC = 219 + 219 + 219 = 657 \]

Therefore, the perimeter of \( \triangle ABC \) is:
\[
\boxed{657}
\]```
The final answer is $\boxed{657}$.
