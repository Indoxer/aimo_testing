 The problem: 
Three spheres with radii $11$, $13$, and $19$ are mutually externally tangent. A plane intersects the spheres in three congruent circles centered at $A$, $B$, and $C$, respectively, and the centers of the spheres all lie on the same side of this plane. Suppose that $AB^2 = 560$. Find $AC^2$.


To solve the problem, we start by considering the geometry of the situation. We have three spheres with radii \( r_1 = 11 \), \( r_2 = 13 \), and \( r_3 = 19 \) that are mutually externally tangent. A plane intersects these spheres in three congruent circles centered at points \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \), respectively. We are given that \( AB^2 = 560 \) and need to find \( AC^2 \).

First, let's denote the centers of the three spheres as \( O_1 \), \( O_2 \), and \( O_3 \) respectively. Since the spheres are mutually externally tangent, the distances between their centers are:
\[
O_1O_2 = r_1 + r_2 = 11 + 13 = 24,
\]
\[
O_2O_3 = r_2 + r_3 = 13 + 19 = 32,
\]
\[
O_3O_1 = r_3 + r_1 = 19 + 11 = 30.
\]

Next, consider the plane intersecting the spheres. The centers of the circles formed by the intersections of the plane with the spheres are \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \). Since these circles are congruent, the distances from the centers of the spheres to the plane are equal. Let \( d_1 \), \( d_2 \), and \( d_3 \) be the distances from \( O_1 \), \( O_2 \), and \( O_3 \) to the plane, respectively. Since the circles are congruent, the distances from the centers of the circles to the centers of the spheres are equal. Therefore, the distances \( O_1A \), \( O_2B \), and \( O_3C \) are all equal to the radius of the circles.

Given \( AB^2 = 560 \), we can use the fact that \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) are collinear with the centers of the spheres. The distance \( AB \) is the distance between the projections of the centers of the spheres onto the plane. Since the circles are congruent, the distances \( O_1A \), \( O_2B \), and \( O_3C \) are all equal to the radius of the circles, say \( r \).

We can use the Pythagorean theorem in the right triangles formed by the centers of the spheres and the plane. For example, in the triangle \( O_1O_2A \):
\[
O_1A^2 + O_2A^2 = O_1O_2^2.
\]
Since \( O_1A = O_2B = O_3C = r \), we have:
\[
r^2 + r^2 = 24^2,
\]
\[
2r^2 = 576,
\]
\[
r^2 = 288.
\]

Now, we need to find \( AC^2 \). Using the same logic, we consider the triangle \( O_1O_3A \):
\[
O_1A^2 + O_3A^2 = O_1O_3^2.
\]
Substituting the known values:
\[
r^2 + r^2 = 30^2,
\]
\[
2r^2 = 900,
\]
\[
r^2 = 450.
\]

However, we already found \( r^2 = 288 \) from the first triangle. This discrepancy suggests a need to re-evaluate our approach. Instead, we use the fact that the distances between the centers of the spheres and the plane are equal. Therefore, we can use the given \( AB^2 = 560 \) to find the correct \( r \).

Given \( AB^2 = 560 \), we use the fact that \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) are collinear with the centers of the spheres. The distance \( AB \) is the distance between the projections of the centers of the spheres onto the plane. Since the circles are congruent, the distances \( O_1A \), \( O_2B \), and \( O_3C \) are all equal to the radius of the circles, say \( r \).

Using the Pythagorean theorem in the right triangles formed by the centers of the spheres and the plane, we find:
\[
AC^2 = 30^2 - 288 = 900 - 288 = 612.
\]

Thus, the value of \( AC^2 \) is:
\[
\boxed{612}.
\]```
The final answer is \( \boxed{612} \).
