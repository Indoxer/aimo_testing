 The problem: 
Five men and nine women stand equally spaced around a circle in random order. The probability that every man stands diametrically opposite a woman is $\frac{m}{n},$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n.$


Okay, so I need to find the probability that every man stands diametrically opposite a woman when five men and nine women are standing equally spaced around a circle in random order. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, let me visualize the scenario. There's a circle with 14 people (5 men + 9 women) standing equally spaced. Each person has someone directly opposite them since 14 is an even number. So, each position has a unique diametrically opposite position.

The problem states that we want the probability that every man is standing opposite a woman. That means for each of the five men, their diametrically opposite spot must be occupied by a woman. 

Let me think about how to approach this. Probability is usually favorable outcomes divided by total possible outcomes. So, I need to figure out two things:

1. The total number of ways to arrange the 14 people around the circle.
2. The number of favorable arrangements where each man is opposite a woman.

Starting with the total number of arrangements. Since it's a circle, the number of distinct arrangements is usually (n-1)! because rotations are considered the same. But wait, in this case, are the positions labeled? The problem says they stand in random order, but doesn't specify if rotations count as different or not. Hmm, sometimes in circular arrangements, we fix one person's position to account for rotational symmetry. Let me check.

If we fix one person's position, say a woman, then we have 13! ways to arrange the remaining 13 people. Alternatively, if we don't fix any position, it's 14! because all positions are distinct. Wait, but in circular permutations, fixing one position accounts for rotations being equivalent. So maybe the total number is 13!.

But hold on, the problem didn't specify whether rotations are considered the same or not. It just says "random order." Hmm, perhaps in combinatorics problems involving circles, unless specified otherwise, arrangements are considered up to rotation, meaning we can fix one position to calculate the total number of distinct arrangements. So, maybe 13! is correct for total arrangements.

Wait, actually, no. In most cases where you have distinguishable people, you consider the total number of circular arrangements as (n-1)! because rotating the entire circle doesn't create a new arrangement. However, if the circle isn't labeled, just fixed in space, then each rotation is a different arrangement. But in this problem, since the people are standing in random order, probably we should consider all linear arrangements as distinct, but since it's a circle, some symmetries apply.

Hmm, maybe it's better to fix one person's position to avoid overcounting due to rotations. So, fix a specific person, say a woman, at a certain spot, and then arrange the remaining 13 people. That way, the total number of arrangements is 13!.

So, total number of possible arrangements is 13!.

Now, moving on to favorable outcomes. We need arrangements where every man is opposite a woman. Let's think about how to count these.

Since there are 14 positions, each man must have a woman opposite him. There are 5 men, so we need 5 women to be placed opposite the men. The remaining 4 women will be placed somewhere else.

But wait, if we place a woman opposite each man, those women cannot be opposite another man. So, effectively, we're pairing each man with a woman. Since the circle has 14 positions, each man occupies a position and requires a woman in the diametrically opposite position.

Let me try to model this. Imagine the circle divided into 7 pairs of diametrically opposite positions. Each pair consists of two spots opposite each other. For our purposes, each such pair is independent of the others except for the fact that we can't have overlapping pairs.

We have 5 men who need to be placed in such a way that each has a woman opposite them. So, we need to choose 5 pairs out of the 7 available pairs where each chosen pair will have a man in one position and a woman in the opposite position.

Once we've selected these 5 pairs, we can place the men and women accordingly. Then, the remaining 4 pairs will have both women.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of selecting positions for the men. Since each man must have a woman opposite, we can think of each man as occupying a position and forcing a woman into the opposite position. So, if we choose 5 positions for the men, then their opposites must be women. However, we have to ensure that none of the men are opposite each other, which would cause a conflict because the opposite of a man must be a woman.

Therefore, the key is to select 5 positions for the men such that none of these positions are diametrically opposite each other. Once these 5 positions are chosen, their opposite positions must be occupied by women, and the remaining positions can be filled with the remaining people.

So, step by step:

1. Fix one position to eliminate rotational symmetry. Let's fix a specific position; say, position 1 is fixed. Then, we need to arrange the remaining 13 people. Wait, but earlier we considered fixing one person to get 13! total arrangements. Maybe that's complicating things. Alternatively, if we don't fix any position, the total number is 14!.

But now, thinking again, perhaps fixing a position is necessary to avoid overcounting. Let me clarify. If we fix one person's position, say a woman, then the rest can be arranged in 13! ways. This is because in circular permutations, fixing one position removes the rotational symmetry.

Given that, let's fix one woman's position. Now, among the remaining 13 positions, we need to arrange 5 men and 8 women such that each man is opposite a woman.

So, now, the problem reduces to arranging 5 men and 8 women in 13 positions with the condition that each man is opposite a woman.

But wait, in a circle of 14, after fixing one position, the diametrically opposite positions are determined. So, for each of the 7 pairs (since 14/2=7), one position is fixed relative to the fixed woman.

Wait, no. If we fix one position, say position 1, then its opposite is position 8 (assuming positions are numbered 1 through 14). Similarly, position 2 is opposite position 9, position 3 opposite position 10, etc.

So, fixing position 1, which is a woman, its opposite is position 8. Now, for the remaining 13 positions, we need to arrange 5 men and 8 women such that each man is not in a position that's opposite another man, and each man's opposite is a woman.

So, the key here is that the 5 men must occupy positions such that none are opposite each other, and their opposites are women.

So, considering that, how do we count the number of favorable arrangements?

First, note that there are 7 pairs of diametrically opposite positions. One of these pairs includes the fixed position 1 and its opposite position 8. Since position 1 is already occupied by a woman, position 8 must be a woman as well. Therefore, neither position 1 nor position 8 can contain a man. Thus, the remaining 6 pairs (positions 2-14 excluding 1 and 8) must accommodate the 5 men and 8 women.

But wait, actually, position 1 is fixed as a woman, so the other 13 positions include 5 men and 8 women. So, the 13 positions consist of 5 men and 8 women, and we need to arrange them such that each man is opposite a woman.

Each of the 7 pairs (including the fixed pair 1-8) must satisfy that if a pair contains a man, the other end must contain a woman. But since position 1 is fixed as a woman, position 8 must also be a woman. So, in the pair containing position 1 and 8, both are women. Therefore, the other 6 pairs can have either two women, a man and a woman, but not two men.

Wait, actually, since each man needs to be opposite a woman, each man must be in a unique pair where the other member is a woman. So, for the 5 men, they must be in 5 different pairs, each paired with a woman.

But we have 6 pairs left (excluding the fixed pair 1-8). So, we can choose 5 out of these 6 pairs to place the men, each in one position, and their opposite will automatically be women. Then, the remaining 1 pair will have both women.

But let's formalize this:

Total pairs: 7

Fixed pair: 1-8 (both women)

Remaining pairs: 6

We need to choose 5 of these 6 pairs to place a man in one position and a woman in the opposite. Then, in the remaining 1 pair, we'll have 2 women.

Additionally, for each chosen pair, we can decide whether the man is in position i or position j (the two ends of the pair). So, for each of the 5 pairs, there are 2 choices for placing the man.

Moreover, once we've assigned the men and women to their respective positions, we still have to assign the specific men and women to those spots.

Wait, perhaps it's better to structure this as follows:

1. Choose 5 pairs out of the 6 remaining pairs to place the men. The number of ways to choose these pairs is C(6,5).

2. For each chosen pair, decide which side of the pair the man will be placed. Since each pair has two positions, and we can independently choose for each pair, the number of ways is 2^5.

3. Assign the 5 men to the 5 chosen positions. The number of ways is 5!.

4. Assign the 8 women to the remaining 8 positions (including the fixed position 1 and the opposite positions of the men). The number of ways is 8!.

However, wait, let's verify this step by step.

First, fix position 1 as a woman. Then, we have 13 positions left, with 5 men and 8 women.

We need to place the 5 men in such a way that each is in a unique pair, and their opposite is a woman.

There are 6 remaining pairs (excluding the fixed pair). We need to choose 5 pairs from these 6 to place the men.

Number of ways to choose 5 pairs: C(6,5) = 6.

For each chosen pair, we can place the man in either of the two positions. So, for each pair, 2 options, hence 2^5 = 32 ways.

Then, once the positions for the men are chosen, we can assign the 5 men to those positions. That's 5! ways.

Similarly, the women can be assigned to the remaining positions (which are 13 - 5 = 8 positions). Since position 1 is fixed, we have 8 women to assign to 8 positions, so 8! ways.

Therefore, the total number of favorable arrangements is:

C(6,5) * 2^5 * 5! * 8!

Simplify that:

C(6,5) = 6

2^5 = 32

5! = 120

8! = 40320

Multiply them together: 6 * 32 * 120 * 40320

Compute step by step:

6 * 32 = 192

192 * 120 = 23040

23040 * 40320 = Let's compute this:

First, note that 23040 * 40320

Breakdown:

23040 * 40320 = 23040 * (4 * 10080) = 23040 * 4 * 10080

23040 * 4 = 92160

92160 * 10080

Wait, this is getting too big. Maybe we can keep it symbolic for now.

But actually, remember that the total number of favorable arrangements is 6 * 32 * 120 * 40320.

But wait, before computing the actual numbers, let's recall that the total number of arrangements is 13! (since we fixed one position, making the total arrangements 13!).

Therefore, the probability is [6 * 32 * 120 * 40320] / 13!

Simplify numerator:

Compute numerator step by step:

6 * 32 = 192

192 * 120 = 23040

23040 * 40320

Let me write 23040 as 2304 * 10 and 40320 as 4032 * 10.

So, 2304 * 4032 * 100

Compute 2304 * 4032:

Note that 2304 * 4032 = ?

Well, 2304 * 4000 = 9,216,000

2304 * 32 = 73,728

Add them together: 9,216,000 + 73,728 = 9,289,728

Multiply by 100: 928,972,800

So, numerator is 928,972,800

Denominator is 13! = 6,227,020,800

Thus, probability is 928,972,800 / 6,227,020,800

Simplify this fraction.

Divide numerator and denominator by 928,972,800:

Numerator becomes 1

Denominator becomes 6,227,020,800 / 928,972,800

Calculate that division:

6,227,020,800 ÷ 928,972,800

First, divide numerator and denominator by 100: 62,270,208 ÷ 9,289,728

Again, divide numerator and denominator by 96: 62,270,208 ÷ 96 = 648,460.333... Hmm, not helpful.

Alternatively, factor both numbers.

But perhaps notice that 928,972,800 * 6 = 5,573,836,800, which is less than 6,227,020,800.

Wait, 928,972,800 * 6 = 5,573,836,800

Difference: 6,227,020,800 - 5,573,836,800 = 653,184,000

So, 6 + 653,184,000 / 928,972,800 ≈ 6.7

Wait, alternatively, perhaps compute GCD of numerator and denominator.

Compute GCD(928,972,800, 6,227,020,800)

Use Euclidean algorithm:

GCD(6,227,020,800, 928,972,800)

Compute 6,227,020,800 ÷ 928,972,800 = 6 times with remainder:

928,972,800 * 6 = 5,573,836,800

Subtract: 6,227,020,800 - 5,573,836,800 = 653,184,000

Now, GCD(928,972,800, 653,184,000)

Compute 928,972,800 ÷ 653,184,000 = 1 time with remainder:

653,184,000 * 1 = 653,184,000

Subtract: 928,972,800 - 653,184,000 = 275,788,800

GCD(653,184,000, 275,788,800)

Compute 653,184,000 ÷ 275,788,800 = 2 times with remainder:

275,788,800 * 2 = 551,577,600

Subtract: 653,184,000 - 551,577,600 = 101,606,400

GCD(275,788,800, 101,606,400)

Compute 275,788,800 ÷ 101,606,400 = 2 times with remainder:

101,606,400 * 2 = 203,212,800

Subtract: 275,788,800 - 203,212,800 = 72,576,000

GCD(101,606,400, 72,576,000)

Compute 101,606,400 ÷ 72,576,000 = 1 time with remainder:

72,576,000 * 1 = 72,576,000

Subtract: 101,606,400 - 72,576,000 = 29,030,400

GCD(72,576,000, 29,030,400)

Compute 72,576,000 ÷ 29,030,400 = 2 times with remainder:

29,030,400 * 2 = 58,060,800

Subtract: 72,576,000 - 58,060,800 = 14,515,200

GCD(29,030,400, 14,515,200)

Compute 29,030,400 ÷ 14,515,200 = 2 times with remainder:

14,515,200 * 2 = 29,030,400

Subtract: 29,030,400 - 29,030,400 = 0

So, GCD is 14,515,200

Therefore, divide numerator and denominator by 14,515,200:

Numerator: 928,972,800 ÷ 14,515,200 = 64

Denominator: 6,227,020,800 ÷ 14,515,200 = 429

So, simplified fraction is 64/429.

Check if 64 and 429 are coprime. Prime factors of 64: 2^6. Prime factors of 429: 429 ÷ 3 = 143; 143 ÷ 11 = 13. So, 429 = 3*11*13. No common factors with 64, so yes, reduced form is 64/429.

Therefore, the probability is 64/429.

Hence, m = 64, n = 429. Check if they are coprime: As above, yes. So, m + n = 64 + 429 = 493.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{493}
</think>

To find the probability that every man stands diametrically opposite a woman when five men and nine women are standing equally spaced around a circle in random order, we start by considering the total number of arrangements and the number of favorable arrangements.

1. **Total Number of Arrangements**:
   - Since we fix one position to account for rotational symmetry, the total number of distinct arrangements is \(13!\).

2. **Favorable Arrangements**:
   - We need to place 5 men such that each is opposite a woman. There are 7 pairs of diametrically opposite positions. One pair includes the fixed position (a woman) and its opposite. The remaining 6 pairs must accommodate the 5 men and 8 women.
   - Choose 5 out of the 6 remaining pairs to place the men: \( \binom{6}{5} = 6 \).
   - For each chosen pair, decide which side the man will be placed: \(2^5 = 32\).
   - Assign the 5 men to the chosen positions: \(5!\).
   - Assign the 8 women to the remaining positions: \(8!\).

   Therefore, the number of favorable arrangements is:
   \[
   \binom{6}{5} \times 2^5 \times 5! \times 8! = 6 \times 32 \times 120 \times 40320
   \]

3. **Probability Calculation**:
   - The probability is the ratio of favorable arrangements to the total number of arrangements:
   \[
   \frac{6 \times 32 \times 120 \times 40320}{13!}
   \]
   - Simplify the fraction:
     - Numerator: \(6 \times 32 \times 120 \times 40320 = 928972800\)
     - Denominator: \(13! = 6227020800\)
     - Compute GCD and simplify: The fraction simplifies to \(\frac{64}{429}\).

Thus, the probability is \(\frac{64}{429}\), and the sum of \(m\) and \(n\) is \(64 + 429 = 493\).

\[
\boxed{493}
\]
