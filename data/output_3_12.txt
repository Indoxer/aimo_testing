 The problem: 
For any finite set $X$, let $| X |$ denote the number of elements in $X$. Define
\[S_n = \sum | A \cap B | ,\]
where the sum is taken over all ordered pairs $(A, B)$ such that $A$ and $B$ are subsets of $\left\{ 1 , 2 , 3,  \cdots , n \right\}$ with $|A| = |B|$.
For example, $S_2 = 4$ because the sum is taken over the pairs of subsets
\[(A, B) \in \left\{ (\emptyset, \emptyset) , ( \{1\} , \{1\} ), ( \{1\} , \{2\} ) , ( \{2\} , \{1\} ) , ( \{2\} , \{2\} ) , ( \{1 , 2\} , \{1 , 2\} ) \right\} ,\]
giving $S_2 = 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 2 = 4$.
Let $\frac{S_{2022}}{S_{2021}} = \frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find the remainder when $p + q$ is divided by
1000.


To solve for \( S_n \), we need to understand the sum of the sizes of the intersections of all pairs of subsets of \(\{1, 2, \ldots, n\}\) with the same size. Let's start by considering the contribution of each element \( i \) in the set \(\{1, 2, \ldots, n\}\) to the sum \( S_n \).

For a fixed element \( i \), we need to count how many times it appears in the intersection of two subsets \( A \) and \( B \) of the same size. If \( A \) and \( B \) are subsets of \(\{1, 2, \ldots, n\}\) with \( |A| = |B| = k \), then the number of such pairs \((A, B)\) where \( i \in A \cap B \) is given by choosing \( k-1 \) elements from the remaining \( n-1 \) elements to form \( A \) and \( B \). The number of ways to choose these elements is \(\binom{n-1}{k-1}^2\).

Thus, the total contribution of element \( i \) to \( S_n \) is:
\[
\sum_{k=1}^n \binom{n-1}{k-1}^2 = \sum_{j=0}^{n-1} \binom{n-1}{j}^2 = \binom{2(n-1)}{n-1}.
\]
This is because the sum of the squares of binomial coefficients is given by the central binomial coefficient of twice the upper index.

Therefore, the total sum \( S_n \) is:
\[
S_n = n \binom{2(n-1)}{n-1}.
\]

Now, we need to find \( S_{2022} \) and \( S_{2021} \):
\[
S_{2022} = 2022 \binom{2022 \cdot 2021}{2021},
\]
\[
S_{2021} = 2021 \binom{2021 \cdot 2020}{2020}.
\]

We need to find the ratio \( \frac{S_{2022}}{S_{2021}} \):
\[
\frac{S_{2022}}{S_{2021}} = \frac{2022 \binom{2022 \cdot 2021}{2021}}{2021 \binom{2021 \cdot 2020}{2020}} = \frac{2022}{2021} \cdot \frac{\binom{2022 \cdot 2021}{2021}}{\binom{2021 \cdot 2020}{2020}}.
\]

Using the property of binomial coefficients, we have:
\[
\binom{2022 \cdot 2021}{2021} = \frac{(2022 \cdot 2021)!}{2021! (2022 \cdot 2021 - 2021)!} = \frac{(2022 \cdot 2021)!}{2021! (2021 \cdot 2020)!},
\]
\[
\binom{2021 \cdot 2020}{2020} = \frac{(2021 \cdot 2020)!}{2020! (2021 \cdot 2020 - 2020)!} = \frac{(2021 \cdot 2020)!}{2020! (2020 \cdot 2019)!}.
\]

Thus,
\[
\frac{\binom{2022 \cdot 2021}{2021}}{\binom{2021 \cdot 2020}{2020}} = \frac{(2022 \cdot 2021)! / (2021! (2021 \cdot 2020)!)}{(2021 \cdot 2020)! / (2020! (2020 \cdot 2019)!)} = \frac{(2022 \cdot 2021)!}{2021! (2021 \cdot 2020)!} \cdot \frac{2020! (2020 \cdot 2019)!}{(2021 \cdot 2020)!} = \frac{2022 \cdot 2021}{2021} = 2022.
\]

So,
\[
\frac{S_{2022}}{S_{2021}} = \frac{2022}{2021} \cdot 2022 = \frac{2022^2}{2021}.
\]

The fraction \(\frac{2022^2}{2021}\) is already in its simplest form because 2022 and 2021 are consecutive integers and thus coprime. Therefore, \( p = 2022^2 \) and \( q = 2021 \).

Finally, we need to find the remainder when \( p + q = 2022^2 + 2021 \) is divided by 1000. First, calculate \( 2022^2 \mod 1000 \):
\[
2022^2 = (2000 + 22)^2 = 2000^2 + 2 \cdot 2000 \cdot 22 + 22^2 = 4000000 + 88000 + 484 = 4088484,
\]
\[
4088484 \mod 1000 = 484.
\]

Then,
\[
2022^2 + 2021 \equiv 484 + 2021 \equiv 2505 \equiv 505 \pmod{1000}.
\]

Thus, the remainder when \( p + q \) is divided by 1000 is \(\boxed{505}\).
