 The problem: 
Let $S$ be the set of all rational numbers that can be expressed as a repeating decimal in the form $0.\overline{abcd},$ where at least one of the digits $a,$ $b,$ $c,$ or $d$ is nonzero. Let $N$ be the number of distinct numerators obtained when numbers in $S$ are written as fractions in lowest terms. For example, both $4$ and $410$ are counted among the distinct numerators for numbers in $S$ because $0.\overline{3636} = \frac{4}{11}$ and $0.\overline{1230} = \frac{410}{3333}.$ Find the remainder when $N$ is divided by $1000.$


To solve the problem, we first need to understand the structure of the repeating decimals in the set \( S \). A number in the form \( 0.\overline{abcd} \) can be expressed as a fraction. Specifically, if \( x = 0.\overline{abcd} \), then

\[
x = \frac{abcd}{9999},
\]

where \( abcd \) represents the four-digit number formed by the digits \( a, b, c, \) and \( d \). Since \( x \) is a repeating decimal with a period of 4, the denominator is 9999. We need to express \( x \) in its lowest terms, which means we need to find the greatest common divisor (gcd) of \( abcd \) and 9999 and divide both the numerator and the denominator by this gcd.

The prime factorization of 9999 is:

\[
9999 = 3^2 \times 11 \times 101.
\]

For the fraction \( \frac{abcd}{9999} \) to be in its lowest terms, \( abcd \) must not be divisible by 3, 11, or 101. We need to count the number of integers from 1 to 9999 that are not divisible by 3, 11, or 101.

Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, the number of integers from 1 to 9999 that are divisible by 3, 11, or 101 is:

\[
\left\lfloor \frac{9999}{3} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{9999}{11} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{9999}{101} \right\rfloor - \left\lfloor \frac{9999}{33} \right\rfloor - \left\lfloor \frac{9999}{303} \right\rfloor - \left\lfloor \frac{9999}{1111} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{9999}{3333} \right\rfloor.
\]

Calculating each term, we get:

\[
\left\lfloor \frac{9999}{3} \right\rfloor = 3333, \quad \left\lfloor \frac{9999}{11} \right\rfloor = 909, \quad \left\lfloor \frac{9999}{101} \right\rfloor = 99,
\]
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{9999}{33} \right\rfloor = 303, \quad \left\lfloor \frac{9999}{303} \right\rfloor = 33, \quad \left\lfloor \frac{9999}{1111} \right\rfloor = 9, \quad \left\lfloor \frac{9999}{3333} \right\rfloor = 3.
\]

So, the number of integers from 1 to 9999 that are divisible by 3, 11, or 101 is:

\[
3333 + 909 + 99 - 303 - 33 - 9 + 3 = 3996.
\]

Therefore, the number of integers from 1 to 9999 that are not divisible by 3, 11, or 101 is:

\[
9999 - 3996 = 6003.
\]

Thus, the number of distinct numerators obtained when numbers in \( S \) are written as fractions in lowest terms is 6003. The remainder when 6003 is divided by 1000 is:

\[
\boxed{003}.
\]
