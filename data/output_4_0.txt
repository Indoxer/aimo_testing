 The problem: 
Let $S$ be the set of all rational numbers that can be expressed as a repeating decimal in the form $0.\overline{abcd},$ where at least one of the digits $a,$ $b,$ $c,$ or $d$ is nonzero. Let $N$ be the number of distinct numerators obtained when numbers in $S$ are written as fractions in lowest terms. For example, both $4$ and $410$ are counted among the distinct numerators for numbers in $S$ because $0.\overline{3636} = \frac{4}{11}$ and $0.\overline{1230} = \frac{410}{3333}.$ Find the remainder when $N$ is divided by $1000.$


Alright, so I need to solve this problem where we have a set S of all rational numbers that can be expressed as a repeating decimal in the form 0.\overline{abcd}. Each of these decimals has a period of 4 digits, meaning they repeat every four places. The condition is that at least one of the digits a, b, c, or d is nonzero, which just ensures that we're considering non-zero numbers.

The goal is to find N, the number of distinct numerators when these numbers are written as fractions in their lowest terms. Then, we need to find N mod 1000.

First, let me understand what 0.\overline{abcd} represents. A repeating decimal like 0.\overline{abcd} can be written as a fraction. In general, a repeating decimal with period n can be written as the repeating part divided by (10^n - 1). So, specifically, 0.\overline{abcd} is equal to (abcd)/9999, where abcd is a four-digit number.

But wait, hold on. If a, b, c, d are digits, then abcd could be a four-digit number, but if a is zero, then it's actually a three-digit number or less. Hmm, but in the problem statement, it says "at least one of the digits a, b, c, or d is nonzero," which means that abcd can be from 0001 up to 9999, right? Because if a=0, b=0, c=0, d=0, that's 0, which isn't allowed since at least one digit must be nonzero.

So, essentially, the set S consists of all fractions of the form k/9999 where k is an integer from 1 to 9999. But not all of these fractions are necessarily in their lowest terms. Some will reduce further when divided by their greatest common divisors (GCDs) with 9999.

Therefore, to find the number of distinct numerators, we need to consider each k from 1 to 9999, compute the reduced fraction k/9999 = (k/d)/(9999/d), where d = gcd(k, 9999). The numerator in the reduced fraction is k/d. Since d varies depending on k, some numerators will repeat for different k's. Therefore, N is the number of distinct values of k/d as k ranges from 1 to 9999.

Hence, N is equal to the number of distinct numerators in the reduced forms of the fractions k/9999. This is equivalent to counting the number of integers m such that m divides k for some k coprime to 9999/d, or something like that... Wait, maybe another approach.

Alternatively, since each numerator m corresponds to a unique reduced fraction m/(9999/d), where d is gcd(k, 9999). So, each m is a multiple of k/d, but perhaps it's better to think about it in terms of the totatives.

Wait, no, perhaps more straightforward: the number of distinct numerators is equal to the number of integers m such that m is between 1 and 9999, and there exists some k such that m = k / gcd(k, 9999). So, m must divide into 9999 when multiplied by some d. Hmm, perhaps not exactly.

Wait, let's rephrase. When you have a fraction k/9999 in reduced terms, the numerator is k divided by gcd(k, 9999). So, each numerator m is equal to k / d, where d = gcd(k, 9999). Therefore, m must satisfy that m divides into k, and k is a multiple of m. Also, m and 9999/m must be coprime? Wait, let me see:

If m = k / d, then k = m * d. Since d is gcd(k, 9999), then d must also divide 9999. So, d is a divisor of 9999. Therefore, m must be such that m is coprime to 9999/d.

Wait, no, let's think again. If k = m * d, and d = gcd(k, 9999), then m and 9999/d must be coprime. Because if m had a common factor with 9999/d, say e > 1, then d*e would divide k, and since e divides 9999/d, d*e would divide 9999, contradicting the fact that d is the GCD.

Therefore, m must be coprime to 9999/d. Which implies that m must be in the multiplicative group modulo 9999/d.

Hmm, perhaps this is getting too abstract. Maybe instead, note that each numerator m is equal to k divided by its GCD with 9999. So, m must satisfy that m and 9999 share no common factors beyond 1. Wait, no, because if m is k/d, and d is a divisor of 9999, then m doesn't necessarily have to be coprime to 9999. It just has to be coprime to 9999/d.

Wait, let me test with an example. Take k = 4, so 0.\overline{3636} = 4/11. Here, d = gcd(4, 9999). Let's calculate gcd(4, 9999): 9999 divided by 4 is 2499.75, so the remainder is 3. Then gcd(4, 3) is 1. So, d = 1, so m = 4/1 = 4. Now, 4 is coprime to 9999/1 = 9999? Well, 4 and 9999 share a common factor of 1, yes, so it's coprime.

Another example: 0.\overline{1230} = 410/3333. Here, k = 410, d = gcd(410, 9999). Let's compute gcd(410, 9999). 9999 ÷ 410 is approximately 24.387. 410 × 24 = 9840. Subtracting, 9999 - 9840 = 159. Now, gcd(410, 159). 410 ÷ 159 ≈ 2.58. 159 × 2 = 318. Subtract, 410 - 318 = 92. gcd(159, 92). 159 ÷ 92 = 1 with remainder 67. gcd(92, 67). 92 ÷ 67 = 1 with remainder 25. gcd(67,25). 67 ÷25=2 r.17. gcd(25,17)=1. So, d=1. Hence, m = 410/1 = 410. So, 410 is the numerator in reduced form.

But 410 and 9999 are not coprime? Wait, 410 is 2 × 5 × 41, while 9999 is 9999 = 9×1111 = 9×101×11, so no overlap. Thus, m is coprime to 9999.

Wait, but earlier, when k was 4, m was 4, which is also coprime to 9999. Is this always the case?

Yes, because d = gcd(k, 9999). So, when you write m = k/d, then m must be coprime to 9999/d because any common divisor of m and 9999/d would imply that d wasn't the greatest common divisor. Therefore, m must be coprime to 9999/d, which implies that m and 9999 are coprime if d = 1.

Wait, no, not necessarily. Let me think. If m is coprime to 9999/d, then m and 9999/d share no common factors. However, 9999 is equal to d times (9999/d). So, m being coprime to 9999/d doesn't necessarily mean it's coprime to 9999, unless d = 1.

Wait, perhaps another angle. Since d = gcd(k, 9999), m = k/d is an integer, and m is coprime to 9999/d because if they shared a common divisor greater than 1, then d wouldn't be the GCD of k and 9999. So, m and 9999/d are coprime.

Thus, the set of numerators m is exactly the set of integers m such that m is coprime to 9999/d, where d is a divisor of 9999. Hmm, but how does this help us count them?

Wait, perhaps instead, since m must be such that m divides into some k, where k is from 1 to 9999, and m = k / d, where d = gcd(k, 9999). So, m can be any positive integer such that m divides k, and d divides 9999.

Alternatively, m must be a divisor of 9999/d, but I'm getting confused here.

Wait, maybe it's helpful to consider that each numerator m is equal to k / d, where d is a divisor of 9999, and k runs through multiples of d up to 9999. But no, k can be any number from 1 to 9999, so m can be any number such that m divides k and d divides 9999.

This seems complicated. Maybe another way. Since the denominators after reduction are 9999/d, where d is a divisor of 9999, and numerators are m = k/d, where m is coprime to 9999/d.

Therefore, for each divisor d of 9999, the numerators m are the numbers coprime to 9999/d, scaled by d. Wait, no, because m = k/d, and k is a multiple of d, so m can be any integer from 1 to 9999/d. But m must be coprime to 9999/d.

Wait, so for each divisor d of 9999, the numerators m are the numbers from 1 to 9999/d that are coprime to 9999/d. So, the number of numerators contributed by each d is φ(9999/d), Euler's totient function.

But wait, hold on. If m must be coprime to 9999/d, then for each d dividing 9999, the number of possible m's is φ(9999/d). But m also needs to satisfy that m ≤ 9999/k? Wait, no.

Wait, perhaps not. Since m = k/d, and k ≤ 9999, so m ≤ 9999/d. So, m ranges over integers from 1 to 9999/d that are coprime to 9999/d.

Therefore, for each divisor d of 9999, we get φ(9999/d) numerators. However, we must ensure that we don't double-count numerators from different d's.

Wait, but each numerator m is uniquely determined by d, since m = k/d, and d is the GCD(k, 9999). So, for each m, it comes from exactly one d, namely d = gcd(k, 9999). Therefore, the total number of distinct numerators is the sum over all divisors d of 9999 of φ(9999/d).

But wait, no, that would be the case if every m is counted once, but in reality, when we do the sum over d | 9999 of φ(9999/d), we get the total number of integers less than or equal to 9999 that are coprime to 9999. But that's not correct because we're summing φ(n) over all divisors, which actually equals n. Wait, yes! There's a theorem that says that the sum_{d|n} φ(d) = n. So, sum_{d|n} φ(d) = n.

In our case, n is 9999, so sum_{d|9999} φ(d) = 9999. But wait, in our previous reasoning, we were thinking of sum_{d|9999} φ(9999/d). But since d runs over all divisors of 9999, so does 9999/d. So, sum_{d|9999} φ(9999/d) = sum_{d|9999} φ(d) = 9999.

But that suggests that the total number of numerators would be 9999, which can't be true because many fractions k/9999 will reduce to the same numerator m. Wait, but according to our earlier logic, each m is counted once for each d, but actually, each m is unique across all d.

Wait, perhaps the confusion arises because m is a numerator in reduced form, so m must be coprime to the denominator. The denominators after reduction are 9999/d, and m must be coprime to 9999/d. Therefore, for each d, the numerators m are precisely the numbers coprime to 9999/d, which is φ(9999/d). So, the total number of numerators is the sum over all d | 9999 of φ(9999/d). As I said earlier, since d runs over all divisors, 9999/d also runs over all divisors, so the sum is equal to sum_{d | 9999} φ(d) = 9999.

But that would imply that the number of distinct numerators is 9999, but that can't be right because, for example, 0.\overline{0000} is 0, which is excluded, and other numbers would have numerators that are factors of 9999.

Wait, no, 9999 is the denominator before reduction. After reduction, the denominators become 9999/d, where d is the GCD of k and 9999, and the numerators are m = k/d, which are coprime to 9999/d.

But each m is unique across all k, so the total number of distinct numerators should indeed be 9999. But that can't be because, for example, both k=1 and k=2 would lead to m=1 and m=2 respectively, but when reduced, they might not collide with others.

Wait, no, 9999 is a large number, but numerators can range up to 9999. So, in theory, the number of distinct numerators could be 9999. But in practice, since many k's reduce to the same m, maybe the number is less.

Wait, no, because each m is uniquely determined by k and d. So, for each k, you get a unique m, but different k's can give the same m. So, for example, k=1 and k=2, if d=1, m=1 and m=2, which are different. But if two different k's lead to the same m, then N would be less than 9999.

Wait, so the key point is whether different k's can result in the same m. For example, suppose k1/d1 = k2/d2, where d1 = gcd(k1, 9999), d2 = gcd(k2, 9999). Is it possible for k1/d1 = k2/d2 even if k1 ≠ k2?

Yes, certainly. For instance, take k1 = 2 and k2 = 4. Suppose 9999 is divisible by 2 and 4. Then, d1 = gcd(2, 9999) = 1, so m1 = 2/1 = 2. d2 = gcd(4, 9999) = 1, so m2 = 4/1 = 4. These are different.

Wait, maybe another example: k1 = 3, k2 = 6. Suppose d1 = gcd(3, 9999) = 3, so m1 = 3/3 = 1. d2 = gcd(6, 9999) = 3, so m2 = 6/3 = 2. Still different.

Wait, maybe take k1 = 9 and k2 = 3. Then d1 = gcd(9, 9999) = 9, m1 = 9/9 = 1. d2 = gcd(3, 9999) = 3, m2 = 3/3 = 1. Ah, here we go: two different k's giving the same m.

So, in this case, k1=9 and k2=3 both reduce to m=1. Therefore, m=1 is counted twice, once from k=3 and once from k=9. Hence, in the count of N, m=1 is only counted once.

Therefore, N is equal to the number of distinct m's, which is equal to the number of numerators in reduced form, which is equal to the number of distinct fractions in [1, 9999] with denominator dividing 9999.

Wait, perhaps another way: the number of distinct numerators is equal to the number of fractions in the Farey sequence of order 9999, but I don't think that's directly applicable here.

Wait, stepping back, perhaps N is equal to the number of integers m such that m is between 1 and 9999, and m is coprime to 9999/d, where d is the GCD(m*d, 9999). Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, since each m is equal to k/d where d divides 9999 and k is a multiple of d, perhaps m can be any positive integer such that m divides 9999/d for some d dividing 9999.

Wait, now I'm getting confused. Maybe it's better to refer back to group theory or number theory concepts.

Wait, perhaps note that the mapping from k to m is surjective onto the set of numerators, and each m corresponds to a unique pair (d, m) where d is a divisor of 9999 and m is coprime to 9999/d. Therefore, the total number of m's is the sum over all d | 9999 of φ(9999/d). Since d runs over all divisors of 9999, and 9999/d also runs over all divisors, this sum is equal to sum_{d | 9999} φ(d) = 9999.

But that can't be, because the numerators can't exceed 9999, but they also can't be more than 9999. So, perhaps the number of distinct numerators is 9999. But that contradicts my initial thought that many k's reduce to the same m.

Wait, but in the earlier example, k=3 and k=9 both reduce to m=1, so m=1 is counted twice. So, how come the total count is still 9999? No, actually, the sum over d | 9999 of φ(9999/d) counts each m exactly once because each m is associated with exactly one d.

Wait, yes, because for each m, m must be coprime to 9999/d where d is the GCD(k, 9999). So, each m is counted exactly once in the sum. Therefore, the total number of numerators N is equal to 9999.

But that can't be correct because 0.\overline{0000} is 0, which is excluded, and other numbers may have overlapping numerators.

Wait, no, actually, since k ranges from 1 to 9999, m ranges from 1 to 9999, and each m is achieved by exactly one k/d. So, N is 9999. But that seems too high.

Wait, let's take a small example to verify. Let’s say instead of 9999, we use 9. So, 0.\overline{abcd} becomes 0.\overline{wxyz} but in this case, let's make it 0.\overline{ab} with period 2.

So, similar problem: set S' consists of numbers 0.\overline{ab} where a and b are digits, not both zero. Then, each number is equal to (10a + b)/99. The reduced fractions will have numerators ranging from 1 to 99, but only those co-prime to 99/d where d is GCD(10a + b, 99).

Wait, in this smaller case, the number of distinct numerators would be sum_{d | 99} φ(99/d). Since 99 = 9*11, its divisors are 1, 3, 9, 11, 33, 99.

Compute sum_{d | 99} φ(99/d):

For d=1: φ(99) = φ(9*11) = φ(9)*φ(11) = 6*10 = 60

d=3: φ(33) = φ(3*11) = 2*10=20

d=9: φ(11)=10

d=11: φ(9)=6

d=33: φ(3)=2

d=99: φ(1)=1

Adding them up: 60 + 20 + 10 + 6 + 2 +1= 99. So, N=99 in this case, which is the same as the original k=99.

But in reality, how many distinct numerators do we have?

Each k from 1 to 99 reduces to k/d, where d=GCD(k,99). The numerators are k/d, which are numbers from 1 to 99, but some are repeated.

For example, k=3: d=3, m=1; k=6: d=3, m=2; k=9: d=9, m=1; etc.

Wait, so in reality, the numerators can only be numbers coprime to 99/d. But in this small example, we end up with N=99, which is correct because each numerator is unique when you consider the entire set. But in reality, in the reduced fractions, some numerators repeat.

Wait, no, in the small example, the fractions are (10a + b)/99 reduced. So, for example, 0.\overline{01}=1/99, 0.\overline{02}=2/99,..., 0.\overline{11}=11/99=1/9, which is a reduced fraction with numerator 1, same as 0.\overline{10}=10/99. So, in this case, the numerators are 1, 2, ..., 99, but when reduced, some numerators coincide.

Wait, in this small example, when you reduce 11/99, you get 1/9, so numerator 1 is achieved by both 1/99 and 11/99. Similarly, 22/99 reduces to 2/9, so numerator 2 is achieved by both 2/99 and 22/99. So, actually, numerators are fewer than 99.

Therefore, my previous conclusion that N=9999 is incorrect because in reality, some numerators coincide, so N is less than 9999.

So, where did I go wrong? It seems that the sum over d | n of φ(n/d) gives the total number of integers less than or equal to n that are coprime to n/d for each d, but in reality, the numerators are not unique because different k's can lead to the same m.

Wait, but in the small example, the sum over d | 99 of φ(99/d) equals 99, but the actual number of distinct numerators is less.

Therefore, my earlier assumption is flawed.

Perhaps another approach: since each numerator m must satisfy m <= 9999/d, where d is a divisor of 9999, and m is coprime to 9999/d. So, for each d, the number of m's is φ(9999/d). But the total number of numerators is the sum over d | 9999 of φ(9999/d), but as shown in the small example, this leads to overcounting because different d's can produce the same m.

Wait, no, in the small example, the sum over d | 99 of φ(99/d) was 99, but in reality, the number of distinct numerators was less. So, clearly, that approach is not correct.

Alternative idea: think of the numerators as numbers m where m and 9999 share a common factor d, such that m = k/d and k is from 1 to 9999.

But m must be coprime to 9999/d because d is the GCD. So, each m is in the set {1, 2, ..., 9999} such that m is coprime to 9999/d for some d | 9999.

Wait, but m can be anything as long as it's coprime to 9999/d for some d.

Alternatively, perhaps the numerators are all numbers that are coprime to some divisor of 9999.

But 9999 factors into prime factors as 9999 = 9 × 1111 = 9 × 101 × 11. So, 9999 = 3² × 11 × 101.

Thus, the divisors of 9999 are generated by exponents of primes: 3^0, 3^1, 3^2; 11^0, 11^1; 101^0, 101^1. So, total of 3×2×2=12 divisors.

So, the divisors are:

1, 3, 9, 11, 33, 99, 101, 303, 909, 1111, 3333, 9999.

Now, for each divisor d of 9999, the numerators m are the numbers from 1 to 9999/d that are coprime to 9999/d.

Thus, the number of numerators contributed by each d is φ(9999/d). But again, adding up φ(9999/d) over all d would give 9999, but as we saw, in the small example, this is incorrect because of overlapping numerators.

Wait, but in the small example, when n=99, sum_{d|99} φ(99/d)=99, but in reality, the number of distinct numerators is 60, which is φ(99). So, that approach doesn't work either.

I think I'm stuck here. Maybe I need a different strategy.

Let me recall that in the problem, we are dealing with numbers of the form 0.\overline{abcd}, which is 0.\overline{wxyz}, but in this case, period 4. So, each such number is equal to (w*1000 + x*100 + y*10 + z)/9999.

Thus, the set S is {k/9999 | k ∈ ℕ, 1 ≤ k ≤ 9999, and k has at least one non-zero digit}.

When written in lowest terms, each fraction k/9999 becomes m/n, where m = k/d and n = 9999/d, with d = gcd(k,9999).

Therefore, the numerator m must satisfy m < n and gcd(m,n)=1.

Thus, the number of distinct numerators is equal to the number of pairs (m,n) such that n divides 9999, m < n, gcd(m,n)=1.

But wait, not exactly, because n can be any divisor of 9999, but m is bounded by 9999/d, which complicates things.

Alternatively, note that each numerator m must be an integer such that m = k/d, where d is a divisor of 9999, and k is between 1 and 9999.

But perhaps it's better to model this as the numerators m are in bijection with the numbers co-prime to 9999/d for some d.

Alternatively, perhaps the numerators correspond to numbers m where m is an integer such that m and 9999 share some common factor d, and m/d is co-prime to 9999/d.

But this seems circular.

Wait, perhaps it's helpful to think in terms of multiplicative functions.

Given that 9999 factors into 3² × 11 × 101, the number of numerators N can be calculated using inclusion-exclusion principles based on the prime factors.

Alternatively, since each numerator m is of the form k/d, where d divides 9999, and m must be co-prime to 9999/d. Therefore, m must lie in the multiplicative group modulo 9999/d.

But perhaps the number of numerators is equal to the sum over all d | 9999 of φ(9999/d). But in the small example, this gave 99, but in reality, it's less.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that in the small example, n=99, which is 9×11, but in reality, when we have fractions like 1/99, 2/99, ..., 99/99, reducing them, the numerators are numbers co-prime to 99, but in reality, 1/99 is already reduced, 2/99 is reduced if 2 and 99 are coprime, which they are, so 2 is a numerator. Similarly, 3/99 reduces to 1/33, so numerator 1, which is already counted.

So, in reality, numerators can be numbers co-prime to various factors.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to note that the numerators m must be numbers such that m = k/d, where d is a divisor of 9999, and m is co-prime to 9999/d.

Thus, m must satisfy that m is co-prime to 9999/d, but m can be any number, as long as it's co-prime to 9999/d for some d.

Therefore, the numerators are the union over all d | 9999 of the sets {m | m ≤ 9999/d, gcd(m, 9999/d) = 1}.

But the issue is that these sets overlap; some m's are counted multiple times for different d's.

Hence, to find N, we need to compute the cardinality of the union of these sets.

Calculating the union is tricky because of overlaps, but perhaps we can use Möbius inversion or inclusion-exclusion.

Alternatively, note that the number of numerators is equal to the number of numbers m in [1, 9999] such that m is coprime to 9999/d for some d dividing 9999.

Which is equivalent to saying that m is coprime to 9999/e, where e is an idempotent element or something? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, actually, m can be any integer such that m is coprime to at least one divisor of 9999.

Wait, 9999 has divisors d1, d2, ..., dn. For each d, the set of m's coprime to d is the set of numbers not sharing any prime factors with d.

Since 9999 factors into 3², 11, and 101, the divisors are combinations of these primes.

Therefore, the numerators m must not be divisible by any combination of these primes.

Wait, but m can be anything, as long as it is coprime to at least one divisor of 9999.

But that doesn't restrict m much because every number is coprime to 1, which is a divisor of 9999.

Wait, but if we require that m is coprime to at least one proper divisor of 9999, but since 1 is a divisor, and every m is coprime to 1, so that condition is trivially satisfied.

Wait, perhaps that's not the correct interpretation.

Wait, stepping back, m is a numerator if m = k/d, where d divides 9999, and m is coprime to 9999/d.

So, m can be written as m = k/d, which implies that d divides k, so k = m*d.

Moreover, m must be coprime to 9999/d.

Therefore, m must satisfy that m and 9999/d are coprime.

But since d divides 9999, 9999/d is an integer.

Thus, m can be any integer such that m is coprime to 9999/d for some d dividing 9999.

But since d can be any divisor, including 1, m just needs to be coprime to some divisor of 9999.

But any integer m is coprime to 1, so m can be any integer from 1 upwards, but limited by the condition that m*d ≤ 9999.

Wait, but m*d must be ≤9999, but m can be as big as 9999 when d=1.

This is getting too abstract.

Wait, perhaps we can model this as follows:

Each numerator m must be such that m is coprime to 9999/d for some d | 9999. Thus, m can be any integer such that m is coprime to some divisor of 9999. But since 9999 is fixed, and its divisors include all combinations of its prime factors, m must not share any prime factors with 9999/d for some d.

But 9999/d can be any divisor of 9999 as well.

Wait, if d runs over all divisors of 9999, then 9999/d also runs over all divisors. So, m must be coprime to some divisor of 9999, which is equivalent to m being coprime to 9999 itself.

Wait, no, because m is coprime to 9999/d, which can be a proper divisor.

Wait, for example, take m=2. Then, is there a d such that 2 is coprime to 9999/d?

Yes, for example, d=1: 9999/d=9999, and gcd(2,9999)=1? 9999 is divisible by 3, 9, 11, etc., but not 2. So, gcd(2,9999)=1. Thus, m=2 is acceptable.

Similarly, m=3: check if there exists d such that 3 is coprime to 9999/d. Let d=3: 9999/d=3333, and gcd(3,3333)=3≠1. So, bad. Try d=9: 9999/d=1111, gcd(3,1111)=1. So, yes, m=3 is acceptable.

Wait, so m=3 is acceptable because for d=9, 9999/d=1111, and gcd(3,1111)=1.

Similarly, m=4: Check d=1: gcd(4,9999)=1, so m=4 is acceptable.

Wait, but 9999 is odd, so 2 does not divide it. So, any even number m would have gcd(m,9999)=1 if m is a power of 2. Wait, 9999 is 3²×11×101, so m can be any number not divisible by 3, 11, or 101? Or not necessarily?

Wait, no, because m needs to be coprime to 9999/d for some d.

So, for m to be a numerator, there must exist a divisor d of 9999 such that m is coprime to 9999/d.

But 9999/d is equal to (3²×11×101)/d.

Therefore, m must not share any prime factors with 9999/d.

Which implies that m cannot be divisible by any prime factor of 9999/d.

But d is a divisor, so 9999/d is another divisor.

Thus, the prime factors of 9999/d are a subset of {3,11,101}.

Therefore, m must not be divisible by any of the prime factors of 9999/d.

But since d can vary, m can be divisible by any combination of these primes, as long as for some d, m is not divisible by any prime factor of 9999/d.

Wait, confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps m must not be divisible by all prime factors of 9999.

Because if m is divisible by all prime factors of 9999, i.e., 3, 11, and 101, then for any d, 9999/d will have some subset of these primes, so m will share a common factor with 9999/d, hence m cannot be coprime to 9999/d.

Therefore, m must not be divisible by all three primes 3, 11, and 101.

Thus, numerators m are exactly those integers from 1 to 9999 that are not divisible by all three primes 3, 11, and 101.

Wait, but wait, let's test this with the examples.

Take m=1: Not divisible by any primes, so definitely included.

m=3: Divisible by 3, but not by 11 or 101, so included.

m=11: Divisible by 11, but not by 3 or 101, so included.

m=33: Divisible by 3 and 11, but not by 101, so included.

m=9999: Divisible by 3,11,101, so excluded.

So, according to this, numerators m are numbers not divisible by all three primes 3, 11, 101. Therefore, the number of such m's is equal to the total numbers minus those divisible by 3, 11, and 101.

Using inclusion-exclusion principle:

Total numbers: 9999

Subtract numbers divisible by 3, 11, or 101.

Add back numbers divisible by LCM(3,11)=33, LCM(3,101)=303, LCM(11,101)=1111.

Subtract numbers divisible by LCM(3,11,101)=3333.

Thus,

Numerator count N = Total - (A + B + C) + (D + E + F) - G

Where:
- A = numbers divisible by 3: floor(9999/3) = 3333
- B = numbers divisible by 11: floor(9999/11) = 909
- C = numbers divisible by 101: floor(9999/101) = 99
- D = numbers divisible by 33: floor(9999/33) = 303
- E = numbers divisible by 303: floor(9999/303) = 33
- F = numbers divisible by 1111: floor(9999/1111) = 9
- G = numbers divisible by 3333: floor(9999/3333) = 3

Plugging in:

N = 9999 - (3333 + 909 + 99) + (303 + 33 + 9) - 3

Calculate step by step:

First, compute A + B + C = 3333 + 909 + 99 = 4341

Then, compute D + E + F = 303 + 33 + 9 = 345

Then, subtract G = 3

Thus,

N = 9999 - 4341 + 345 - 3

Compute 9999 - 4341 = 5658

Then, 5658 + 345 = 6003

Then, 6003 - 3 = 6000

Therefore, N = 6000.

Wait, so according to this, the number of numerators is 6000.

But let's verify with the small example.

In the small example, n=99, so applying the same logic:

Total numbers: 99

Numbers divisible by 3: floor(99/3)=33

Divisible by 11: floor(99/11)=9

Divisible by 101: floor(99/101)=0

Numbers divisible by 33: floor(99/33)=3

Divisible by 303: floor(99/303)=0

Divisible by 1111: 0

Divisible by 3333: 0

Thus,

N = 99 - (33 + 9 + 0) + (3 + 0 + 0) - 0

Compute:

99 - 42 + 3 = 60

Which is correct because in the small example, the numerators are numbers from 1 to 99 not divisible by all three primes, but since 101 is larger than 99, only 3 and 11 matter, and the count is 60, which matches our expectation.

Hence, in the original problem, N=6000.

But let's confirm this.

Given N = 9999 - (3333 + 909 + 99) + (303 + 33 + 9) - 3

Compute:

3333 + 909 = 4242; 4242 + 99 = 4341

303 + 33 = 336; 336 + 9 = 345

G=3

Therefore,

N = 9999 - 4341 + 345 - 3

Compute 9999 - 4341: 9999 - 4000=5999; 5999 - 341=5658

5658 + 345: 5658 + 300=5958; 5958 +45=6003

6003 - 3=6000

Yes, N=6000.

Therefore, the number of distinct numerators is 6000. So, the answer is 6000 mod 1000= 6000 - 6*1000=0. So, 0.

But wait, 6000 divided by 1000 is 6 with remainder 0. So, 6000 mod 1000 is 0.

But before I conclude, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in interpreting the problem. It asks for the number of distinct numerators when the fractions are written in lowest terms, and then takes N mod 1000.

We found N=6000, so 6000 mod 1000 is 0. Therefore, the answer is 0.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{0}
</think>

To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of distinct numerators \( N \) when the repeating decimal numbers in the form \( 0.\overline{abcd} \) are written as fractions in lowest terms. Each repeating decimal \( 0.\overline{abcd} \) can be expressed as \( \frac{k}{9999} \) where \( k \) is an integer from 1 to 9999. 

When reduced, each fraction \( \frac{k}{9999} \) has a numerator \( m \) such that \( m = \frac{k}{\gcd(k, 9999)} \). The number of distinct numerators is equivalent to the number of integers \( m \) such that \( m \) is coprime to some divisor of 9999.

The prime factorization of 9999 is \( 3^2 \times 11 \times 101 \). Using the inclusion-exclusion principle, we calculate the number of integers from 1 to 9999 that are not divisible by all three primes 3, 11, and 101.

1. Total numbers: 9999
2. Subtract numbers divisible by 3, 11, or 101:
   - Numbers divisible by 3: \( \left\lfloor \frac{9999}{3} \right\rfloor = 3333 \)
   - Numbers divisible by 11: \( \left\lfloor \frac{9999}{11} \right\rfloor = 909 \)
   - Numbers divisible by 101: \( \left\lfloor \frac{9999}{101} \right\rfloor = 99 \)
3. Add back numbers divisible by the least common multiples of pairs of primes:
   - Numbers divisible by 33: \( \left\lfloor \frac{9999}{33} \right\rfloor = 303 \)
   - Numbers divisible by 303: \( \left\lfloor \frac{9999}{303} \right\rfloor = 33 \)
   - Numbers divisible by 1111: \( \left\lfloor \frac{9999}{1111} \right\rfloor = 9 \)
4. Subtract numbers divisible by the least common multiple of all three primes:
   - Numbers divisible by 3333: \( \left\lfloor \frac{9999}{3333} \right\rfloor = 3 \)

Putting it all together:

\[
N = 9999 - (3333 + 909 + 99) + (303 + 33 + 9) - 3
\]

Calculating step by step:

1. Compute \( 3333 + 909 + 99 = 4341 \)
2. Compute \( 303 + 33 + 9 = 345 \)
3. Compute \( N = 9999 - 4341 + 345 - 3 \)
4. Calculate \( 9999 - 4341 = 5658 \)
5. Calculate \( 5658 + 345 = 6003 \)
6. Calculate \( 6003 - 3 = 6000 \)

Thus, the number of distinct numerators \( N \) is 6000. Taking this result modulo 1000 gives:

\[
6000 \mod 1000 = 0
\]

The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{0}
\]
