 The problem: 
Let $S$ be the set of all rational numbers that can be expressed as a repeating decimal in the form $0.\overline{abcd},$ where at least one of the digits $a,$ $b,$ $c,$ or $d$ is nonzero. Let $N$ be the number of distinct numerators obtained when numbers in $S$ are written as fractions in lowest terms. For example, both $4$ and $410$ are counted among the distinct numerators for numbers in $S$ because $0.\overline{3636} = \frac{4}{11}$ and $0.\overline{1230} = \frac{410}{3333}.$ Find the remainder when $N$ is divided by $1000.$


Alright, so I have this problem here about repeating decimals and fractions. It says that S is the set of all rational numbers that can be expressed as a repeating decimal in the form 0.\overline{abcd}, where at least one of the digits a, b, c, or d is nonzero. Then, N is the number of distinct numerators when these numbers are written as fractions in their lowest terms. I need to find N mod 1000.

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. A repeating decimal like 0.\overline{abcd} means that the four-digit block abcd repeats indefinitely. So, for example, if a=1, b=2, c=3, d=4, then it's 0.123412341234... etc. Each such repeating decimal can be expressed as a fraction. The question is asking about the numerators of these fractions when they are reduced to lowest terms, and how many distinct numerators there are. Then, we take that count N and find its remainder when divided by 1000.

I remember that any repeating decimal with period n can be expressed as a fraction with denominator 10^n - 1. So, for a four-digit repeating decimal, the denominator would be 9999. But wait, not necessarily—because sometimes the fraction can be simplified further. For example, 0.\overline{1234} is equal to 1234/9999, but maybe 1234 and 9999 share a common factor. If they do, then the numerator would be 1234 divided by that common factor.

So, in general, each repeating decimal 0.\overline{abcd} corresponds to a numerator between 1 and 9998 (since at least one digit is nonzero) over 9999, but reduced to its simplest terms. Therefore, the numerator will be (abcd)/gcd(abcd, 9999), where abcd is the four-digit number formed by digits a, b, c, d.

But wait, actually, abcd isn't necessarily four digits because a could be zero? Hmm, no, because the decimal is 0.\overline{abcd}, so a is the first digit after the decimal, which can be zero, but at least one of a, b, c, d must be nonzero. So, abcd can be any four-digit string from 0001 to 9999, inclusive. So, abcd is an integer from 1 to 9999.

Therefore, for each such number k = abcd from 1 to 9999, we can write the fraction k / 9999, and then reduce it to lowest terms. The numerator in the reduced fraction would be k divided by the greatest common divisor of k and 9999, right?

Yes, exactly. So, the numerator is k / gcd(k, 9999). Therefore, the numerators we get are {k / gcd(k, 9999) | k = 1, 2, ..., 9999}. And N is the number of distinct numerators in this set.

So, to find N, I need to count how many distinct values of k / gcd(k, 9999) there are as k ranges from 1 to 9999.

Alternatively, since k and 9999 may share common factors, we can think about the possible numerators. Let’s denote d = gcd(k, 9999). Then, k = d * m, where m and 9999/d are coprime, right? Because d is the greatest common divisor, so m and 9999/d should be coprime.

So, substituting back, the numerator becomes (d * m) / d = m. So, the numerator is m, which is co-prime with 9999/d.

Wait, that seems a bit abstract. Maybe another approach is better. Since the numerator is m, and m must satisfy that m divides k, but k also divides 9999. Hmm, perhaps not.

Wait, let's go back. Let’s think in terms of fractions in lowest terms. The original fractions are k / 9999. When we reduce them, we divide numerator and denominator by their GCD, which is d = gcd(k, 9999). Thus, the reduced numerator is k/d, and the reduced denominator is 9999/d.

Since k ranges from 1 to 9999, k/d ranges from 1 to 9999/d, but only those integers that are multiples of k/d, but wait, actually, k/d must be less than or equal to 9999/d.

But more importantly, in the reduced fraction, the numerator k/d must be such that it is co-prime with the denominator 9999/d.

So, the numerator m = k/d must satisfy gcd(m, 9999/d) = 1.

Therefore, for each d dividing 9999, we can find the numerators m such that m is co-prime to 9999/d. The number of such numerators would be equal to Euler's totient function φ(9999/d).

But actually, since m can range up to 9999/d, but only those m co-prime to 9999/d. Wait, but for each d, the possible numerators m would be from 1 to 9999/d, co-prime to 9999/d.

Hence, for each divisor d of 9999, the number of numerators contributed is φ(9999/d). Therefore, the total number of distinct numerators N would be the sum over all divisors d of 9999 of φ(9999/d).

But wait, hold on. Is this correct?

Because for each k, you have a unique pair (d, m), where d = gcd(k, 9999) and m = k/d. Since k is between 1 and 9999, m is between 1 and 9999/d. Additionally, m must be co-prime to 9999/d.

Therefore, the numerators are precisely the numbers m co-prime to 9999/d for some d dividing 9999. So, if we consider all possible d, and for each d, count the number of m co-prime to 9999/d, that gives us N.

However, we have to be careful not to double-count numerators. Because different d might lead to the same m. Wait, but each m must correspond to a unique d, but m is determined by k/d, so m varies depending on d. Hmm, maybe my initial thought was incorrect.

Perhaps a better approach is to note that the set of numerators is exactly the set of integers m such that m divides some multiple of 9999, but that might not be precise.

Wait, let me try another angle. Since every numerator m is such that m divides 9999 times something? No, that's not quite right.

Wait, let's think about fractions in lowest terms. The denominators in the reduced fractions would be the divisors of 9999, since 9999 is the original denominator before reduction.

Given that 9999 has prime factors, let's factorize 9999 first.

9999 ÷ 9 = 1111

1111 ÷ 11 = 101

101 is a prime.

Therefore, 9999 = 9 × 11 × 101 = 3² × 11 × 101.

Thus, the number of divisors is (2+1)(1+1)(1+1) = 3×2×2=12. So, 12 divisors.

The divisors of 9999 are:

1, 3, 9, 11, 33, 99, 101, 303, 909, 1111, 3333, 9999.

Okay, so for each divisor d of 9999, the reduced denominator is 9999/d. Therefore, the reduced numerator m must satisfy m ≤ 9999/d and gcd(m, 9999/d) = 1.

Therefore, for each d, the number of numerators contributed is φ(9999/d). However, we have to ensure that numerators across different d's are unique. But wait, if we sum φ(9999/d) over all d, does that give us the total number of numerators? Or are there overlaps?

Wait, actually, for each numerator m, it can be paired with a unique d such that m is co-prime to 9999/d. So, if we fix d, then m must be co-prime to 9999/d. So, the set of all numerators is the union over all d|9999 of the numbers m with m ≤ 9999/d and gcd(m, 9999/d)=1.

But these sets might overlap, meaning that the same m could be achieved through different d's.

Hmm, so we can't just sum φ(9999/d) for all d|9999 because that would overcount numerators that can be represented with different d's.

Therefore, perhaps we need a different approach.

Another idea: since each numerator m must satisfy that m divides some number that is a multiple of 9999, but that might not be directly helpful.

Wait, perhaps instead of thinking about all possible numerators, think about the fact that each numerator m must be such that m and 9999/d are co-prime, where d is a divisor of 9999. So, m can be any integer from 1 upwards, but constrained by the fact that m ≤ 9999/d and co-prime to 9999/d.

But again, overlapping is a problem here.

Wait, maybe it's better to use inclusion-exclusion. Alternatively, notice that numerators are just integers co-prime to 9999/d for some d dividing 9999.

But this seems too vague.

Wait, another thought: since 9999 is fixed, and all the numerators are of the form k/d where d divides 9999 and k is divisible by d, but k and 9999 share d as their GCD.

Therefore, k = d*m, where m is co-prime to 9999/d.

Thus, m must be co-prime to 9999/d, which is equivalent to m being co-prime to 9999/d. So, m must satisfy gcd(m, 9999/d) = 1, and m ≤ 9999/d.

Thus, for each d, the number of such m is φ(9999/d). Therefore, the total number of numerators is the sum over all d|9999 of φ(9999/d). But as I thought earlier, does this count duplicates?

Wait, for example, suppose two different d's result in the same m. Then, m would be counted twice in the sum, leading to overcounting.

But actually, for a given m, it can only come from one particular d. Because m is co-prime to 9999/d, so m must be such that it doesn't share any factors with 9999/d. So, if d1 ≠ d2, is it possible that m is co-prime to 9999/d1 and also co-prime to 9999/d2, and thus appears in both sums? Maybe, but perhaps not necessarily.

Wait, let's test with an example. Take d1 = 3 and d2 = 9. Suppose m = 2.

Then, for d1=3, 9999/d1 = 3333. So, m=2 is co-prime to 3333 (since 2 and 3333 share no common factors besides 1). For d2=9, 9999/d2 = 1111. So, m=2 is co-prime to 1111 as well. So, m=2 would appear in both counts for d1 and d2. Hence, m=2 is counted twice in the sum.

Similarly, m=1 would be co-prime to everything, so it would be counted once for each d.

Therefore, indeed, the sum over all d|9999 of φ(9999/d) counts each m multiple times, once for each d that allows m to be co-prime to 9999/d.

Therefore, the total number of numerators N is not simply the sum, but rather, we have to compute the union of all such m's across all d's. So, we need to find the size of the union of these sets.

This seems complicated, but perhaps we can find a generating function or Möbius inversion formula to calculate this.

Alternatively, since 9999 is equal to 3² × 11 × 101, maybe we can analyze the numerators based on their divisibility by these primes.

Each numerator m must be co-prime to 9999/d for some d. That is, m must not share any prime factors with 9999/d.

But since 9999 is 3² × 11 × 101, the prime factors are 3, 11, and 101. So, m must not be divisible by any of the primes in 9999/d.

Wait, but 9999/d is equal to (3² × 11 × 101)/d. So, if d includes certain prime factors, 9999/d will exclude them.

Therefore, m needs to be co-prime to 9999/d, meaning m cannot have any prime factors that are in 9999/d.

But since 9999/d is (3² × 11 × 101)/d, then m must not have any prime factors that are in (3² × 11 × 101)/d.

In other words, m must not have any prime factors that are not in d.

Wait, maybe another way: m must not have any prime factors outside of d. Because if m had a prime factor that is in 9999/d, which is (3² × 11 × 101)/d, then m would share that prime with 9999/d, making gcd(m, 9999/d) > 1, which contradicts m being co-prime.

Therefore, m can only have prime factors that are present in d.

But d is a divisor of 9999, so d is a product of some combination of 3, 11, and 101. Therefore, the prime factors of m must be a subset of the prime factors of d.

Moreover, m must be co-prime to 9999/d, which implies that m cannot have any prime factors that are in 9999/d. Since 9999/d is (3² × 11 × 101)/d, which removes the prime factors of d.

Therefore, m can have prime factors only from d, but not from 9999/d.

Wait, this is getting a bit tangled. Maybe we can model this using the principle of inclusion-exclusion.

Alternatively, perhaps think in terms of the multiplicative functions.

Note that 9999 is squareful, specifically, it has prime powers: 3², 11¹, 101¹.

We can represent the problem as counting the number of positive integers m such that m is co-prime to 9999/d for some d dividing 9999, and m ≤ 9999/d.

But perhaps it's better to rephrase the problem in terms of m.

Suppose m is a positive integer such that there exists a d dividing 9999, where m is co-prime to 9999/d, and m ≤ 9999/d.

But this is equivalent to saying that m is co-prime to 9999/d for some d dividing 9999, with m ≤ 9999/d.

Alternatively, m must be co-prime to some divisor of 9999, and m must be less than or equal to that divisor.

Wait, that might be a useful rephrasing.

So, m must satisfy that there exists a divisor t of 9999 such that m ≤ t and gcd(m, t) = 1.

Because t = 9999/d, so d = 9999/t, and since d divides 9999, t must be a divisor of 9999 as well.

Therefore, the numerators m are exactly those integers m such that m is ≤ t and co-prime to t, for some t dividing 9999.

Thus, N is equal to the number of integers m such that m is ≤ t and co-prime to t, for some t dividing 9999.

But now, the key is to count all such m without duplication.

That is, N is the number of distinct m where m is ≤ t and co-prime to t, for some t dividing 9999.

So, how do we count this?

Well, for each t dividing 9999, we can count the numbers m ≤ t with gcd(m, t) = 1, but ensuring that we don't count the same m multiple times if it satisfies the condition for multiple t's.

Therefore, N is the size of the union over all t|9999 of the sets {m | m ≤ t, gcd(m, t) = 1}.

To compute this, we can use the inclusion-exclusion principle.

But first, let's figure out what these sets look like.

For each t, the set {m | m ≤ t, gcd(m, t) = 1} is exactly the set of numbers from 1 to t that are co-prime to t, which is the definition of Euler's totient function φ(t). However, φ(t) counts the numbers less than t, but here we include m = t as well if t is co-prime to itself, which only happens when t = 1.

But wait, actually, for t = 1, m can only be 1, since m ≤ t. So, for t =1, the set is {1}.

For t = 3, the set is {1, 2} because 3 is co-prime to 1 and 2.

Wait, hold on. No, actually, if t is 3, then m must satisfy gcd(m, 3) = 1, so m can be 1 or 2.

Similarly, for t = 9, m must satisfy gcd(m, 9) = 1, so m can be 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8.

Wait, but for t = 9, m can be up to 9, so including 9 itself? But 9 and 9 are not co-prime. So, m must be from 1 to 8, co-prime to 9, so φ(9) = 6.

Similarly, for t = 11, φ(11) = 10, since 11 is prime.

For t = 33, φ(33) = φ(3×11) = (3-1)(11-1) = 2×10 = 20.

For t = 99, φ(99) = φ(9×11) = φ(9)φ(11) = 6×10 = 60.

For t = 101, φ(101) = 100.

For t = 303, φ(303) = φ(3×101) = 2×100 = 200.

For t = 909, φ(909) = φ(9×101) = φ(9)φ(101) = 6×100 = 600.

For t = 1111, φ(1111) = φ(11×101) = 10×100 = 1000.

For t = 3333, φ(3333) = φ(3×11×101) = (3-1)(11-1)(101-1) = 2×10×100 = 2000.

For t = 9999, φ(9999) = φ(3²×11×101) = φ(9)φ(11)φ(101) = 6×10×100 = 6000.

Wait, but hold on. So, for each t dividing 9999, φ(t) counts the number of m's from 1 to t that are co-prime to t.

But when considering the union over all t, we have to account for overlaps where a single m is co-prime to multiple t's.

Therefore, N is equal to the union of all these sets {m | m ≤ t, gcd(m, t)=1}, for t dividing 9999.

Calculating the union is tricky because of overlaps, but perhaps we can use Möbius inversion.

Alternatively, we can note that the union is precisely the set of positive integers m such that m is co-prime to at least one divisor t of 9999, with m ≤ t.

But m can be as large as 9999, but for each m, if m ≤ t and m is co-prime to t, then m must be co-prime to 9999/m'.

Wait, perhaps that's not the right path.

Wait, another idea: since t divides 9999, and m ≤ t, co-prime to t, then m must be co-prime to 9999/gcd(t, m') where m' is something else? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, maybe an alternative approach: instead of looking at m, let's look at the reduced denominators.

Each reduced denominator is t = 9999/d, where d is a divisor of 9999.

And for each t, the numerators m are co-prime to t and m ≤ t.

Therefore, the numerators m can be any integer co-prime to t, up to t. But if we collect all these m's across all t's, the total number of distinct numerators is the number of integers m such that m is co-prime to some t dividing 9999, and m ≤ t.

But again, this brings us back to the same issue of overlapping m's across different t's.

Wait, maybe it's simpler than I'm making it. Let's recall that when you have a repeating decimal 0.\overline{abcd}, it's equal to (abcd)/9999. Then, the reduced fraction is (abcd)/gcd(abcd, 9999). Therefore, the numerator is (abcd)/g, where g = gcd(abcd, 9999).

Therefore, each numerator is a number of the form k = (abcd)/g, where g divides 9999.

But abcd is from 1 to 9999, so k ranges from 1 to 9999/g, but k must be co-prime to 9999/g.

Wait, so each numerator is an integer co-prime to some divisor of 9999, and less than or equal to that divisor.

So, essentially, the set of numerators is the union over all divisors t of 9999 of the numbers co-prime to t and ≤ t.

But this is similar to the earlier thought process.

Thus, the total number of numerators N is equal to the number of integers m such that m is co-prime to t for some t dividing 9999, and m ≤ t.

Therefore, to compute N, we can consider all pairs (t, m) where t divides 9999, m ≤ t, and gcd(m, t) = 1, and then count the distinct m's.

But since m can be co-prime to multiple t's, it's challenging to count them without overcounting.

An alternative method is to realize that the numerators m correspond to the numbers co-prime to 9999, multiplied by some scaling factor.

Wait, but perhaps not. Let me think differently.

If I fix m, then for m to be a numerator, there must exist a t dividing 9999 such that m ≤ t and gcd(m, t) = 1. So, t must be a multiple of m, because m ≤ t. Moreover, t must be such that gcd(m, t) = 1.

But if t is a multiple of m, say t = m*k, then gcd(m, t) = gcd(m, m*k) = m*gcd(1, k) = m. But we require that gcd(m, t) = 1, so m must be 1.

Wait, that's only possible if m=1. But that can't be, because in the example given, m=410 is a numerator.

Wait, so my reasoning must be flawed.

Wait, perhaps not necessarily t is a multiple of m, but m just needs to be co-prime to t, regardless of whether m divides t or not. So, m and t can share no common factors, even if m doesn't divide t.

Therefore, m can be any number co-prime to t, and less than or equal to t, for some t.

But still, it's unclear how to count the union.

Wait, perhaps another way: since 9999 is squareful, maybe the problem relates to the totatives of 9999, but I'm not sure.

Wait, alternatively, note that the numerators m can be any positive integer such that m is co-prime to at least one divisor of 9999, and m ≤ that divisor.

So, for each m, check if there exists a t dividing 9999 such that m ≤ t and gcd(m, t) = 1.

If such a t exists, then m is included in N.

Therefore, to compute N, we need to count all m ≥1 such that there exists a t | 9999 with m ≤ t and gcd(m, t)=1.

Now, the maximum m can be is 9999, but since t can be up to 9999, m can be up to 9999, but only if m=1, because m must be co-prime to t=9999. But for other m's, t can be smaller.

Wait, no. For example, m=2 is co-prime to t=3, so t=3 works, hence m=2 is included.

Similarly, m=4 is co-prime to t=9, since gcd(4,9)=1, so m=4 is included.

Wait, so in fact, for any m, as long as m is co-prime to some divisor t of 9999, and m ≤ t, then m is included.

Therefore, N is the number of integers m where 1 ≤ m ≤ 9999 and m is co-prime to at least one divisor t of 9999, with m ≤ t.

So, how can we compute this?

It's similar to counting the numbers m ≤ 9999 that are co-prime to some t | 9999, with m ≤ t.

Alternatively, think of it as numbers m such that m is co-prime to 9999/m', but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps using Möbius inversion.

Define f(t) as the number of m's ≤ t co-prime to t. Then, the total number N is the union over all t | 9999 of f(t). But since the union can have overlaps, it's not straightforward to compute.

Alternatively, the inclusion-exclusion principle: for each t, add f(t), subtract the overlaps, add overlaps of overlaps, etc.

But that sounds computationally intensive, especially since 9999 has 12 divisors.

Wait, 12 divisors is manageable. Maybe we can compute the union by inclusion-exclusion over the divisors.

Wait, but inclusion-exclusion over 12 divisors is going to be complex, but perhaps doable.

Recall that the inclusion-exclusion principle for the union over sets A_t (where A_t is the set of m ≤ t with gcd(m, t)=1) is:

|A| = Σ|A_t| - Σ|A_{t1} ∩ A_{t2}| + Σ|A_{t1} ∩ A_{t2} ∩ A_{t3}| - ... + (-1)^{k+1} Σ|A_{t1} ∩ ... ∩ A_{tk}}| + ... 

Where the intersections are over all combinations of the sets A_t.

But in our case, the sets A_t are defined over m's, so the intersection A_{t1} ∩ A_{t2} is the set of m's that are ≤ t1, co-prime to t1, and ≤ t2, co-prime to t2.

But wait, actually, m has to satisfy m ≤ t1 and co-prime to t1, and m ≤ t2 and co-prime to t2. So, effectively, m must be ≤ min(t1, t2), and co-prime to both t1 and t2.

But since t1 and t2 are divisors of 9999, their gcd is also a divisor.

Therefore, the intersection A_{t1} ∩ A_{t2} is the set of m ≤ min(t1, t2) with gcd(m, lcm(t1, t2))=1.

Wait, no, actually, it's more precise to say that m must be co-prime to both t1 and t2, which is equivalent to m being co-prime to lcm(t1, t2). But since t1 and t2 are divisors of 9999, their lcm is also a divisor of 9999.

Wait, but since t1 and t2 are both divisors of 9999, their lcm is the least common multiple, which is also a divisor of 9999.

Therefore, the intersection A_{t1} ∩ A_{t2} is the set of m ≤ min(t1, t2) such that m is co-prime to lcm(t1, t2).

Similarly, higher-order intersections involve more conditions.

This seems complicated, but perhaps manageable with inclusion-exclusion.

But considering that 9999 has 12 divisors, the number of subsets is 2^12 = 4096, which is unmanageable manually.

Wait, but perhaps instead of considering all possible intersections, we can think in terms of the Möbius function.

Wait, I recall that the number of integers ≤ x co-prime to n is given by the sum_{d|n} μ(d) * floor(x/d).

But in our case, the sets are A_t, which are m ≤ t, co-prime to t.

Therefore, |A_t| = φ(t), since it's the number of integers ≤ t co-prime to t.

Similarly, |A_{t1} ∩ A_{t2}| = the number of m ≤ min(t1, t2) co-prime to lcm(t1, t2).

But wait, actually, if m must be co-prime to both t1 and t2, then it's co-prime to lcm(t1, t2). So, |A_{t1} ∩ A_{t2}| = the number of m ≤ min(t1, t2) co-prime to lcm(t1, t2).

Which is equal to the sum_{d | lcm(t1, t2)} μ(d) * floor( min(t1, t2) / d ).

But calculating this for each pair is complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps we can model the problem as follows:

Each m can be assigned to the smallest t such that m ≤ t and gcd(m, t)=1. Then, N is the number of such m's.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps note that N is equal to the number of fractions k/9999 in lowest terms where k ranges from 1 to 9999, but considering that different k's can reduce to the same numerator.

But that is essentially the same as the previous thoughts.

Wait, stepping back, maybe the number N is equal to the sum over d|9999 of φ(d), because for each d, the numerators are the numbers co-prime to 9999/d, and φ(9999/d) counts them, but if we don't have overlapping, it's just the sum.

But in reality, as we saw earlier, the same m can be achieved via different d's. So, perhaps N is less than the sum of φ(9999/d) over d|9999.

Wait, so let's calculate the sum of φ(9999/d) over all d|9999.

Given that 9999 = 3² × 11 × 101.

Divisors d of 9999 are generated by exponents of primes:

For 3: 0,1,2

For 11: 0,1

For 101: 0,1

Total 3×2×2=12 divisors.

Each d corresponds to a triplet (a,b,c) where a ∈ {0,1,2}, b,c ∈ {0,1}

Then, 9999/d would have exponents (2-a, 1-b, 1-c)

Therefore, 9999/d is 3^{2-a} × 11^{1-b} × 101^{1-c}

So, φ(9999/d) = φ(3^{2-a}) × φ(11^{1-b}) × φ(101^{1-c})

Compute φ(3^{2-a}):

If a=0: φ(9)=6

a=1: φ(3)=2

a=2: φ(1)=1

Similarly, φ(11^{1-b}):

If b=0: φ(11)=10

b=1: φ(1)=1

φ(101^{1-c}):

If c=0: φ(101)=100

c=1: φ(1)=1

Therefore, for each divisor d, φ(9999/d) is:

Product over primes:

φ(3^{2-a}) × φ(11^{1-b}) × φ(101^{1-c})

So, for each d, we can compute φ(9999/d):

Let’s list all 12 divisors and their corresponding φ(9999/d):

1. d=1 (a=0,b=0,c=0): φ(9999/1)=φ(9999)=φ(3²×11×101)= (9 - 3) × (11 -1) × (101 -1)= 6 ×10×100=6000

Wait, no, that's incorrect. φ(n) for n = p^k is p^k - p^{k-1}. So,

φ(3²)= 9 - 3 = 6

φ(11)=11-1=10

φ(101)=101-1=100

Thus, φ(9999)=6×10×100=6000

Similarly, for d=3:

a=1, so φ(3^{2-1}=3^1)=φ(3)=2

φ(11^{1-0}=11^1)=10

φ(101^{1-0}=101^1)=100

So φ(9999/3)=2×10×100=2000

d=9:

a=2, φ(3^{2-2}=3^0)=φ(1)=1

φ(11)=10

φ(101)=100

So φ(9999/9)=1×10×100=1000

d=11:

a=0, φ(3^{2-0}=9)=6

b=1, φ(11^{1-1}=1)=1

c=0, φ(101^{1-0}=101)=100

So φ(9999/11)=6×1×100=600

d=33:

a=1, φ(3^{2-1}=3)=2

b=1, φ(11^{1-1}=1)=1

c=0, φ(101^{1-0}=101)=100

So φ(9999/33)=2×1×100=200

d=99:

a=2, φ(3^{2-2}=1)=1

b=1, φ(11^{1-1}=1)=1

c=0, φ(101^{1-0}=101)=100

So φ(9999/99)=1×1×100=100

d=101:

a=0, φ(3²)=6

b=0, φ(11^{1-0}=11)=10

c=1, φ(101^{1-1}=1)=1

So φ(9999/101)=6×10×1=60

d=303:

a=1, φ(3^{2-1}=3)=2

b=0, φ(11^{1-0}=11)=10

c=1, φ(101^{1-1}=1)=1

So φ(9999/303)=2×10×1=20

d=909:

a=2, φ(3^{2-2}=1)=1

b=0, φ(11^{1-0}=11)=10

c=1, φ(101^{1-1}=1)=1

So φ(9999/909)=1×10×1=10

d=1111:

a=0, φ(3²)=6

b=1, φ(11^{1-1}=1)=1

c=1, φ(101^{1-1}=1)=1

So φ(9999/1111)=6×1×1=6

d=3333:

a=1, φ(3^{2-1}=3)=2

b=1, φ(11^{1-1}=1)=1

c=1, φ(101^{1-1}=1)=1

So φ(9999/3333)=2×1×1=2

d=9999:

a=2, φ(3^{2-2}=1)=1

b=1, φ(11^{1-1}=1)=1

c=1, φ(101^{1-1}=1)=1

So φ(9999/9999)=1×1×1=1

Therefore, compiling all these:

d : φ(9999/d)

1 : 6000

3 : 2000

9 : 1000

11 : 600

33 : 200

99 : 100

101 : 60

303 : 20

909 : 10

1111 : 6

3333 : 2

9999 : 1

Now, if we sum all these φ(9999/d), we get:

6000 + 2000 + 1000 + 600 + 200 + 100 + 60 + 20 + 10 + 6 + 2 + 1.

Let me compute that:

Start adding:

6000 + 2000 = 8000

8000 + 1000 = 9000

9000 + 600 = 9600

9600 + 200 = 9800

9800 + 100 = 9900

9900 + 60 = 9960

9960 + 20 = 9980

9980 + 10 = 9990

9990 + 6 = 9996

9996 + 2 = 9998

9998 + 1 = 9999

Wow! The total sum is 9999.

So, Σ φ(9999/d) over all d|9999 equals 9999. Which makes sense because each number from 1 to 9999 is counted once for each of its divisors, but since φ(n) counts numbers co-prime to n, when you sum φ(n) over the divisors, you get the total count.

But in our problem, we're trying to find the number of distinct numerators, which is the number of distinct m's such that m is co-prime to some t, where t divides 9999, and m <= t.

But in the above calculation, we see that the sum of φ(9999/d) over d|9999 is equal to 9999, which is the total number of numbers from 1 to 9999. But in our case, N is supposed to be the number of unique m's where m is co-prime to 9999/d and m <= 9999/d.

But wait, in the sum above, each number k from 1 to 9999 is counted as m in exactly φ(9999/k') where k' is the gcd(k,9999). Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, each m is counted once for each d where d divides 9999 and m <= t and gcd(m,t)=1.

But if the sum is 9999, which is the same as the total number of m's, but N is the number of unique m's. So, unless each m is counted exactly once, N would be 9999. But that can't be because different d's can produce the same m.

Wait, but in the previous examples, m=410 was a numerator, but m=2 is another numerator. So, N must be significantly less than 9999.

Wait, so perhaps my initial assumption is wrong, and N is not equal to 9999. So, why did the sum of φ(9999/d) equal 9999?

Because when you consider for each d, the numbers m co-prime to 9999/d, and m <= 9999/d, and then summing φ(9999/d) over d, you end up counting each m exactly once for each d where m <= 9999/d and gcd(m, 9999/d)=1.

But since m can be counted multiple times across different d's, the total sum is larger than N.

So, perhaps N is the number of m's such that there exists at least one d where m <= 9999/d and gcd(m, 9999/d)=1.

Therefore, to find N, we need to count all m's in [1,9999] such that m is co-prime to at least one divisor t of 9999, with m <= t.

But how can we compute that?

Alternatively, note that N is equal to the number of m's such that m is co-prime to 9999/m', where m' is some multiple of m.

Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, think of it as m must be co-prime to 9999/m''. Not helpful.

Wait, perhaps another angle.

Suppose m is a numerator, then m must divide some k, and k must be co-prime to 9999/m.

Wait, this is getting too convoluted.

Wait, maybe think of it as m is co-prime to 9999/gcd(m,9999). Because when you write k = m * d, where d = gcd(k,9999). Then, m must be co-prime to 9999/d.

But since d = gcd(m*d,9999) = gcd(m,9999)*gcd(d,9999/d). Wait, not exactly.

Wait, perhaps too confusing.

Alternatively, note that m must be co-prime to 9999/gcd(m,9999). So, m is co-prime to 9999 divided by the gcd of m and 9999.

Therefore, m must lie in the set of numbers co-prime to 9999/gcd(m,9999).

But 9999/gcd(m,9999) is equal to 9999/(some divisor of 9999), so it's another divisor of 9999.

Therefore, m must be co-prime to some t, where t divides 9999, and m <= t.

But then, the set of such m's is the union over all t|9999 of the set {m | m <= t, gcd(m,t)=1}.

Therefore, N is equal to the number of integers m in [1,9999] such that m is co-prime to at least one t dividing 9999, with m <= t.

So, to compute N, perhaps it's equal to the number of m's such that m is co-prime to 9999/(m'), where m' is some divisor of 9999 greater than or equal to m.

Wait, maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps the numbers m in question are exactly the numbers co-prime to 9999, but I don't think so because in the example, 410 is a numerator but 410 and 9999 have a common factor?

Wait, let's check gcd(410, 9999).

9999 = 3²×11×101

410 = 2×5×41

So, yes, gcd(410, 9999)=1, because 410 shares no prime factors with 9999.

Similarly, gcd(410, 9999)=1, so 410 is co-prime to 9999.

Wait, but 410 is less than 9999, but co-prime to 9999. So, perhaps all m's co-prime to 9999 are included, but also others?

Wait, no, because if m is co-prime to 9999, then it's automatically co-prime to 9999/m', where m'=1.

Therefore, m is co-prime to t=9999, so m is included in A_{9999}.

But also, m can be co-prime to smaller t's.

Therefore, the set of m's co-prime to 9999 is a subset of N.

But N is larger because it includes m's that are co-prime to t's smaller than 9999.

But how much larger is N compared to the φ(9999)?

Well, φ(9999) = 6000, as computed earlier.

But N is definitely larger than 6000, as seen from the example.

But how much larger?

Wait, perhaps the number N is equal to the number of m's co-prime to at least one prime factor of 9999.

But 9999 factors into 3², 11, and 101.

So, m must be co-prime to 3, 11, or 101.

But m can be co-prime to all three as well.

Wait, but that would imply that m is co-prime to 9999, but that's not necessarily the case because m could be co-prime to 3, but not to 11 or 101, etc.

Wait, actually, if m is co-prime to at least one of 3,11,101, then m is co-prime to 9999 only if it's co-prime to all three.

Wait, no. For example, if m is co-prime to 3, but shares a factor with 11 or 101, it's not co-prime to 9999.

But for m to be co-prime to at least one t dividing 9999, t can be 3, 11, 101, etc.

Wait, perhaps not.

Alternatively, think in terms of inclusion-exclusion over the prime factors.

Wait, but perhaps it's too messy.

Wait, perhaps instead of trying to compute N directly, let's consider that N is equal to the number of fractions k/9999 in lowest terms, but allowing k to be greater than 9999, but mapping them to m's as per the division algorithm.

Wait, no, k is at most 9999.

Wait, confusion arises.

Wait, perhaps I need to accept that computing N requires finding the number of m's co-prime to at least one t|9999, m<=t.

And since 9999 has small number of divisors, maybe it's feasible to compute N by inclusion-exclusion.

But inclusion-exclusion over 12 divisors is too cumbersome.

Alternatively, since N counts numbers m such that m is co-prime to some t|9999, with m <= t, and m can be written as m = k / (9999/d), where d|9999, and k is co-prime to d.

Wait, perhaps it's time to refer back to the problem statement.

Wait, the problem says "the number of distinct numerators obtained when numbers in S are written as fractions in lowest terms."

From the examples given, 4 and 410 are numerators. 4 is co-prime to 9999, as 4 and 9999 are co-prime. 410 is also co-prime to 9999.

Wait, is every numerator co-prime to 9999? Let's see.

Take for example, the fraction 1/2. 0.\overline{001000} is 1/9999, but 1/2 is 0.5, which is a finite decimal, but in the problem, S consists of numbers that can be expressed as a repeating decimal in four digits, which suggests that all elements of S are of the form k/9999 with k from 1 to 9999.

Wait, but 1/2 is not in S because it's a finite decimal, but S is defined as numbers that can be expressed as a repeating decimal in four digits.

Wait, hold on, is that accurate?

Wait, actually, in the problem statement, S is defined as numbers that can be expressed as a repeating decimal in the form 0.\overline{abcd}, where at least one of a,b,c,d is non-zero.

But 0.\overline{0001} is 1/9999, but 0.\overline{0005} is 5/9999, which reduces to 1/1999.5, but wait, no, 5/9999 is already in lowest terms.

Wait, but 1/2 is 0.5, which is a terminating decimal, but it's not a repeating decimal. So, 1/2 is not in S because it can't be expressed as a four-digit repeating decimal.

Therefore, all elements of S are numbers that can be expressed as k/9999 with k from 1 to 9999, but with k such that the decimal repeats every four digits.

Wait, but actually, the definition says "a repeating decimal in the form 0.\overline{abcd}," which is inherently a four-digit repeating cycle.

Therefore, any number in S must have a purely repeating decimal expansion with period dividing 4, but since 4 is the minimal period? Or not necessarily.

Wait, for example, 1/3 is 0.\overline{3}, which has period 1, but it can also be written as 0.\overline{0003}, which has period 4. Similarly, 1/2 is 0.5000..., which technically can be written as 0.\overline{5000}, but that's a terminating decimal. However, the problem specifies that at least one of a,b,c,d is non-zero, so 0.\overline{5000} fits because a=5, b=c=d=0, but at least one is non-zero.

Wait, so perhaps 1/2 is in S because it can be expressed as 0.\overline{5000}, where a=5, b=c=d=0.

But 1/2 is equal to 0.5, which is a terminating decimal, but in the form 0.\overline{5000}, it is considered a four-digit repeating decimal. So, according to the problem's definition, it's included.

But in that case, S includes all numbers of the form k/9999 where k is from 1 to 9999, but also numbers like 1/2, which can be expressed as 0.\overline{5000}.

Wait, but 1/2 is equal to 5000/9999, so k=5000.

So, S is actually exactly the set of fractions k/9999 where k is from 1 to 9999.

Therefore, S is {1/9999, 2/9999, ..., 9999/9999}.

But 9999/9999 is 1, which is an integer.

Therefore, all elements of S are fractions with denominator 9999, numerator from 1 to 9999.

Thus, writing each element in lowest terms, the numerator is k / gcd(k,9999), and the denominator is 9999 / gcd(k,9999).

Therefore, the numerators are exactly the numbers m = k / gcd(k,9999), where k ranges from 1 to 9999.

Thus, m can be any integer such that m = k / d, where d = gcd(k,9999), and m must satisfy that gcd(m, 9999/d)=1, as we've established before.

Therefore, the set of numerators is the union over all d|9999 of {m | m = k/d, k ≡ 0 mod d, gcd(k/d, 9999/d)=1, m ≤ 9999/d}.

But 9999/d can be as large as 9999 (when d=1), down to 1 (when d=9999).

Therefore, the numerators are exactly all integers m such that m is co-prime to 9999/d for some d dividing 9999, and m ≤ 9999/d.

Thus, N is the number of integers m in [1, 9999] such that there exists a divisor t of 9999 with m ≤ t and gcd(m, t)=1.

Therefore, N is the count of such m's.

But how to compute N?

Wait, perhaps another way: since 9999 = 3²×11×101, which are all prime factors, then m must not share any common factors with 9999 except possibly 1.

But wait, m can share a factor with 9999 as long as that factor is canceled out by d.

Wait, for example, if d=3, then m can be multiples of 3, but co-prime to 9999/3=3333.

But 3333=3×11×101, so m can be multiples of 3, as long as they are co-prime to 11 and 101.

But then, such m's are multiples of 3, but not multiples of 11 or 101.

Similarly, for d=9, m can be multiples of 9, but co-prime to 11 and 101.

Wait, this seems too vague.

Alternatively, perhaps note that each m can be associated with a unique triple (a, b, c) where a is exponent of 3 in m, b is exponent of 11, c is exponent of 101.

But since m is co-prime to t = 9999/d, which is another divisor, the exponents of 3, 11, 101 in m must be less than or equal to those in t.

Wait, perhaps it's too abstract.

Alternatively, maybe the number N is equal to the number of fractions k/9999 in lowest terms, which is equal to φ(9999) = 6000. But the example shows that 410 is a numerator, which is co-prime to 9999, so it's counted in φ(9999). Similarly, 4 is co-prime to 9999, so it's also counted in φ(9999). So, in that case, maybe N is equal to φ(9999). But in the example, both 4 and 410 are numerators, which are both co-prime to 9999, so they are counted in φ(9999).

Wait, but wait, 410 is 410, which is co-prime to 9999, so it's in φ(9999). Similarly, 4 is co-prime to 9999.

So, perhaps N is equal to φ(9999) = 6000.

But wait, in the example, 410 is a numerator, but 410 is equal to 410, which is co-prime to 9999. So, 410 is in the set of numerators, as it comes from the fraction 410/9999, which reduces to 410/9999 since they're co-prime.

Similarly, 4 is a numerator from 4/9999.

Therefore, perhaps N is equal to the number of numbers co-prime to 9999, which is φ(9999) = 6000. But wait, but in the problem statement, 410 is an example of a numerator, but 410 is co-prime to 9999, so it's already included in φ(9999). Similarly, 4 is co-prime to 9999.

But wait, let me check 1/2, which is 5000/9999, which reduces to 5000/9999, since 5000 and 9999 are co-prime (as 5000=2^3×5^4, and 9999=3²×11×101; no common factors). So, 5000 is co-prime to 9999, so 5000 is also a numerator.

Wait, but 5000 is co-prime to 9999, so it's in φ(9999). So, all these numerators are co-prime to 9999, so N is exactly φ(9999) = 6000.

But wait, the problem states that N is the number of distinct numerators when written in lowest terms. So, if all numerators are co-prime to 9999, then N is equal to φ(9999) = 6000.

But wait, let me test with another example. Suppose k=3, which is co-prime to 9999. So, 3/9999 reduces to 1/3333, whose numerator is 1. So, 1 is a numerator.

Similarly, k=6, which is not co-prime to 9999 (since gcd(6,9999)=3). So, 6/9999 reduces to 2/3333, numerator 2.

Here, 2 is co-prime to 3333? 2 and 3333 are co-prime, yes.

Wait, so in this case, the numerator is 2, which is co-prime to 3333, but 2 is also co-prime to 9999? Yes, because 2 is a new prime not in 9999.

Wait, so in this case, 2 is a numerator, and 2 is co-prime to 9999.

Wait, so in essence, every numerator is co-prime to 9999, because if m is a numerator, then m = k / d, where d = gcd(k,9999), and 9999/d is co-prime to m.

Therefore, since 9999 is factored into 3², 11, 101, and m is constructed by dividing k by d, which includes all factors of 3, 11, 101 in k, then m must be co-prime to 9999.

Therefore, all numerators must be co-prime to 9999, and since all co-prime numbers are covered in φ(9999), which is 6000.

But wait, in the earlier example, 4/9999 reduces to 4/9999 since 4 and 9999 are co-prime, so 4 is a numerator.

Similarly, 410/9999 is already co-prime, so 410 is a numerator.

But wait, suppose k=3, which reduces to 1/3333, numerator 1.

k=6 reduces to 2/3333, numerator 2.

k=9 reduces to 1/1111, numerator 1.

k=12 reduces to 4/3333, numerator 4.

Wait, but 4 is co-prime to 3333, yes, because 3333=3×11×101.

Therefore, 4 is co-prime to 3333.

Similarly, 4 and 3333 are co-prime.

Therefore, all numerators are co-prime to their respective denominators, which are 9999/d.

But 9999/d is a factor of 9999, so co-prime to m.

But then, m must be co-prime to 9999, because if m shared a factor with 9999, say 3, then since m is co-prime to 9999/d, which is a multiple of 3, that would cause a contradiction.

Wait, perhaps m must be co-prime to 9999.

Wait, let me test:

If m is a numerator, then m is co-prime to 9999/d, where d = gcd(k,9999). But 9999/d is a factor of 9999, so if m shares a common factor with 9999, say 3, then since 9999/d is a multiple of 3, m cannot be co-prime to 9999/d. Therefore, m must be co-prime to 9999.

Therefore, all numerators m must be co-prime to 9999.

Hence, N is equal to the number of integers m from 1 to 9999 that are co-prime to 9999, which is exactly φ(9999) = 6000.

But wait, in our earlier example, m=4 is co-prime to 9999, so it's included. Similarly, m=410 is co-prime to 9999, so it's included.

But hang on, 410 is 410, which is 2×5×41, none of which are factors of 9999, so it's co-prime.

But if I take m=10, which is co-prime to 9999, then it is a numerator. Indeed, 10/9999 is already in lowest terms, so 10 is a numerator.

Similarly, m=100 is co-prime to 9999, so it's a numerator.

Wait, so N is indeed equal to φ(9999) = 6000.

But the problem statement says that N is the number of distinct numerators, so N=6000.

But wait, in the problem statement, it's given as an example that 4 and 410 are numerators. 4 is co-prime to 9999, as is 410, so both are included in φ(9999)=6000.

Therefore, N is 6000.

But 6000 divided by 1000 is 6, so the remainder is 0.

But wait, wait, the problem statement says that N is the number of distinct numerators, but in the examples, numerators can be 4, 410, etc. So, maybe N is 6000, but modulo 1000, 6000 mod 1000 is 0.

But I feel like I must have made a mistake because the problem seems to suggest that N is around 9999, but in this case, it's 6000.

Wait, but wait, let's go back.

Earlier, I thought that N is the number of numerators, which are m's co-prime to 9999, giving 6000. But in the problem, S is the set of numbers that can be expressed as 0.\overline{abcd}, which are exactly the fractions k/9999, k=1,...,9999. So, when written in lowest terms, their numerators are k / gcd(k,9999), which must be co-prime to 9999/gcd(k,9999).

But as shown earlier, this implies that the numerator must be co-prime to 9999, so N is φ(9999)=6000.

But the problem says that N is the number of distinct numerators, which is 6000, so 6000 mod 1000 is 0.

But in the problem statement, the example shows 4 and 410, which are both co-prime to 9999, so they are included in N=6000.

But 6000 is 6*1000, so 6000 mod 1000 is 0.

But I feel like this might be incorrect because in the problem statement, they gave examples of numerators 4 and 410, which are both less than 1000, but N is 6000, which is much larger.

Wait, but 6000 is the number of integers co-prime to 9999 between 1 and 9999.

Wait, but 9999 is 10000 -1, which is close to 10000, so the number of co-primes should be roughly 9999*(6/π²) ≈ 6000.

Therefore, it seems consistent.

But let me verify with a smaller example.

Suppose we have numbers that can be expressed as a repeating decimal of period 2, i.e., 0.\overline{ab}, which is equal to (10a + b)/99.

Then, S is the set {(10a + b)/99 | a,b digits, not both zero}. So, numbers like 1/99, 2/99, ..., 99/99.

When written in lowest terms, the numerators are (10a + b)/gcd(10a + b,99).

Thus, the number of distinct numerators N is the number of integers m such that m is co-prime to 99/(gcd(10a + b,99)).

But 99=9×11.

So, the numerators are co-prime to either 9 or 11.

Wait, no, m must be co-prime to 99/(gcd(...)), which depends.

But in this case, the numerators are numbers co-prime to 99, 33, 11, etc.

Wait, perhaps the number of numerators is φ(99) + ... ?

Wait, but in this case, the number of numerators is equal to the number of integers co-prime to 9 or 11 or something.

Wait, perhaps in this smaller case, the number of numerators is φ(99) + φ(9) + φ(11) - something.

But actually, it's getting too involved.

Alternatively, perhaps in the smaller case, N would be the number of numbers co-prime to 9 or 11, but since 9 and 11 are co-prime, the number of co-primes to 9 or 11 is φ(9) + φ(11) - φ(1) = 6 + 10 - 1 = 15.

But in reality, the numerators are numbers co-prime to 9 or 11, which are 15 numbers, but since 99 is 9×11, the number of co-primes is φ(99) = 60.

Wait, that's conflicting.

Wait, perhaps in the smaller case, the number of numerators is 60, but since 99 is 9×11, the φ(99)=60.

But in reality, in the smaller case, the numerators can be numbers co-prime to 9 or 11, but some numbers are co-prime to both, so the total is φ(9) + φ(11) - φ(1) = 6 + 10 - 1 = 15, but actually, the number of numbers co-prime to 99 is 60.

Therefore, perhaps in the smaller case, N is 60, which is φ(99), so similarly, in our original problem, N is φ(9999)=6000.

Therefore, concluding that N=6000.

Thus, 6000 divided by 1000 leaves a remainder of 0.

But wait, the problem statement says "for example, both 4 and 410 are counted as distinct numerators," which are both less than 1000, but in reality, numerators can be up to 9999.

Wait, but 6000 is the number of numerators, each less than or equal to 9999.

But the problem asks for N mod 1000, which is 6000 mod 1000 = 0.

But in the example, 4 and 410 are numerators, which are both less than 1000, but N is 6000, so 0 is the answer.

But perhaps I made a mistake because in the small example, the number of numerators is equal to φ(99)=60, which is 60.

But if I were to compute N mod 1000, 60 mod 1000 is 60.

Wait, but in the problem, the number of numerators is 6000, which mod 1000 is 0.

But wait, perhaps I misapplied the logic.

Wait, in the small example with period 2, the numerators are numbers co-prime to 99, which is 60, so N=60.

Similarly, in our problem, N is φ(9999)=6000.

But wait, in the small example, when reducing fractions k/99, the numerators are co-prime to 99, so N=φ(99)=60.

But in the problem, numerators are co-prime to 9999, so N=φ(9999)=6000.

But then, 6000 mod 1000 is 0.

But in the problem, they mention "distinct numerators", so perhaps 6000 is correct.

But wait, when I think about the small example, 4 is a numerator, but 4 is co-prime to 99. 410 is also a numerator, which is co-prime to 9999.

Wait, in the small example, the numerators are numbers co-prime to 99, which are 60 in number, so N=60.

Similarly, in the main problem, N=6000.

Therefore, the answer is 6000 mod 1000=0.

But let me double-check.

Wait, φ(9999)=6000, correct.

Thus, N=6000.

6000 divided by 1000 is 6, so remainder is 0.

Therefore, the answer is 0.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{0}
</think>

To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of distinct numerators \( N \) when numbers in the set \( S \) are written as irreducible fractions. The set \( S \) consists of all rational numbers that can be expressed as a repeating decimal of the form \( 0.\overline{abcd} \), where \( a, b, c, d \) are digits and at least one is nonzero.

1. **Understanding the Repeating Decimal**: Each number in \( S \) can be written as \( \frac{k}{9999} \) where \( k \) is an integer from 1 to 9999. This is because a repeating decimal with four digits has a period of 4, and the denominator is \( 10^4 - 1 = 9999 \).

2. **Reducing Fractions**: When written as an irreducible fraction, each number \( \frac{k}{9999} \) becomes \( \frac{m}{n} \) where \( m \) is the numerator. Here, \( m \) is \( \frac{k}{\gcd(k, 9999)} \).

3. **Euler's Totient Function**: The number of distinct numerators \( N \) is equivalent to the number of integers \( m \) such that \( m \) is co-prime to 9999. This is given by Euler's totient function \( \phi(9999) \).

4. **Prime Factorization of 9999**: The prime factorization of 9999 is \( 3^2 \times 11 \times 101 \).

5. **Calculating Euler's Totient Function**:
   - For \( 3^2 \): \( \phi(3^2) = 3^2 - 3^1 = 6 \)
   - For \( 11 \): \( \phi(11) = 10 \)
   - For \( 101 \): \( \phi(101) = 100 \)
   - Therefore, \( \phi(9999) = 6 \times 10 \times 100 = 6000 \)

6. **Result**: The number of distinct numerators \( N \) is 6000. The remainder when 6000 is divided by 1000 is 0.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{0}
