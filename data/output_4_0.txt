 The problem: 
Let $S$ be the set of all rational numbers that can be expressed as a repeating decimal in the form $0.\overline{abcd},$ where at least one of the digits $a,$ $b,$ $c,$ or $d$ is nonzero. Let $N$ be the number of distinct numerators obtained when numbers in $S$ are written as fractions in lowest terms. For example, both $4$ and $410$ are counted among the distinct numerators for numbers in $S$ because $0.\overline{3636} = \frac{4}{11}$ and $0.\overline{1230} = \frac{410}{3333}.$ Find the remainder when $N$ is divided by $1000.$


To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of distinct numerators of fractions that represent the set \( S \) of all rational numbers that can be expressed as a repeating decimal in the form \( 0.\overline{abcd} \), where at least one of the digits \( a, b, c, d \) is nonzero. We will then find the remainder when this number is divided by 1000.

First, let's express \( 0.\overline{abcd} \) as a fraction. A repeating decimal \( 0.\overline{abcd} \) can be written as:
\[
0.\overline{abcd} = \frac{abcd}{9999}
\]
where \( abcd \) represents the four-digit number formed by the digits \( a, b, c, \) and \( d \). For example, if \( a = 1, b = 2, c = 3, \) and \( d = 4 \), then \( abcd = 1234 \).

Next, we need to simplify the fraction \( \frac{abcd}{9999} \) to its lowest terms. To do this, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \( abcd \) and 9999. The prime factorization of 9999 is:
\[
9999 = 3^2 \times 11 \times 101
\]

For \( \frac{abcd}{9999} \) to be in its lowest terms, \( abcd \) must not share any prime factors with 9999. Therefore, \( abcd \) must not be divisible by 3, 11, or 101.

We now count the number of four-digit numbers \( abcd \) that are not divisible by 3, 11, or 101. First, we calculate the total number of four-digit numbers:
\[
9999 - 1000 + 1 = 9000
\]

Next, we use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to count the number of four-digit numbers that are divisible by 3, 11, or 101.

1. **Divisible by 3:**
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{9999}{3} \right\rfloor - \left\lfloor \frac{999}{3} \right\rfloor = 3333 - 333 = 3000
\]

2. **Divisible by 11:**
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{9999}{11} \right\rfloor - \left\lfloor \frac{99}{11} \right\rfloor = 909 - 9 = 899
\]

3. **Divisible by 101:**
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{9999}{101} \right\rfloor - \left\lfloor \frac{99}{101} \right\rfloor = 99 - 0 = 99
\]

4. **Divisible by \( 3 \times 11 = 33 \):**
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{9999}{33} \right\rfloor - \left\lfloor \frac{99}{33} \right\rfloor = 303 - 3 = 299
\]

5. **Divisible by \( 3 \times 101 = 303 \):**
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{9999}{303} \right\rfloor - \left\lfloor \frac{99}{303} \right\rfloor = 33 - 0 = 33
\]

6. **Divisible by \( 11 \times 101 = 1111 \):**
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{9999}{1111} \right\rfloor - \left\lfloor \frac{99}{1111} \right\rfloor = 9 - 0 = 9
\]

7. **Divisible by \( 3 \times 11 \times 101 = 3333 \):**
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{9999}{3333} \right\rfloor - \left\lfloor \frac{99}{3333} \right\rfloor = 3 - 0 = 3
\]

Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, the number of four-digit numbers divisible by 3, 11, or 101 is:
\[
3000 + 899 + 99 - 299 - 33 - 9 + 3 = 3600
\]

Thus, the number of four-digit numbers not divisible by 3, 11, or 101 is:
\[
9000 - 3600 = 5400
\]

Finally, the number of distinct numerators obtained when numbers in \( S \) are written as fractions in lowest terms is 5400. The remainder when 5400 is divided by 1000 is:
\[
\boxed{400}
\]
