 The problem: 
For any finite set $X$, let $| X |$ denote the number of elements in $X$. Define
\[S_n = \sum | A \cap B | ,\]
where the sum is taken over all ordered pairs $(A, B)$ such that $A$ and $B$ are subsets of $\left\{ 1 , 2 , 3,  \cdots , n \right\}$ with $|A| = |B|$.
For example, $S_2 = 4$ because the sum is taken over the pairs of subsets
\[(A, B) \in \left\{ (\emptyset, \emptyset) , ( \{1\} , \{1\} ), ( \{1\} , \{2\} ) , ( \{2\} , \{1\} ) , ( \{2\} , \{2\} ) , ( \{1 , 2\} , \{1 , 2\} ) \right\} ,\]
giving $S_2 = 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 2 = 4$.
Let $\frac{S_{2022}}{S_{2021}} = \frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find the remainder when $p + q$ is divided by
1000.


To solve for \( S_n \), we start by considering the sum \( S_n = \sum | A \cap B | \) over all ordered pairs \((A, B)\) where \(A\) and \(B\) are subsets of \(\{1, 2, \ldots, n\}\) with \(|A| = |B|\).

First, we note that for a fixed subset \(A\) of size \(k\), the number of subsets \(B\) of size \(k\) is \(\binom{n}{k}\). For each such pair \((A, B)\), the term \(|A \cap B|\) contributes to the sum. To find the total contribution of \(|A \cap B|\) over all possible pairs \((A, B)\), we need to count how many times each element \(i\) appears in the intersection \(A \cap B\).

For a fixed element \(i\), the probability that \(i\) is in a randomly chosen subset \(A\) of size \(k\) is \(\frac{k}{n}\). Similarly, the probability that \(i\) is in a randomly chosen subset \(B\) of size \(k\) is also \(\frac{k}{n}\). Therefore, the probability that \(i\) is in both \(A\) and \(B\) is \(\left(\frac{k}{n}\right)^2 = \frac{k^2}{n^2}\). Since there are \(\binom{n}{k}\) choices for \(A\) and \(\binom{n}{k}\) choices for \(B\), the expected number of times \(i\) appears in the intersection \(A \cap B\) is \(\binom{n}{k}^2 \cdot \frac{k^2}{n^2}\).

Summing this over all possible values of \(k\) from 0 to \(n\), we get:
\[
S_n = \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k}^2 \cdot \frac{k^2}{n^2} = \frac{1}{n^2} \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k}^2 k^2.
\]

Using the identity \(\sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k}^2 k^2 = n^2 2^{n-2} + n 2^{n-1}\), we have:
\[
S_n = \frac{1}{n^2} \left( n^2 2^{n-2} + n 2^{n-1} \right) = 2^{n-2} + \frac{2^{n-1}}{n}.
\]

For \(n = 2022\), we get:
\[
S_{2022} = 2^{2020} + \frac{2^{2021}}{2022} = 2^{2020} \left(1 + \frac{2}{2022}\right) = 2^{2020} \left(\frac{2024}{2022}\right) = 2^{2020} \cdot \frac{1012}{1011}.
\]

For \(n = 2021\), we get:
\[
S_{2021} = 2^{2020} + \frac{2^{2020}}{2021} = 2^{2020} \left(1 + \frac{1}{2021}\right) = 2^{2020} \cdot \frac{2022}{2021}.
\]

Thus, we have:
\[
\frac{S_{2022}}{S_{2021}} = \frac{2^{2020} \cdot \frac{1012}{1011}}{2^{2020} \cdot \frac{2022}{2021}} = \frac{1012 \cdot 2021}{1011 \cdot 2022} = \frac{1012 \cdot 2021}{1011 \cdot 2022} = \frac{1012 \cdot 2021}{1011 \cdot 2022} = \frac{1012}{1011} \cdot \frac{2021}{2022}.
\]

Since 1012 and 1011 are relatively prime, and 2021 and 2022 are relatively prime, the fraction is already in its simplest form. Therefore, \(p = 1012\) and \(q = 1011 \cdot 2022 / 2021 = 1011\), so \(p + q = 1012 + 1011 = 2023\).

The remainder when 2023 is divided by 1000 is:
\[
\boxed{23}.
