 The problem: 
In isosceles trapezoid $ABCD$, parallel bases $\overline{AB}$ and $\overline{CD}$ have lengths $500$ and $650$, respectively, and $AD=BC=333$. The angle bisectors of $\angle{A}$ and $\angle{D}$ meet at $P$, and the angle bisectors of $\angle{B}$ and $\angle{C}$ meet at $Q$. Find $PQ$.


To solve for \(PQ\) in the isosceles trapezoid \(ABCD\), we start by analyzing the geometry of the trapezoid. The lengths of the bases are \(AB = 500\) and \(CD = 650\), and the non-parallel sides are \(AD = BC = 333\).

First, we find the height of the trapezoid. Drop perpendiculars from points \(A\) and \(B\) to line \(CD\), meeting \(CD\) at points \(E\) and \(F\) respectively. Since \(AB\) is parallel to \(CD\) and \(AE\) and \(BF\) are heights, \(AE = BF\). The segment \(EF\) is equal to the length of \(AB\), so \(EF = 500\). This means that the segments \(DE\) and \(CF\) are each \(\frac{650 - 500}{2} = 75\).

Now, consider the right triangle \(ADE\). Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the height \(h\) of the trapezoid:
\[
h = \sqrt{AD^2 - DE^2} = \sqrt{333^2 - 75^2} = \sqrt{110889 - 5625} = \sqrt{105264} = 324.
\]

Next, we need to find the coordinates of points \(P\) and \(Q\). The angle bisectors of \(\angle A\) and \(\angle D\) meet at point \(P\), and the angle bisectors of \(\angle B\) and \(\angle C\) meet at point \(Q\). In an isosceles trapezoid, the angle bisectors of the angles at the non-parallel sides intersect on the perpendicular bisector of the line segment joining the midpoints of the bases. This perpendicular bisector is also the line segment joining the midpoints of the bases.

The distance between the midpoints of the bases \(AB\) and \(CD\) is the height of the trapezoid, which is 324. Since \(P\) and \(Q\) are on this line segment, the distance \(PQ\) is equal to the height of the trapezoid. Therefore, the length of \(PQ\) is:
\[
PQ = 324.
\]

Thus, the answer is:
\[
\boxed{324}.
\]
