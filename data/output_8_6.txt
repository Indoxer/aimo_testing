 The problem: 
In isosceles trapezoid $ABCD$, parallel bases $\overline{AB}$ and $\overline{CD}$ have lengths $500$ and $650$, respectively, and $AD=BC=333$. The angle bisectors of $\angle{A}$ and $\angle{D}$ meet at $P$, and the angle bisectors of $\angle{B}$ and $\angle{C}$ meet at $Q$. Find $PQ$.


To find the length \(PQ\) in the given isosceles trapezoid \(ABCD\), we start by analyzing the geometry of the trapezoid. The lengths of the bases are \(AB = 500\) and \(CD = 650\), and the non-parallel sides are \(AD = BC = 333\).

First, we drop perpendiculars from points \(A\) and \(B\) to line \(CD\), meeting \(CD\) at points \(E\) and \(F\) respectively. This creates two right triangles, \(\triangle ADE\) and \(\triangle BCF\), and a rectangle \(ABFE\). Since \(AB = EF = 500\), the segments \(DE\) and \(CF\) are equal, and their sum is the difference between the lengths of the bases:
\[ DE + CF = CD - AB = 650 - 500 = 150. \]
Since \(DE = CF\), we have:
\[ DE = CF = \frac{150}{2} = 75. \]

Next, we use the Pythagorean theorem in \(\triangle ADE\) to find the height \(h\) of the trapezoid:
\[ AD^2 = AE^2 + DE^2 \implies 333^2 = h^2 + 75^2 \implies 110889 = h^2 + 5625 \implies h^2 = 105264 \implies h = \sqrt{105264} = 324.44. \]

Now, we need to find the coordinates of points \(P\) and \(Q\). Since \(P\) is the intersection of the angle bisectors of \(\angle A\) and \(\angle D\), and \(Q\) is the intersection of the angle bisectors of \(\angle B\) and \(\angle C\), both \(P\) and \(Q\) lie on the line that is the perpendicular bisector of \(AB\) and parallel to \(AB\) and \(CD\). This line is at a distance of \(h/2 = 162.22\) from \(AB\) and \(CD\).

The distance \(PQ\) is simply the distance between these two parallel lines, which is equal to the height of the trapezoid:
\[ PQ = h = 324.44. \]

However, since we are asked to find the exact value, we use the simplified form of the height calculated earlier:
\[ PQ = 324. \]

Thus, the length \(PQ\) is:
\[ \boxed{324}. \]
