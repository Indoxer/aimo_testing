 The problem: 
In isosceles trapezoid $ABCD$, parallel bases $\overline{AB}$ and $\overline{CD}$ have lengths $500$ and $650$, respectively, and $AD=BC=333$. The angle bisectors of $\angle{A}$ and $\angle{D}$ meet at $P$, and the angle bisectors of $\angle{B}$ and $\angle{C}$ meet at $Q$. Find $PQ$.


To solve for \(PQ\) in the isosceles trapezoid \(ABCD\) with given dimensions, we start by understanding the geometric properties and relationships within the trapezoid.

First, let's denote the lengths of the bases and the non-parallel sides:
- \(AB = 500\)
- \(CD = 650\)
- \(AD = BC = 333\)

Since \(ABCD\) is an isosceles trapezoid, the angles \(\angle A\) and \(\angle D\) are equal, and the angles \(\angle B\) and \(\angle C\) are equal. Let's denote \(\angle A = \angle D = \alpha\) and \(\angle B = \angle C = \beta\).

The angle bisectors of \(\angle A\) and \(\angle D\) meet at point \(P\), and the angle bisectors of \(\angle B\) and \(\angle C\) meet at point \(Q\). Because the trapezoid is isosceles, the angle bisectors of the angles at the bases will intersect at points that are equidistant from the midpoints of the bases.

To find the distance \(PQ\), we need to determine the height of the trapezoid. Let's drop perpendiculars from points \(A\) and \(B\) to line \(CD\), meeting \(CD\) at points \(E\) and \(F\) respectively. This creates two right triangles, \(\triangle ADE\) and \(\triangle BCF\), and a rectangle \(ABFE\).

The length of \(EF\) is equal to the length of \(AB\), which is 500. Therefore, the lengths of \(DE\) and \(CF\) are each \(\frac{650 - 500}{2} = 75\).

Now, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the height \(h\) of the trapezoid:
\[
h = \sqrt{333^2 - 75^2} = \sqrt{110889 - 5625} = \sqrt{105264} = 324
\]

The distance \(PQ\) is equal to the height of the trapezoid because \(P\) and \(Q\) are located directly above and below the midpoint of the height of the trapezoid, respectively. Therefore, the distance \(PQ\) is simply the height of the trapezoid.

Thus, the length of \(PQ\) is:
\[
\boxed{324}
\]
