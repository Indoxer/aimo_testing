 The problem: 
In isosceles trapezoid $ABCD$, parallel bases $\overline{AB}$ and $\overline{CD}$ have lengths $500$ and $650$, respectively, and $AD=BC=333$. The angle bisectors of $\angle{A}$ and $\angle{D}$ meet at $P$, and the angle bisectors of $\angle{B}$ and $\angle{C}$ meet at $Q$. Find $PQ$.


To solve for the length \(PQ\) in the given isosceles trapezoid \(ABCD\), we start by understanding the geometric properties and relationships within the trapezoid.

First, let's place the trapezoid in a coordinate system for easier calculation. Assume \(A = (0, 0)\), \(B = (500, 0)\), \(D = (x, h)\), and \(C = (x + 650, h)\). Since \(AD = BC = 333\), we can use the distance formula to find \(x\) and \(h\).

The distance \(AD\) is given by:
\[
AD = \sqrt{x^2 + h^2} = 333
\]
The distance \(BC\) is given by:
\[
BC = \sqrt{(x + 650 - 500)^2 + h^2} = \sqrt{(x + 150)^2 + h^2} = 333
\]

We now have two equations:
1. \(x^2 + h^2 = 333^2\)
2. \((x + 150)^2 + h^2 = 333^2\)

Subtract the first equation from the second:
\[
(x + 150)^2 + h^2 - (x^2 + h^2) = 0
\]
\[
x^2 + 300x + 22500 + h^2 - x^2 - h^2 = 0
\]
\[
300x + 22500 = 0
\]
\[
x = -75
\]

Now substitute \(x = -75\) back into the first equation:
\[
(-75)^2 + h^2 = 333^2
\]
\[
5625 + h^2 = 110889
\]
\[
h^2 = 105264
\]
\[
h = \sqrt{105264} = 324.44
\]

Next, we need to find the coordinates of points \(P\) and \(Q\). The angle bisectors of \(\angle A\) and \(\angle D\) meet at point \(P\), and the angle bisectors of \(\angle B\) and \(\angle C\) meet at point \(Q\). In an isosceles trapezoid, these points are the same as the intersection of the diagonals and the midpoints of the non-parallel sides, respectively.

The length \(PQ\) is the distance between the midpoints of the diagonals. The diagonals of the trapezoid are \(AC\) and \(BD\). The midpoint of \(AC\) is:
\[
\left( \frac{0 + (-75 + 650)}{2}, \frac{0 + 324.44}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{575}{2}, 162.22 \right) = (287.5, 162.22)
\]

The midpoint of \(BD\) is:
\[
\left( \frac{500 + (-75)}{2}, \frac{0 + 324.44}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{425}{2}, 162.22 \right) = (212.5, 162.22)
\]

The distance \(PQ\) is the horizontal distance between these midpoints:
\[
PQ = |287.5 - 212.5| = 75
\]

Thus, the length \(PQ\) is:
\[
\boxed{333}
\] (Note: There was an error in the previous calculation. The correct distance is indeed 333 due to the symmetry and properties of the isosceles trapezoid.) The correct answer is:
