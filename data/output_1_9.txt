 The problem: 
Three spheres with radii $11$, $13$, and $19$ are mutually externally tangent. A plane intersects the spheres in three congruent circles centered at $A$, $B$, and $C$, respectively, and the centers of the spheres all lie on the same side of this plane. Suppose that $AB^2 = 560$. Find $AC^2$.


To solve for \(AC^2\), we start by understanding the geometric configuration of the spheres and the plane. Let's denote the centers of the spheres as \(O_1\), \(O_2\), and \(O_3\) with radii \(11\), \(13\), and \(19\) respectively. The plane intersects the spheres in three congruent circles centered at \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\) respectively.

Since the circles are congruent, the distances from the centers of the spheres to the plane are equal. Let the distance from \(O_1\) to the plane be \(d_1\), from \(O_2\) to the plane be \(d_2\), and from \(O_3\) to the plane be \(d_3\). The radii of the circles are given by:
\[ r_1 = \sqrt{11^2 - d_1^2} = \sqrt{121 - d_1^2}, \]
\[ r_2 = \sqrt{13^2 - d_2^2} = \sqrt{169 - d_2^2}, \]
\[ r_3 = \sqrt{19^2 - d_3^2} = \sqrt{361 - d_3^2}. \]

Since the circles are congruent, we have:
\[ \sqrt{121 - d_1^2} = \sqrt{169 - d_2^2} = \sqrt{361 - d_3^2} = r. \]

The distance between the centers of the spheres is the sum of their radii because they are mutually externally tangent:
\[ O_1O_2 = 11 + 13 = 24, \]
\[ O_1O_3 = 11 + 19 = 30, \]
\[ O_2O_3 = 13 + 19 = 32. \]

The distance between the centers of the spheres projected onto the plane is the distance between the centers of the circles, which is \(2r\) because the circles are congruent. Therefore, we have:
\[ AB^2 = (O_1O_2)^2 - (2r)^2 = 24^2 - (2r)^2 = 576 - 4r^2 = 560. \]
Solving for \(r^2\), we get:
\[ 576 - 4r^2 = 560, \]
\[ 4r^2 = 16, \]
\[ r^2 = 4. \]

Now, we need to find \(AC^2\):
\[ AC^2 = (O_1O_3)^2 - (2r)^2 = 30^2 - (2r)^2 = 900 - 4r^2 = 900 - 16 = 884. \]

Thus, the value of \(AC^2\) is:
\[ \boxed{884}. \]
