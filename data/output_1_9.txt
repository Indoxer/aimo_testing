 The problem: 
Three spheres with radii $11$, $13$, and $19$ are mutually externally tangent. A plane intersects the spheres in three congruent circles centered at $A$, $B$, and $C$, respectively, and the centers of the spheres all lie on the same side of this plane. Suppose that $AB^2 = 560$. Find $AC^2$.


To solve the problem, we start by visualizing the setup. We have three spheres with radii \( r_1 = 11 \), \( r_2 = 13 \), and \( r_3 = 19 \) that are mutually externally tangent. A plane intersects these spheres in three congruent circles centered at points \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) respectively.

First, let's denote the centers of the spheres as \( O_1 \), \( O_2 \), and \( O_3 \). Since the spheres are mutually externally tangent, the distances between their centers are:
\[
O_1O_2 = r_1 + r_2 = 11 + 13 = 24,
\]
\[
O_2O_3 = r_2 + r_3 = 13 + 19 = 32,
\]
\[
O_3O_1 = r_3 + r_1 = 19 + 11 = 30.
\]

Next, consider the plane that intersects the spheres. Let the distances from the centers \( O_1 \), \( O_2 \), and \( O_3 \) to the plane be \( d_1 \), \( d_2 \), and \( d_3 \) respectively. The radii of the circles formed by the intersection of the plane with the spheres are given by:
\[
r_1^2 - d_1^2 = r_2^2 - d_2^2 = r_3^2 - d_3^2.
\]

Let \( R \) be the common radius of these circles. Then:
\[
R^2 = r_1^2 - d_1^2 = r_2^2 - d_2^2 = r_3^2 - d_3^2.
\]

We are given that \( AB^2 = 560 \). The distance \( AB \) is the distance between the centers of the circles \( A \) and \( B \) on the plane. Using the Pythagorean theorem in the plane, we have:
\[
AB^2 = (d_1 - d_2)^2 + R^2.
\]

Substituting \( R^2 \) from the earlier equation:
\[
AB^2 = (d_1 - d_2)^2 + (r_1^2 - d_1^2).
\]

Simplifying:
\[
560 = (d_1 - d_2)^2 + (11^2 - d_1^2).
\]
\[
560 = (d_1 - d_2)^2 + 121 - d_1^2.
\]
\[
560 = d_1^2 - 2d_1d_2 + d_2^2 + 121 - d_1^2.
\]
\[
560 = d_2^2 - 2d_1d_2 + 121.
\]
\[
439 = d_2^2 - 2d_1d_2.
\]

Similarly, for \( AC^2 \):
\[
AC^2 = (d_1 - d_3)^2 + R^2.
\]
\[
AC^2 = (d_1 - d_3)^2 + (11^2 - d_1^2).
\]
\[
AC^2 = (d_1 - d_3)^2 + 121 - d_1^2.
\]
\[
AC^2 = d_1^2 - 2d_1d_3 + d_3^2 + 121 - d_1^2.
\]
\[
AC^2 = d_3^2 - 2d_1d_3 + 121.
\]

Using the fact that \( AB^2 = 560 \) and solving for \( d_1 \) and \( d_2 \), we find:
\[
d_2^2 - 2d_1d_2 = 439.
\]

Since \( AB^2 = 560 \) and \( AC^2 = 560 \), we conclude:
\[
AC^2 = 560.
\]

Thus, the value of \( AC^2 \) is:
\[
\boxed{560}.
\] 

This solution involves using the properties of tangency and the Pythagorean theorem to find the required distances and radii. The key insight is recognizing the congruence of the circles formed by the intersections and using the given information to solve for the unknowns. The final answer is obtained by ensuring consistency with the given conditions and the geometric properties of the problem. The final boxed answer is \( \boxed{560} \).
