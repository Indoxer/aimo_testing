 The problem: 
For any finite set $X$, let $| X |$ denote the number of elements in $X$. Define
\[S_n = \sum | A \cap B | ,\]
where the sum is taken over all ordered pairs $(A, B)$ such that $A$ and $B$ are subsets of $\left\{ 1 , 2 , 3,  \cdots , n \right\}$ with $|A| = |B|$.
For example, $S_2 = 4$ because the sum is taken over the pairs of subsets
\[(A, B) \in \left\{ (\emptyset, \emptyset) , ( \{1\} , \{1\} ), ( \{1\} , \{2\} ) , ( \{2\} , \{1\} ) , ( \{2\} , \{2\} ) , ( \{1 , 2\} , \{1 , 2\} ) \right\} ,\]
giving $S_2 = 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 2 = 4$.
Let $\frac{S_{2022}}{S_{2021}} = \frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find the remainder when $p + q$ is divided by
1000.


To solve for \( S_n \), we need to consider the sum of the sizes of the intersections of all pairs of subsets of \(\{1, 2, \ldots, n\}\) of the same size. Let's start by understanding the structure of the problem.

For a fixed subset \( A \) of size \( k \), there are \(\binom{n}{k}\) ways to choose \( A \). For each such \( A \), there are \(\binom{n}{k}\) ways to choose another subset \( B \) of the same size. Therefore, the total number of ordered pairs \((A, B)\) is \(\binom{n}{k}^2\).

Now, we need to count how many times each element \( i \) of \(\{1, 2, \ldots, n\}\) appears in the intersection \( A \cap B \). For a fixed element \( i \), the number of subsets \( A \) containing \( i \) and of size \( k \) is \(\binom{n-1}{k-1}\). Similarly, the number of subsets \( B \) containing \( i \) and of size \( k \) is also \(\binom{n-1}{k-1}\). Therefore, the number of ordered pairs \((A, B)\) where \( i \) is in both \( A \) and \( B \) is \(\binom{n-1}{k-1}^2\).

Summing this over all possible values of \( k \) from 0 to \( n \), we get:
\[
S_n = \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k}^2 \binom{n-1}{k-1}^2.
\]

We can simplify this expression using the identity \(\binom{n}{k} = \binom{n}{n-k}\) and the fact that \(\binom{n-1}{k-1} = \binom{n-1}{n-k}\). This allows us to rewrite the sum as:
\[
S_n = \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k}^2 \binom{n-1}{k-1}^2 = \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k}^2 \binom{n-1}{n-k}^2.
\]

Using the identity \(\binom{n}{k} = \binom{n}{n-k}\), we can see that the sum is symmetric. Therefore, we can shift the index of summation to get:
\[
S_n = \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k}^2 \binom{n-1}{k}^2 = \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k}^2 \binom{n-1}{n-k}^2.
\]

This sum can be simplified using the fact that \(\binom{n}{k} = \binom{n}{n-k}\) and the symmetry of the binomial coefficients. The result is:
\[
S_n = \binom{2n}{n}^2.
\]

Therefore, we have:
\[
S_{2022} = \binom{4044}{2022}^2 \quad \text{and} \quad S_{2021} = \binom{4042}{2021}^2.
\]

The ratio \(\frac{S_{2022}}{S_{2021}}\) is then:
\[
\frac{S_{2022}}{S_{2021}} = \frac{\binom{4044}{2022}^2}{\binom{4042}{2021}^2} = \frac{\left( \frac{4044!}{2022! 2022!} \right)^2}{\left( \frac{4042!}{2021! 2021!} \right)^2} = \left( \frac{4044 \cdot 4043}{2022 \cdot 2022} \right)^2 = \left( \frac{4044 \cdot 4043}{2022^2} \right)^2 = 4.
\]

Thus, we have \(\frac{S_{2022}}{S_{2021}} = \frac{4}{1}\), so \( p = 4 \) and \( q = 1 \). The remainder when \( p + q = 5 \) is divided by 1000 is:
\[
\boxed{5}.
\]```python
def solve():
    # Calculate S_n for n = 2022 and n = 2021
    S_2022 = binomial(4044, 2022) ** 2
    S_2021 = binomial(4042, 2021) ** 2

    # Calculate the ratio S_2022 / S_2021
    ratio = S_2022 / S_2021

    # Simplify the ratio to its lowest terms
    from fractions import Fraction
    ratio_fraction = Fraction(ratio).limit_denominator()

    # Extract p and q from the fraction
    p, q = ratio_fraction.numerator, ratio_fraction.denominator

    # Calculate the remainder of p + q when divided by 1000
    result = (p + q) % 1000

    return result

# Print the result

```
```output

```
The remainder when \( p + q \) is divided by 1000 is \(\boxed{5}\).
