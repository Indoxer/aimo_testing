 The problem: 
For any finite set $X$, let $| X |$ denote the number of elements in $X$. Define
\[S_n = \sum | A \cap B | ,\]
where the sum is taken over all ordered pairs $(A, B)$ such that $A$ and $B$ are subsets of $\left\{ 1 , 2 , 3,  \cdots , n \right\}$ with $|A| = |B|$.
For example, $S_2 = 4$ because the sum is taken over the pairs of subsets
\[(A, B) \in \left\{ (\emptyset, \emptyset) , ( \{1\} , \{1\} ), ( \{1\} , \{2\} ) , ( \{2\} , \{1\} ) , ( \{2\} , \{2\} ) , ( \{1 , 2\} , \{1 , 2\} ) \right\} ,\]
giving $S_2 = 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 2 = 4$.
Let $\frac{S_{2022}}{S_{2021}} = \frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find the remainder when $p + q$ is divided by
1000.


To find \( S_n \), we start by considering the sum \( S_n = \sum |A \cap B| \) over all ordered pairs \((A, B)\) where \( A \) and \( B \) are subsets of \(\{1, 2, \ldots, n\}\) with \( |A| = |B| \). We will first count the contribution of each element \( i \) to the sum \( S_n \).

For a fixed element \( i \), we need to count how many times \( i \) appears in the intersection \( A \cap B \). This happens if and only if \( i \) is in both \( A \) and \( B \). If \( |A| = |B| = k \), then there are \(\binom{n-1}{k-1}\) ways to choose the remaining elements of \( A \) and \( B \) after including \( i \). Therefore, for each fixed \( k \), the number of pairs \((A, B)\) such that \( i \in A \cap B \) and \( |A| = |B| = k \) is \(\binom{n-1}{k-1}^2\).

Summing over all possible values of \( k \) from 0 to \( n \), we get:
\[
S_n = \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n-1}{k-1}^2.
\]
However, we need to adjust the index to start from 1 instead of 0, so we have:
\[
S_n = \sum_{k=1}^n \binom{n-1}{k-1}^2 = \sum_{j=0}^{n-1} \binom{n-1}{j}^2,
\]
where we have made the substitution \( j = k-1 \). By the identity \(\sum_{j=0}^{m} \binom{m}{j}^2 = \binom{2m}{m}\), we get:
\[
S_n = \binom{2(n-1)}{n-1}.
\]

Now, we need to find \( \frac{S_{2022}}{S_{2021}} \):
\[
\frac{S_{2022}}{S_{2021}} = \frac{\binom{2 \cdot 2021}{2021}}{\binom{2 \cdot 2020}{2020}} = \frac{\binom{4042}{2021}}{\binom{4040}{2020}}.
\]
Using the property of binomial coefficients \(\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\), we can simplify this expression:
\[
\frac{\binom{4042}{2021}}{\binom{4040}{2020}} = \frac{\frac{4042!}{2021!2021!}}{\frac{4040!}{2020!2020!}} = \frac{4042 \cdot 4041}{2021 \cdot 2021} = \frac{4042 \cdot 4041}{2021^2} = \frac{4042 \cdot 4041}{4084441} = \frac{4042 \cdot 4041}{4042^2} = \frac{4041}{2021}.
\]
Thus, \( p = 4041 \) and \( q = 2021 \), and we need to find the remainder when \( p + q = 4041 + 2021 = 6062 \) is divided by 1000:
\[
6062 \mod 1000 = 62.
\]
Therefore, the answer is:
\[
\boxed{62}.
\]
