 The problem: 
A list of positive integers has the following properties:
$\bullet$ The sum of the items in the list is $30$.
$\bullet$ The unique mode of the list is $9$.
$\bullet$ The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself.
Find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.


<think>
Okay, so I have this problem where there's a list of positive integers with some specific properties. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the sum of all the items in the list is 30. That means if I add up every number in the list, it equals 30. Got that.

Second, the unique mode of the list is 9. Mode means the number that appears most frequently, right? And it says it's unique, so 9 appears more times than any other number in the list. So, for example, if 9 appears three times, then no other number can appear three or more times. Also, since it's the mode, at least two numbers must be present because otherwise, all numbers would be unique, and you can't have a mode unless at least two of them are the same. Wait, actually, no, in a list with only one element, the mode is that element. But here, since 9 is the unique mode, we know it appears at least twice, and more than any other number. So, maybe 9 appears three or four times?

Third, the median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself. Hmm, the median is the middle value when the numbers are arranged in order. If the list has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle one; if even, it's the average of the two middle ones. But wait, the median is specified as a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list. So, it's not just any number; it's an integer and it's not in the list. That gives me some constraints on how the list is structured.

So, my goal is to find such a list, figure out each number, and then compute the sum of their squares.

Let me think about possible lengths of the list first. Since the sum is 30, which isn't too large, but the length could vary. Let's consider different cases based on the number of elements.

But before that, let's recall what the median requires. For the median to be a positive integer not in the list, the number of elements must be such that the median is either the middle element (if odd) or the average of two middle elements (if even). However, in both cases, the median needs to be an integer, meaning that if it's an average, the two middle numbers must add up to an even number so that their average is an integer.

Also, since the median is not in the list, that tells us something about the structure of the list. For example, if the median is the average of two middle numbers, those two numbers themselves don't have to be the median, but their average is the median, which isn't in the list.

Let me see. Maybe starting with small lists? But if the list is too short, say 2 elements, but then the median would be the average of the two, which might have to be an integer. But if the list is of even length, like 4, the median is the average of the second and third numbers.

Wait, hold on. Let me consider the number of elements, n, in the list. The median will be different depending on whether n is odd or even.

If n is odd, the median is the (n+1)/2 th term. So, for example, n=5, median is the 3rd term. In that case, the 3rd term is equal to the median, but the problem says the median does not appear in the list. So, if n is odd, the median is equal to the middle term, which would mean that the median is in the list. But the problem states it's not in the list. Therefore, n cannot be odd. Because if n is odd, the median is the middle term, hence present in the list, which contradicts the given condition. So, n must be even.

Therefore, the list must have an even number of elements. Let's denote n = 2k, where k is an integer greater than 1 (since for n=2, the median is the average of the two numbers, which may or may not be an integer).

So, n is even, say n=2k. Then, the median is the average of the kth and (k+1)th terms. Since the median is a positive integer, that average must be an integer. Therefore, the sum of the kth and (k+1)th terms must be even.

Furthermore, the median is not present in the list. So, the average of the kth and (k+1)th terms is not equal to either of those terms.

Hence, the two middle terms must be distinct, and their average is another integer not equal to either of them.

Got it.

Now, considering the mode is 9. So, 9 must appear more times than any other number. Let me think about how many times 9 can appear.

Since it's the unique mode, suppose 9 appears m times. Then, no other number can appear m or more times. So, if m=2, then no other number can appear twice or more—i.e., all other numbers must appear once. If m=3, then no other number can appear three or more times, etc.

Given that the total sum is 30, and 9 is repeated multiple times, let's try to estimate m.

Suppose m=2. Then, we have two 9s, and the rest of the numbers are unique. The sum contributed by the 9s is 18. Then, the remaining sum is 12, spread over the remaining n-2 numbers, each appearing once. So, the total number of elements would be n = 2 + number_of_other_numbers. Since the rest of the numbers sum to 12, they must be positive integers. To minimize the number of elements, we want the other numbers to be as large as possible. The maximum possible is 12, but that would make the list [9,9,12], which has n=3, but earlier we concluded n must be even. So, n cannot be 3.

Alternatively, if m=2, then n must be even. So, n could be 4,6,8,... Let's test for n=4.

Case 1: n=4

We have two 9s, contributing 18. Remaining sum is 12, over two numbers. Since n=4, the other two numbers must be positive integers, summing to 12. Also, these numbers cannot include 9, because 9 is already the mode, appearing twice, so any other number can appear at most once.

So, let's call them a and b, with a + b = 12, and a ≠ b, and neither a nor b equal to 9.

Possible pairs:

(1,11), (2,10), (3,9) → but 9 is excluded, so (3,9) invalid.

Similarly, (4,8), (5,7), (6,6). But 6,6 would make 6 appear twice, which is allowed, as long as 9 appears more.

Wait, but in this case, if m=2, 9 appears twice, and 6 appears twice, then the mode wouldn't be unique—it would be both 9 and 6. But the problem says the unique mode is 9, so 6 can't appear twice. So, (6,6) is invalid.

Thus, possible pairs: (1,11), (2,10), (4,8), (5,7)

So, for example, the list could be [9,9,1,11]. Let's check the median.

Since n=4, the median is average of 2nd and 3rd terms. Let's arrange the list in order: [1,9,9,11]. So, the 2nd and 3rd terms are 9 and 9. Their average is 9. But the median is 9, which is in the list. But according to the problem statement, the median should not be in the list. So, this doesn't work.

Similarly, let's take another pair, say (2,10). The list would be [2,9,9,10]. Arranged: [2,9,9,10]. Median is (9+9)/2=9, which is in the list. Again, violates the condition.

Same with (4,8): [4,8,9,9] → median is (8+9)/2=8.5, which is not an integer. But the problem says the median is a positive integer. So, 8.5 is not acceptable. So, this case is invalid.

Wait, hold on, the median is supposed to be an integer. So, in the case of n=4, the median is the average of the 2nd and 3rd terms, which must be an integer. So, in our previous case, [9,9,1,11], sorted as [1,9,9,11], the 2nd and 3rd terms are both 9, so their average is 9, which is in the list. Not good.

Another option, [2,9,9,10]: sorted as [2,9,9,10], again, the average is 9, which is present. Similarly, [4,8,9,9] would be sorted as [4,8,9,9], the average is (8+9)/2=8.5, not integer. So, no good.

What about [5,7,9,9]? Sorted: [5,7,9,9]. The average is (7+9)/2=8, which is not in the list. So, 8 is the median, and it's not in the list. So, that seems okay.

So, the list would be [5,7,9,9], sum is 5+7+9+9=30. The mode is 9, unique. The median is 8, which is not in the list. So, that works.

Wait, is that correct? Let's double-check. The list is [5,7,9,9]. Sum is 5+7+9+9=30. Correct. The mode is 9, unique because it appears twice, others once. Median is the average of 7 and 9, which is 8. 8 is not in the list. Perfect.

So, this seems to satisfy all conditions. Now, is this the only possibility? Let's check other pairs.

For example, (1,11) gives [1,11,9,9], same as above. The median is 8, same thing.

(2,10) gives [2,10,9,9], sorted as [2,9,9,10]. The median is (9+9)/2=9, which is in the list—invalid.

(4,8) as before, leads to non-integer median.

(5,7) gives [5,7,9,9], which works.

Is there another possible list with n=4?

Well, suppose instead of having two 9s, we have three 9s. Then, the sum contributed by 9s is 27, leaving 3 for the remaining number(s). Since n=4, the remaining number is 3. So, the list would be [3,9,9,9]. Sorted: [3,9,9,9]. The median is the average of 9 and 9, which is 9, present in the list. So, invalid.

Alternatively, n=6. Let's try n=6.

If n=6, the median is the average of the 3rd and 4th terms. So, their average must be an integer, and not present in the list.

Since the mode is 9, appearing more times than any other number. So, let's assume 9 appears three times, as that's a common minimum for being a unique mode.

So, three 9s contribute 27. The remaining sum is 3, spread over 3 numbers (since n=6, 3 remaining numbers). So, each of those would have to be 1, since they're positive integers. So, the list would be [1,1,1,9,9,9]. Sum is 3+27=30.

But wait, in this case, the mode is 1, because it appears three times as well. So, the unique mode is supposed to be 9, but now 1 also appears three times, making it another mode. So, that's invalid.

Alternatively, maybe 9 appears four times. Then, the sum contributed by 9s is 36, which is more than 30, so that's impossible.

Alternatively, perhaps 9 appears three times, and the remaining sum is 3 over three numbers. So, those numbers could be 1,1,1—but that causes the mode to be 1, which conflicts. Or 1,1,1, but same issue.

Alternatively, maybe 9 appears twice. Then, the sum contributed by 9s is 18, leaving 12 over four numbers. Each of those numbers must be unique, since 9 is appearing twice, so other numbers can appear at most once.

So, four numbers adding up to 12, all distinct positive integers. What's the minimal set? 1,2,3,6; sum is 12. Alternatively, 1,2,4,5; sum is 12.

Let's try 1,2,3,6. So, the list is [1,2,3,6,9,9]. Sorting it: [1,2,3,6,9,9]. The median is the average of 3rd and 4th terms: (3+6)/2=4.5, which is not an integer. So, invalid.

Another combination: [1,2,4,5]. Sum is 12. So, the list is [1,2,4,5,9,9]. Sorted: [1,2,4,5,9,9]. The median is (4+5)/2=4.5, again not integer.

Hmm, not good. Is there another way to get four distinct positive integers adding up to 12?

Wait, 1,2,3,6 is 12. 1,2,4,5 is 12. 1,3,4,4 is 12, but duplicates aren't allowed because 9 already appears twice, so duplicates would cause another mode. So, invalid.

Alternatively, 2,3,4,3 is invalid due to duplicates. So, seems like with n=6, if 9 appears twice, the median ends up being non-integer.

Wait, what if 9 appears three times? As before, that leaves 3 for the other three numbers, which would have to be 1,1,1, but that creates another mode.

Alternatively, 9 appears three times, and the remaining three numbers are 2,1,0—but wait, positive integers only, so 0 is invalid.

Alternatively, 9 appears three times, and the other three numbers are 1,1,1—but again, duplicate 1s.

So, n=6 doesn't seem feasible.

How about n=8?

Total sum is 30. If 9 is the mode, appearing, say, three times, contributing 27. Remaining sum is 3, spread over five numbers. But those five numbers need to be unique, as 9 appears three times, so no other number can appear three or more times.

But 3 spread over five numbers is difficult because each has to be at least 1, so 1+1+1+1+1=5, which is more than 3. So, impossible.

Alternatively, 9 appears four times, contributing 36, which exceeds 30. So, that's invalid.

Alternatively, 9 appears two times, contributing 18. Remaining sum is 12 over six numbers, each appearing once. So, numbers have to be positive integers, unique, summing to 12.

Possible sets: 1,2,3,4,1,1—but duplicates. So, invalid.

Wait, no, if 9 appears two times, the other six numbers must be unique. So, the numbers have to be distinct. So, the smallest possible sum is 1+2+3+4+5+6=21, which is way higher than 12. So, impossible.

So, n=8 seems invalid.

Wait, perhaps 9 appears three times, contributing 27, and the remaining five numbers sum to 3. But as before, that requires five numbers each at least 1, which sums to at least 5, exceeding 3. Impossible.

So, n=8 is invalid.

How about n=5? Wait, earlier we thought n must be even because if n is odd, the median is the middle term, which is in the list, conflicting with the condition. So, n must be even. Hence, n=5 is invalid.

Wait, but let me confirm. If n is odd, say n=5, then the median is the 3rd term, which is part of the list. But the problem states that the median is not in the list. So, n cannot be odd. So, n must be even. So, n=4,6,8,...

So, moving back to n=4. Earlier, we found a valid list: [5,7,9,9], sum=30, unique mode=9, median=8 not in list. That seems to satisfy all conditions.

But let's see if there are other possibilities with n=4.

Earlier, with [5,7,9,9], median=8. Another possibility: [4,8,9,9], sorted as [4,8,9,9], median=(8+9)/2=8.5, which is not integer. So, invalid.

[6,6,9,9], but that makes mode both 6 and 9, which is not allowed.

[1,11,9,9], sorted as [1,9,9,11], median=(9+9)/2=9, which is in the list—invalid.

[2,10,9,9], sorted as [2,9,9,10], median=9—invalid.

[3,9,9,9], sorted as [3,9,9,9], median=9—in the list—invalid.

[4,8,9,9], as above—invalid.

[5,7,9,9], which is okay.

[6,6,9,9], invalid.

So, only [5,7,9,9] and its permutation works.

But let me check: Are there other numbers besides 5 and 7 that can go with 9s? Let's see.

Suppose 9 appears twice, and the other two numbers are a and b, such that a + b = 12. We saw earlier that the median is the average of the 2nd and 3rd terms, which in the sorted list would be 9 and something else.

Wait, let me think again. If the list is [a,b,9,9], sorted. Then, the median is (b +9)/2.

To have the median not in the list, (b +9)/2 must not be equal to a or b or 9.

Moreover, the median must be an integer, so (b +9) must be even.

Also, since the list is [a,b,9,9], after sorting, if a <= b <=9.

Wait, actually, when sorted, the order depends on a and b.

If a <= b <=9, then the sorted list is [a,b,9,9].

Then, the median is (b +9)/2.

Which must be an integer, not in the list.

So, (b +9)/2 should not be equal to a, b, or 9.

So, (b +9)/2 ≠ a, (b +9)/2 ≠ b, and (b +9)/2 ≠9.

So, let's write equations:

1. (b +9)/2 ≠ a ⇒ b +9 ≠ 2a.

2. (b +9)/2 ≠ b ⇒ b +9 ≠ 2b ⇒ 9 ≠ b.

3. (b +9)/2 ≠9 ⇒ b +9 ≠18 ⇒ b ≠9.

From point 2 and 3, b≠9.

So, b can be from 1 to 8.

Also, from point 1, b +9 ≠2a ⇒ a ≠ (b +9)/2.

Additionally, since a and b are positive integers, and a + b =12.

So, a =12 - b.

So, substituting into equation 1: 12 - b ≠ (b +9)/2.

Multiply both sides by 2:

24 - 2b ≠ b +9

24 -9 ≠3b

15 ≠3b ⇒ b≠5.

So, b≠5.

So, b can be from 1 to 8, excluding 5 and 9.

So, possible values for b:1,2,3,4,6,7,8.

Corresponding a:11,10,9,8,6,5,4.

But a must be less than or equal to b, since in the sorted list, a <= b <=9.

So, let's see:

If b=1, a=11: But a=11 > b=1. So, in sorted list, it becomes [1,11,9,9]. Wait, but earlier when we had [1,11,9,9], the median was 9, which is in the list. So, invalid.

But according to our initial assumption, a<=b, so if b=1, a=11, which contradicts a<=b. So, invalid.

Similarly, for b=2, a=10: Again, a=10 > b=2, which would result in [2,10,9,9]. When sorted, it becomes [2,9,9,10]. The median is (9+9)/2=9, which is in the list—invalid.

For b=3, a=9: But a=9, b=3. Then, sorted list is [3,9,9,9]. The median is (9+9)/2=9, which is in the list—invalid.

For b=4, a=8: So, a=8, b=4. But a=8 > b=4, so sorted list is [4,8,9,9]. Median is (8+9)/2=8.5, which is not integer—invalid.

Wait, but hold on, in this case, b=4, a=8. If we sort them, it becomes [4,8,9,9], so median is (8+9)/2=8.5, not integer—so invalid.

Next, b=6, a=6: So, a=6, b=6. Then, the list is [6,6,9,9]. But that makes the mode 6 and 9, which is bimodal—invalid.

b=7, a=5: So, a=5, b=7. So, the list is [5,7,9,9]. When sorted, it's [5,7,9,9]. The median is (7+9)/2=8, which is not in the list—valid.

Similarly, b=8, a=4: So, a=4, b=8. The list is [4,8,9,9]. When sorted, [4,8,9,9]. The median is (8+9)/2=8.5—not integer—invalid.

So, the only valid case is b=7, a=5. Which gives the list [5,7,9,9], which satisfies all conditions.

Therefore, n=4 is the only possible even length that allows such a list.

Thus, the list is [5,7,9,9]. So, the sum of the squares is 5² +7² +9² +9²=25 +49 +81 +81=25+49=74, 74+81=155, 155+81=236.

Wait, 25 +49 is 74, plus 81 is 155, plus another 81 is 236. So, 236.

But let me verify once more.

List:5,7,9,9.

Sum:5+7+9+9=30—correct.

Mode:9 appears twice, others once—unique mode—correct.

Median: sorted list is [5,7,9,9]. Median is (7+9)/2=8, which is not in the list—correct.

Sum of squares:5²=25,7²=49,9²=81×2=162. Total sum:25+49=74, 74+162=236.

Yes, 236.

Wait, is there another possible list with a different n? Let's see, n=6.

Earlier attempts didn't yield anything, but perhaps I missed something.

Suppose n=6, two 9s, and four other numbers.

Sum contributed by 9s:18, so remaining sum is12 over four numbers, all unique.

So, the four numbers must be distinct positive integers, summing to12.

Possible combinations:1,2,3,6;1,2,4,5.

Let me try 1,2,3,6. So, list is [1,2,3,6,9,9]. Sorted: [1,2,3,6,9,9]. Median is average of 3rd and 4th terms: (3+6)/2=4.5—not integer.

Another combination:1,2,4,5. List: [1,2,4,5,9,9]. Sorted: [1,2,4,5,9,9]. Median is (4+5)/2=4.5—still not integer.

Wait, is there another way to get four distinct positive integers summing to12?

What about 2,3,4,3—no, duplicates. 1,3,4,4—duplicates.

Alternatively, 1,1,5,5—duplicates.

Nope, seems like all possibilities lead to either duplicates or non-integer medians.

Alternatively, maybe three 9s? Then, sum is27, remaining sum is3 over three numbers. So, numbers would be1,1,1—invalid due to duplicate modes.

Or 1,1,1—same problem.

Alternatively, 2,1,0—invalid.

So, n=6 doesn't seem to work.

How about n=8?

Wait, trying n=8: two 9s, sum 18, remaining 12 over six numbers, all unique.

The smallest sum for six unique positive integers is1+2+3+4+5+6=21>12. So, impossible.

Alternatively, three 9s: sum 27, remaining sum 3 over five numbers—again, impossible as 1+1+1+1+1=5>3.

Four 9s: sum 36>30. No.

Hence, n=8 invalid.

So, seems like the only possible list is with n=4: [5,7,9,9], sum of squares 236.

Hence, the answer is 236.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{236}
</think>

Given a list of positive integers with the following properties:
1. The sum of the items in the list is 30.
2. The unique mode of the list is 9.
3. The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself.

We need to find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.

First, we note that the mode being 9 means it must appear more frequently than any other number. The median being a positive integer not in the list implies the list must have an even number of elements. 

After considering various possibilities, we determine that the list must have 4 elements. The only valid configuration that satisfies all conditions is [5, 7, 9, 9]. This list meets the following criteria:
- The sum is 30.
- The mode is 9, appearing twice.
- The median is 8, which is not in the list.

Calculating the sum of the squares of the elements:
\[
5^2 + 7^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 = 25 + 49 + 81 + 81 = 236
\]

Thus, the sum of the squares of all the items in the list is \(\boxed{236}\).
