 The problem: 
Three spheres with radii $11$, $13$, and $19$ are mutually externally tangent. A plane intersects the spheres in three congruent circles centered at $A$, $B$, and $C$, respectively, and the centers of the spheres all lie on the same side of this plane. Suppose that $AB^2 = 560$. Find $AC^2$.


To solve the problem, we need to determine the distances between the centers of the spheres and use the given information about the plane intersecting the spheres.

First, let's denote the centers of the spheres with radii 11, 13, and 19 as \( O_1 \), \( O_2 \), and \( O_3 \) respectively. Since the spheres are mutually externally tangent, the distances between their centers are:
\[
O_1O_2 = 11 + 13 = 24,
\]
\[
O_1O_3 = 11 + 19 = 30,
\]
\[
O_2O_3 = 13 + 19 = 32.
\]

Next, we know that the plane intersects the spheres in three congruent circles centered at points \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) respectively. Let the distances from the centers of the spheres to the plane be \( d_1 \), \( d_2 \), and \( d_3 \) respectively. Since the circles are congruent, the distances from the centers of the spheres to the plane are proportional to the radii of the spheres. Therefore, we have:
\[
d_1 : d_2 : d_3 = 11 : 13 : 19.
\]

Let \( d_1 = 11k \), \( d_2 = 13k \), and \( d_3 = 19k \) for some constant \( k \). The distances between the points \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) on the plane are the same as the distances between the centers of the spheres minus twice the distance from the center of each sphere to the plane. Thus, we have:
\[
AB = O_1O_2 - 2d_1 = 24 - 22k,
\]
\[
BC = O_2O_3 - 2d_2 = 32 - 26k,
\]
\[
CA = O_3O_1 - 2d_3 = 30 - 38k.
\]

We are given that \( AB^2 = 560 \). Substituting the expression for \( AB \), we get:
\[
(24 - 22k)^2 = 560.
\]
Expanding and solving for \( k \), we have:
\[
576 - 1056k + 484k^2 = 560,
\]
\[
484k^2 - 1056k + 16 = 0.
\]
Dividing the entire equation by 4, we get:
\[
121k^2 - 264k + 4 = 0.
\]
Using the quadratic formula \( k = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \) where \( a = 121 \), \( b = -264 \), and \( c = 4 \), we get:
\[
k = \frac{264 \pm \sqrt{264^2 - 4 \cdot 121 \cdot 4}}{2 \cdot 121} = \frac{264 \pm \sqrt{69696 - 1936}}{242} = \frac{264 \pm \sqrt{67760}}{242} = \frac{264 \pm 260}{242}.
\]
This gives us two solutions:
\[
k = \frac{524}{242} = \frac{262}{121} \quad \text{(not possible since it is greater than 1)},
\]
\[
k = \frac{4}{242} = \frac{2}{121}.
\]
Thus, \( k = \frac{2}{121} \).

Now, we need to find \( AC^2 \):
\[
AC = O_3O_1 - 2d_3 = 30 - 38k = 30 - 38 \cdot \frac{2}{121} = 30 - \frac{76}{121} = \frac{3630 - 76}{121} = \frac{3554}{121}.
\]
Therefore,
\[
AC^2 = \left( \frac{3554}{121} \right)^2 = \frac{3554^2}{121^2} = \frac{12630916}{14641} = 869.
\]
The value of \( AC^2 \) is:
\[
\boxed{869}.
\]
