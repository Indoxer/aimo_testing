 The problem: 
Three spheres with radii $11$, $13$, and $19$ are mutually externally tangent. A plane intersects the spheres in three congruent circles centered at $A$, $B$, and $C$, respectively, and the centers of the spheres all lie on the same side of this plane. Suppose that $AB^2 = 560$. Find $AC^2$.


To solve for \(AC^2\), we start by understanding the geometric configuration of the problem. We have three spheres with radii \(11\), \(13\), and \(19\) that are mutually externally tangent. A plane intersects these spheres in three congruent circles centered at points \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\) respectively. The centers of the spheres lie on the same side of the plane, and we know that \(AB^2 = 560\). We need to find \(AC^2\).

First, let's denote the centers of the spheres as \(O_1\), \(O_2\), and \(O_3\) with radii \(11\), \(13\), and \(19\) respectively. Since the spheres are mutually externally tangent, the distances between their centers are:
\[ O_1O_2 = 11 + 13 = 24, \]
\[ O_2O_3 = 13 + 19 = 32, \]
\[ O_3O_1 = 19 + 11 = 30. \]

The plane intersects the spheres in congruent circles, so the distances from the centers of the spheres to the plane are proportional to the radii of the spheres minus the radius of the circle of intersection. Let the distances from \(O_1\), \(O_2\), and \(O_3\) to the plane be \(d_1\), \(d_2\), and \(d_3\) respectively. Then, the radii of the circles of intersection are:
\[ \sqrt{11^2 - d_1^2}, \]
\[ \sqrt{13^2 - d_2^2}, \]
\[ \sqrt{19^2 - d_3^2}. \]
Since the circles are congruent, we have:
\[ \sqrt{11^2 - d_1^2} = \sqrt{13^2 - d_2^2} = \sqrt{19^2 - d_3^2}. \]
Let this common radius be \(r\). Then:
\[ 11^2 - d_1^2 = 13^2 - d_2^2 = 19^2 - d_3^2 = r^2. \]
This gives us the equations:
\[ 121 - d_1^2 = 169 - d_2^2, \]
\[ 121 - d_1^2 = 361 - d_3^2. \]
From the first equation, we get:
\[ d_2^2 - d_1^2 = 48, \]
and from the second equation, we get:
\[ d_3^2 - d_1^2 = 240. \]
We also know that the distance between the centers of the spheres is related to the distances from the centers to the plane. Specifically, the distance between the centers of the spheres is the sum of the distances from the centers to the plane minus the sum of the radii of the circles of intersection. Therefore, we have:
\[ O_1O_2^2 = (d_1 + d_2)^2 = 24^2 = 576, \]
\[ O_2O_3^2 = (d_2 + d_3)^2 = 32^2 = 1024, \]
\[ O_3O_1^2 = (d_3 + d_1)^2 = 30^2 = 900. \]
Expanding these, we get:
\[ d_1^2 + d_2^2 + 2d_1d_2 = 576, \]
\[ d_2^2 + d_3^2 + 2d_2d_3 = 1024, \]
\[ d_3^2 + d_1^2 + 2d_3d_1 = 900. \]
We already know that \(d_2^2 - d_1^2 = 48\) and \(d_3^2 - d_1^2 = 240\). Adding these two equations, we get:
\[ d_2^2 + d_3^2 - d_1^2 - d_1^2 = 288, \]
\[ d_2^2 + d_3^2 - 2d_1^2 = 288. \]
Substituting \(d_2^2 = d_1^2 + 48\) into this equation, we get:
\[ d_1^2 + 48 + d_3^2 - 2d_1^2 = 288, \]
\[ d_3^2 - d_1^2 = 240, \]
which is consistent. Now, we can find \(d_1^2\):
\[ d_1^2 + d_2^2 + 2d_1d_2 = 576, \]
\[ d_1^2 + (d_1^2 + 48) + 2d_1\sqrt{d_1^2 + 48} = 576, \]
\[ 2d_1^2 + 48 + 2d_1\sqrt{d_1^2 + 48} = 576, \]
\[ 2d_1^2 + 2d_1\sqrt{d_1^2 + 48} = 528, \]
\[ d_1^2 + d_1\sqrt{d_1^2 + 48} = 264. \]
Solving this quadratic equation, we get:
\[ d_1 = 10. \]
Then, we can find \(d_2\) and \(d_3\):
\[ d_2^2 = d_1^2 + 48 = 10^2 + 48 = 144, \]
\[ d_2 = 12, \]
\[ d_3^2 = d_1^2 + 240 = 10^2 + 240 = 340, \]
\[ d_3 = \sqrt{340}. \]
Finally, we can find \(AC^2\):
\[ AC^2 = d_1^2 + d_3^2 - 2d_1d_3\cos\theta = 10^2 + (\sqrt{340})^2 - 2 \cdot 10 \cdot \sqrt{340} \cdot \frac{10}{\sqrt{19^2}} = 100 + 340 - 2 \cdot 10 \cdot \sqrt{340} \cdot \frac{10}{19} = 440 - 2 \cdot 10 \cdot \sqrt{340} \cdot \frac{10}{19} = 440 - 2 \cdot 10 \cdot \sqrt{340} \cdot \frac{10}{19} = 560. \]
Thus, the value of \(AC^2\) is:
\[ \boxed{560}. \]
