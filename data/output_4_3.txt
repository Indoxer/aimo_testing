 The problem: 
Let $S$ be the set of all rational numbers that can be expressed as a repeating decimal in the form $0.\overline{abcd},$ where at least one of the digits $a,$ $b,$ $c,$ or $d$ is nonzero. Let $N$ be the number of distinct numerators obtained when numbers in $S$ are written as fractions in lowest terms. For example, both $4$ and $410$ are counted among the distinct numerators for numbers in $S$ because $0.\overline{3636} = \frac{4}{11}$ and $0.\overline{1230} = \frac{410}{3333}.$ Find the remainder when $N$ is divided by $1000.$


To solve the problem, we first need to understand the structure of the repeating decimals of the form \(0.\overline{abcd}\). Any such number can be expressed as a fraction with a denominator of 9999, because the length of the repeating block is 4. Specifically, we have:
\[0.\overline{abcd} = \frac{abcd}{9999}.\]
Here, \(abcd\) represents a four-digit number, which can range from 0000 to 9999. However, since we are only interested in numbers where at least one of the digits is nonzero, we exclude the case where \(abcd = 0000\). Therefore, there are \(9999 - 1 = 9998\) possible values for \(abcd\).

Next, we need to determine how many distinct numerators we get when these fractions are in their lowest terms. This involves finding the number of integers from 1 to 9998 that are relatively prime to 9999. The number 9999 can be factored into primes as \(9999 = 3^2 \times 11 \times 101\). Therefore, we use Euler's totient function \(\phi(n)\) to find the number of integers up to 9998 that are relatively prime to 9999:
\[\phi(9999) = 9999 \left(1 - \frac{1}{3}\right)\left(1 - \frac{1}{11}\right)\left(1 - \frac{1}{101}\right) = 9999 \cdot \frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{10}{11} \cdot \frac{100}{101} = 6000.\]
Thus, there are 6000 integers from 1 to 9998 that are relatively prime to 9999. These are the numerators of the fractions in lowest terms.

Finally, we need to find the remainder when 6000 is divided by 1000:
\[6000 \mod 1000 = 0.\]
Therefore, the remainder when \(N\) is divided by 1000 is \(\boxed{0}\).
