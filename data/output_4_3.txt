 The problem: 
Let $S$ be the set of all rational numbers that can be expressed as a repeating decimal in the form $0.\overline{abcd},$ where at least one of the digits $a,$ $b,$ $c,$ or $d$ is nonzero. Let $N$ be the number of distinct numerators obtained when numbers in $S$ are written as fractions in lowest terms. For example, both $4$ and $410$ are counted among the distinct numerators for numbers in $S$ because $0.\overline{3636} = \frac{4}{11}$ and $0.\overline{1230} = \frac{410}{3333}.$ Find the remainder when $N$ is divided by $1000.$


To solve this problem, we first need to understand the form of the repeating decimals in the set \( S \). A number in the form \( 0.\overline{abcd} \) can be expressed as a fraction. Specifically, if we let \( x = 0.\overline{abcd} \), then

\[
x = \frac{abcd}{9999},
\]

where \( abcd \) represents the four-digit number formed by the digits \( a, b, c, \) and \( d \). This fraction can be simplified to its lowest terms by dividing the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor (gcd).

The number \( 9999 \) can be factored into prime factors as follows:

\[
9999 = 3^2 \times 11 \times 101.
\]

Thus, the fraction \( \frac{abcd}{9999} \) will be in its lowest terms if and only if the numerator \( abcd \) is not divisible by 3, 11, or 101. We need to count the number of distinct numerators that can be obtained after simplifying these fractions.

First, we count the total number of four-digit numbers, which is \( 9999 \) (from 1000 to 9999). We need to exclude the numbers that are divisible by 3, 11, or 101.

Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, we calculate the number of four-digit numbers that are divisible by 3, 11, or 101. Let \( A \) be the set of numbers divisible by 3, \( B \) be the set of numbers divisible by 11, and \( C \) be the set of numbers divisible by 101. Then,

\[
|A| = \left\lfloor \frac{9999}{3} \right\rfloor = 3333,
\]
\[
|B| = \left\lfloor \frac{9999}{11} \right\rfloor = 909,
\]
\[
|C| = \left\lfloor \frac{9999}{101} \right\rfloor = 99,
\]
\[
|A \cap B| = \left\lfloor \frac{9999}{33} \right\rfloor = 303,
\]
\[
|A \cap C| = \left\lfloor \frac{9999}{303} \right\rfloor = 33,
\]
\[
|B \cap C| = \left\lfloor \frac{9999}{1111} \right\rfloor = 9,
\]
\[
|A \cap B \cap C| = \left\lfloor \frac{9999}{3333} \right\rfloor = 3.
\]

By the principle of inclusion-exclusion, the number of four-digit numbers that are divisible by 3, 11, or 101 is

\[
|A \cup B \cup C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A \cap B| - |A \cap C| - |B \cap C| + |A \cap B \cap C| = 3333 + 909 + 99 - 303 - 33 - 9 + 3 = 3998.
\]

Therefore, the number of four-digit numbers that are not divisible by 3, 11, or 101 is

\[
9999 - 3998 = 6001.
\]

Since each of these numerators can be reduced to a unique fraction in its lowest terms, the number of distinct numerators is 6001. The remainder when 6001 is divided by 1000 is

\[
\boxed{001}.
\]
