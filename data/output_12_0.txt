 The problem: 
Let $a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i$ be distinct integers from $1$ to $9.$ The minimum possible positive value of \[\dfrac{a \cdot b \cdot c - d \cdot e \cdot f}{g \cdot h \cdot i}\] can be written as $\frac{m}{n},$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n.$


Okay, so I have this math problem here, and it seems a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down step by step. The problem is about finding the minimum possible positive value of the expression:

\[
\dfrac{a \cdot b \cdot c - d \cdot e \cdot f}{g \cdot h \cdot i}
\]

where \(a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i\) are distinct integers from 1 to 9. Then, we need to express this minimal value as a fraction \(\frac{m}{n}\) with \(m\) and \(n\) coprime, and find \(m + n\).

Alright, first thoughts. Since all variables are distinct digits from 1 to 9, we're dealing with permutations of these numbers. The goal is to minimize the positive value of that fraction. So, essentially, we want the numerator \(a \cdot b \cdot c - d \cdot e \cdot f\) to be as small as possible while keeping it positive, and the denominator \(g \cdot h \cdot i\) to be as large as possible.

That makes sense because a smaller numerator (but still positive) divided by a larger denominator will give a smaller overall fraction. So, our strategy should be twofold:

1. Make \(a \cdot b \cdot c\) just slightly larger than \(d \cdot e \cdot f\) to keep their difference small.
2. Maximize \(g \cdot h \cdot i\) by using the largest available digits for \(g, h, i\).

So, let's tackle these two parts separately.

**First Part: Minimizing the Numerator**

We need \(a \cdot b \cdot c\) and \(d \cdot e \cdot f\) to be as close as possible without being equal since all numbers are distinct. So, we want two products of three distinct digits each to be consecutive numbers or at least differing by 1 if possible.

But wait, given the constraints of digits 1 through 9, getting two products that are exactly 1 apart might not be feasible because the smallest product is 1×2×3=6, and the next would be 1×2×4=8, which is a difference of 2. Hmm, maybe 1×2×5=10 and 1×3×4=12—that’s a difference of 2 again. Maybe higher numbers?

Wait, actually, let's think differently. Instead of focusing on exact differences, perhaps looking for products that are as close as possible. Let me list some possible triplets and their products.

For example:

- 1×2×3 = 6
- 1×2×4 = 8
- 1×2×5 = 10
- 1×2×6 = 12
- 1×2×7 = 14
- 1×2×8 = 16
- 1×2×9 = 18

Alternatively,

- 1×3×4 = 12
- 1×3×5 = 15
- 1×3×6 = 18
- 1×4×5 = 20
- 1×4×6 = 24
- 1×5×6 = 30

And higher combinations:

- 2×3×4 = 24
- 2×3×5 = 30
- 2×4×5 = 40
- etc.

Looking at these, the closest products seem to be around 12 and 14 or 15, but let's see:

Wait, 6 and 8 differ by 2, but 8 and 10 also differ by 2. However, when considering triplets, it's important that all digits are unique across all variables.

Wait, another approach: What is the smallest possible difference between two products of three distinct digits from 1 to 9? That could help.

I remember reading somewhere that the minimal positive difference between two such products is 1, but I'm not sure. Let me check.

Suppose we have two triplets whose products differ by 1. For example, is there a case where \(a \cdot b \cdot c = k\) and \(d \cdot e \cdot f = k + 1\), with all digits distinct?

If such a pair exists, then that would give us the minimal numerator of 1, leading to the minimal fraction if the denominator is maximized. But I'm not sure if such a pair exists.

Let me try to find such pairs.

Looking at the products:

- 1×2×3 = 6
- 1×2×4 = 8 (differs by 2)
- 1×2×5 = 10 (differs by 4 from 6)
- 1×3×4 = 12 (differs by 6 from 6)

Wait, perhaps higher products:

What about 1×8×9 = 72

And 2×3×4 = 24

Nope, that's a big difference.

Wait, maybe 3×4×5 = 60 and 3×5×6 = 90? Still too far.

Wait, perhaps something like 2×3×5=30 and 2×5×7=70—no, that's not helpful.

Hmm, maybe I should look for products that are closer together.

Wait, let's consider 2×2×2=8, but no, duplicates aren't allowed.

Wait, what about 1×5×6=30 and 2×3×5=30? No, same product.

Wait, 1×5×7=35 and 2×5×7=70—again, too much.

Wait, how about 1×7×8=56 and 2×4×7=56? Again, same product.

Hmm, maybe trying smaller numbers.

Wait, 2×3×4=24 and 1×4×6=24. Also same.

Wait, maybe 1×6×7=42 and 2×3×7=42. Same.

This seems not working. Perhaps it's impossible to get a difference of 1.

Therefore, maybe the minimal positive difference is 2?

Looking back, 1×2×3=6 and 1×2×4=8 differ by 2.

Is there any other pair with a difference of 2?

How about 1×3×4=12 and 1×2×5=10—difference is 2.

Similarly, 1×2×6=12 and 1×3×4=12—same product.

Wait, 2×3×4=24 and 1×4×6=24—same.

Wait, 2×3×5=30 and 2×3×6=36—difference is 6.

Hmm, maybe 1×8×9=72 and 2×7×5=70—difference of 2.

Ah! Here we go. 72 and 70 differ by 2. So, is that correct?

Let me verify:

1×8×9=72

2×5×7=70

Yes, indeed, both products are 70 and 72, so their difference is 2.

Great, so we can have a difference of 2. Are there any smaller differences?

Earlier, I thought maybe 1, but perhaps 2 is the minimal possible.

So, if we can achieve a difference of 2, that's pretty good. But let's see if we can get lower.

Wait, another pair: 1×9×8=72 and 3×4×6=72—same product. So, no difference.

How about 3×5×6=90 and 2×5×9=90—same.

Wait, maybe 1×5×9=45 and 3×3×5=45—but duplicates again.

Wait, perhaps 1×7×8=56 and 2×4×7=56—same.

Not helpful.

Wait, 1×5×7=35 and 2×5×7=70—difference of 35, which is way too big.

Hmm.

Wait, 2×4×9=72 and 3×3×8=72—again, duplicates.

So, perhaps the minimal difference is indeed 2. Therefore, the minimal numerator is 2, and then we need to maximize the denominator.

So, moving on.

**Second Part: Maximizing the Denominator**

The denominator is \(g \cdot h \cdot i\). To maximize this, we should use the three largest digits available, which are 7, 8, and 9.

Thus, \(g=7\), \(h=8\), \(i=9\), making the denominator \(7 \times 8 \times 9 = 504\).

But hold on, we have to ensure that none of these digits are used in the numerator triplet. Because all digits must be distinct.

In the earlier example where the numerator was 72 - 70 = 2, we had:

- Numerator: 72 is from 1×8×9, and 70 is from 2×5×7.

Thus, the digits used are 1, 8, 9, 2, 5, 7.

Then, the remaining digits are 3, 4, 6.

So, the denominator would be 3×4×6=72.

But wait, is that the maximum?

Because if we choose the three largest digits not used in the numerator, which are 3,4,6, giving 72. But if we can arrange the numerator to use different digits, leaving 7,8,9 free, that would give a much larger denominator.

But in my previous thought, the numerator used 1,8,9 and 2,5,7, leaving 3,4,6 for the denominator. That gives a denominator of 72.

But if instead, we manage the numerator such that the digits used don't include 7,8,9, then the denominator can be 7×8×9=504.

So, is that possible?

Let me check.

We have the numerator as either 72 - 70 = 2 or similar, but in that case, we used 7, which is part of the denominator. So, that won't work.

Therefore, to have the denominator as 504, we need the numerator triplet not to include 7,8,9.

Thus, the numerator triplet must be made up of the remaining digits: 1,2,3,4,5,6.

So, now, we need to split these six digits into two triplets, each multiplying to give products as close as possible.

Our aim is to have \(a \cdot b \cdot c\) and \(d \cdot e \cdot f\) as close as possible, with both products using only digits 1-6, and all distinct.

So, let's focus on the digits 1,2,3,4,5,6.

We need to partition them into two groups of three, compute the products, and find the pair with the smallest difference.

To do this, let me list all possible triplets and their products:

Triplet 1:
- 1,2,3: 6
- 1,2,4: 8
- 1,2,5: 10
- 1,2,6: 12
- 1,3,4: 12
- 1,3,5: 15
- 1,3,6: 18
- 1,4,5: 20
- 1,4,6: 24
- 1,5,6: 30
- 2,3,4: 24
- 2,3,5: 30
- 2,3,6: 36
- 2,4,5: 40
- 2,4,6: 48
- 2,5,6: 60
- 3,4,5: 60
- 3,4,6: 72
- 3,5,6: 90
- 4,5,6: 120

Now, we need two triplets from this list whose products are as close as possible.

Looking through the list, let's find pairs:

Looking for the closest pairs:

- 12 and 12 (but same triplet)
- 12 and 15 (difference 3)
- 12 and 18 (difference 6)
- 12 and 20 (difference 8)
- 12 and 24 (difference 12)
- 15 and 18 (difference 3)
- 15 and 20 (difference 5)
- 18 and 20 (difference 2)
- 18 and 24 (difference 6)
- 20 and 24 (difference 4)
- 24 and 30 (difference 6)
- 24 and 30 (difference 6)
- 30 and 30 (same triplet)
- 30 and 40 (difference 10)
- 30 and 48 (difference 18)
- 40 and 48 (difference 8)
- 40 and 60 (difference 20)
- 48 and 60 (difference 12)
- 60 and 60 (same triplet)
- 60 and 72 (difference 12)
- 60 and 90 (difference 30)
- 72 and 90 (difference 18)
- 90 and 120 (difference 30)

Wait, interesting. So, looking at these differences, the smallest difference is 2, between 18 and 20.

So, triplet 1×3×6=18 and triplet 1×4×5=20. Their difference is 2.

Alternatively, triplet 1×3×6=18 and 1×4×5=20. Difference is 2.

Another pair is triplet 1×2×5=10 and 1×3×4=12, difference 2.

Also, triplet 1×2×6=12 and 1×3×4=12, same triplet.

Wait, let's note down all pairs with a difference of 2:

1. 18 (1×3×6) and 20 (1×4×5): difference 2.
2. 10 (1×2×5) and 12 (1×3×4): difference 2.

Are there others? Let me check.

Looking at the list:

- 24 and 24: same triplet, no difference.
- 30 and 30: same triplet.
- 48 and 48: same triplet.
- 60 and 60: same triplet.

No, those are same triplets.

So, the closest products are 10 & 12, 18 & 20, both differing by 2.

Thus, in both cases, the minimal difference is 2.

So, now, with that in mind, let's proceed.

So, to get a numerator of 2, we can have:

Either:

1×3×6=18 and 1×4×5=20, so 20 - 18 = 2.

Or:

1×2×5=10 and 1×3×4=12, so 12 - 10 = 2.

However, in both cases, the digit '1' is used in both triplets, meaning that digit 1 is used twice, which isn't allowed because all digits must be distinct.

Oh, right! That's a problem.

So, even though the products are 18 and 20 or 10 and 12, they both share the digit '1', making it impossible to assign uniquely.

So, that's an issue. Therefore, those pairs cannot be used because they share a common digit.

Hence, we need to look for pairs of triplets that have a product difference of 2 but do not share any digits.

Is that possible?

Looking back at the triplet products:

Looking for two triplets with a difference of 2, and no overlapping digits.

From the list above:

- 1×3×6=18 and 1×4×5=20: overlap on 1.
- 1×2×5=10 and 1×3×4=12: overlap on 1.

Any others?

Wait, let's see:

Looking for triplet A and triplet B where |product(A) - product(B)| = 2 and no shared digits.

Looking through the list:

- 12 (1×2×6) and 14? Wait, 14 isn't a product here.

Wait, 12 and 14: 14 isn't a product.

Wait, 12 and 15: difference 3.

Wait, 12 and 18: difference 6.

Wait, 15 and 18: difference 3.

15 and 20: difference 5.

18 and 20: difference 2, but overlapping digit '1'.

Wait, 20 (1×4×5) and 22? 22 isn't a product.

Wait, 24 and 26: Not present.

Wait, 24 and 22: Not present.

Wait, 24 and 30: difference 6.

Wait, 30 and 32: Not present.

Wait, 30 and 35: Not present.

Wait, 35 and 37: Not present.

Wait, 40 and 42: Not present.

Wait, 42 isn't a product here.

Wait, 48 and 50: Not present.

Wait, 50 isn't a product.

Wait, 60 and 62: Not present.

Wait, 62 isn't a product.

Hmm, seems like after checking all possibilities, the only pairs with a difference of 2 are those overlapping on digit '1'. Hence, there's no pair of triplets with a difference of 2 that doesn't share a digit.

Therefore, perhaps the next best thing is a difference of 3.

Looking back, the next smallest difference is 3.

Looking through the list:

- 12 (1×2×6) and 15 (1×3×5): difference 3, but overlapping on '1'.
- 15 (1×3×5) and 18 (1×3×6): difference 3, overlapping on '1'.
- 18 (1×3×6) and 21: Not present.
- 12 (1×2×6) and 15: already considered.

Wait, 20 (1×4×5) and 23: Not present.

Wait, 24 (2×3×4) and 27: Not present.

Wait, 24 and 27: 24 is present, 27 isn't.

Wait, 30 and 33: Not present.

Wait, 30 and 35: Not present.

Hmm, seems like other differences of 3 are also overlapping on digits.

Wait, 6 and 9: Not a product.

Wait, 8 (1×2×4) and 11: Not present.

Wait, 10 (1×2×5) and 13: Not present.

24 and 27: Not present.

30 and 33: Not present.

30 and 35: Not present.

40 and 43: Not present.

Hmm, so perhaps the next possible minimal difference is 4.

Looking for a difference of 4.

Looking through the list:

- 6 (1×2×3) and 10 (1×2×5): difference 4, overlapping on '1'.
- 6 and 10: Overlapping.
- 8 (1×2×4) and 12 (1×2×6): difference 4, overlapping on '1'.
- 8 and 12: Overlapping.
- 10 (1×2×5) and 14: Not present.
- 12 (1×2×6) and 16: Not present.
- 12 and 16: Not present.
- 15 (1×3×5) and 19: Not present.
- 18 (1×3×6) and 22: Not present.
- 20 (1×4×5) and 24 (2×3×4): difference 4, non-overlapping!

Wait, 20 and 24: 20 is 1×4×5, 24 is 2×3×4.

Wait, do they share any digits? 20 uses 1,4,5; 24 uses 2,3,4. So, they share the digit '4'. Oops, so overlapping on '4'.

So, not acceptable.

Next, 24 (2×3×4) and 28: Not present.

24 and 28: Not present.

24 and 25: Not present.

24 and 26: Not present.

Wait, 24 and 30: 30 is 1×5×6, which overlaps with 24 on nothing. Wait, 24 is 2×3×4, and 30 is 1×5×6. They don't share any digits. So, 24 and 30: difference of 6. Not helpful.

Wait, 18 (1×3×6) and 24 (2×3×4): overlapping on '3'.

So, that's no good.

Wait, 12 (1×2×6) and 15 (1×3×5): overlapping on '1'.

Hmm, this is getting frustrating. It seems like every time I find a pair with a small difference, they share a common digit. Is there really no pair of triplets with a difference of 2 or 3 that don't share digits? Or am I missing something?

Wait, let me double-check the triplet products.

Looking back:

Triplet products for digits 1-6:

6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 18, 20, 24, 30.

So, looking for pairs with difference 2 or 3.

Difference 2:

12 and 14: 14 not present.

12 and 15: difference 3.

18 and 21: Not present.

20 and 23: Not present.

24 and 27: Not present.

30 and 33: Not present.

So, yeah, all the pairs with differences 2 or 3 either don't exist or share a digit.

So, perhaps the minimal difference without overlapping digits is 4.

So, compiling all triplet products:

6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 18, 20, 24, 30.

So, as before.

So, in this case, the only pairs with difference less than 6 are those with difference 2 or 3, but all those require overlapping digits.

So, perhaps the minimal difference without overlapping digits is 6.

Wait, 24 and 30: difference 6, non-overlapping digits.

So, triplet A: 2×3×4=24.

Triplet B: 1×5×6=30.

Digits used: 2,3,4,1,5,6. So, digits 7,8,9 are left.

Thus, denominator is 7×8×9=504.

Numerator is 24 - 30 = -6. The absolute value is 6/504=1/84.

Wait, that's a possibility.

Alternatively, if we flip the numerator: 30 - 24=6, so 6/504=1/84.

So, that's one candidate.

But wait, is there a pair with a smaller difference?

Wait, 24 and 30: difference 6.

But perhaps another pair with difference 6 but non-overlapping digits.

Looking through the list:

- 6 and 12: difference 6, but overlapping on '1' and '2'.

Wait, 6 (1×2×3) and 12 (1×2×6): overlapping on '1' and '2'.

- 8 and 14: Not present.

- 10 and 16: Not present.

- 12 and 18: difference 6, but overlapping on '1' and '2' and '3'.

12 (1×2×6) and 18 (1×3×6): overlapping on '1' and '6'.

- 15 and 21: Not present.

- 18 and 24: overlapping on '4'.

- 20 and 26: Not present.

- 24 and 30: difference 6, non-overlapping.

So, 24 and 30 is unique in that aspect.

So, 24 and 30: difference 6, non-overlapping digits.

Thus, numerator is 6, denominator is 504.

Thus, the fraction is 6/504.

Simplify it:

Divide numerator and denominator by 6: 1/84.

So, 1/84 is the fraction.

Wait, is that the minimal?

Wait, is there another pair with difference 6, non-overlapping digits?

Looking through the triplet products:

- 6 and 12: overlapping.

- 6 and 18: overlapping.

- 6 and 24: overlapping.

- 6 and 30: overlapping.

- 8 and 14: Not present.

- 8 and 20: difference 12.

- 10 and 16: Not present.

- 10 and 24: difference 14.

- 12 and 18: overlapping.

- 12 and 24: overlapping.

- 12 and 30: difference 18.

- 15 and 21: Not present.

- 15 and 27: Not present.

- 18 and 24: overlapping.

- 18 and 30: difference 12.

- 20 and 26: Not present.

- 20 and 30: overlapping.

- 24 and 30: difference 6.

So, the only pair with difference 6 is 24 and 30, which don't share any digits.

So, that's our best shot.

Thus, numerator is 6, denominator is 504.

So, the fraction is 6/504=1/84.

So, m=1, n=84.

Check if they are coprime: gcd(1,84)=1, yes.

Thus, m + n=1 + 84=85.

But, wait, is that the minimal possible?

Wait, is there another way to arrange the numerator and denominator to get a smaller fraction?

Wait, perhaps arranging the numerator as 30 - 24=6, same as before.

Alternatively, is there a way to get a negative numerator with a larger denominator magnitude, resulting in a smaller fraction?

Wait, no, because the numerator is subtracted, but we take the absolute value.

Wait, so regardless of which is larger, we take the absolute difference, so it's symmetric.

Wait, unless we can make the numerator smaller.

Wait, 6 is the smallest difference we can get without overlapping digits.

So, 6 is the minimal numerator, and 504 is the maximal denominator.

Thus, 6/504 is the minimal positive value.

Wait, but let me check—if we use different triplet groupings, maybe we can get a larger denominator but same numerator.

Wait, but the denominator is fixed as 7×8×9=504.

Unless we can rearrange the digits so that the denominator uses larger digits, but we already tried that.

Wait, no, because we have to use the largest digits for the denominator.

Therefore, 504 is the maximum denominator, and 6 is the minimal numerator difference.

So, 6/504=1/84 is the minimal positive value.

Wait, but let me confirm—is there another combination where the numerator is smaller?

Wait, no. Because 6 is the minimal difference with non-overlapping triplets.

Wait, so I think 1/84 is the answer, so m + n=85.

But wait, hold on, let me think again.

Wait, suppose instead of using digits 1,2,3,4,5,6 for the numerator, I use a different set of digits for the numerator and denominator.

Wait, for instance, suppose I use the digits 1,2,3,4,5,7 for the numerator.

Wait, then the denominator would be 6×8×9=432.

But then, can I arrange the numerator triplets such that their difference is smaller?

Wait, for instance, if the numerator is 1×5×7=35 and 2×3×4=24.

Difference is 11.

Which is worse than 6.

Alternatively, 1×6×7=42 and 2×3×5=30: difference 12.

Still worse.

Wait, alternatively, 1×2×7=14 and 3×4×5=60: difference 46.

No, that's worse.

Wait, 1×3×7=21 and 2×4×5=40: difference 19.

Worse.

Wait, 1×4×7=28 and 2×3×5=30: difference 2.

Wait, 28 and 30: difference 2.

But, wait, 28 is 1×4×7, and 30 is 2×3×5.

So, digits used are 1,4,7 and 2,3,5.

Thus, all digits 1,2,3,4,5,7 are used in the numerator.

Leaving digits 6,8,9 for the denominator.

Thus, denominator is 6×8×9=432.

Numerator is 30 - 28=2.

Thus, the fraction is 2/432=1/216≈0.00463.

Compare that to our previous 1/84≈0.0119.

Wait, 1/216 is smaller.

So, that's better.

Wait, so perhaps this is a better arrangement.

Wait, so numerator is 2, denominator is 432.

Simplifies to 1/216.

So, m + n=1 + 216=217.

But, wait, is that acceptable?

Wait, let me check the digits:

Numerator: 1×4×7=28 and 2×3×5=30.

Digits used: 1,4,7,2,3,5.

Denominator: 6×8×9=432.

Digits used: 6,8,9.

All digits 1-9 used once. Perfect.

So, the fraction is |28 - 30| / (6×8×9)=2 / 432=1/216.

So, that's smaller than 1/84.

Wow, that's better.

So, why didn't I think of that earlier.

Wait, so that suggests that perhaps the minimal positive value is 1/216, giving m + n=217.

But, wait, can we go even lower?

Wait, let's explore further.

Is there a way to get numerator difference of 1?

Wait, if numerator difference is 1, denominator as 504, so 1/504.

But, is that possible?

Meaning, can we find two triplets with products differing by 1, non-overlapping digits.

Wait, that would be fantastic, but unlikely.

Wait, let's see.

Looking at the triplet products:

6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 18, 20, 24, 30.

Looking for two products differing by 1.

Looking through, 6 and 7: Not present.

8 and 9: Not present.

10 and 11: Not present.

12 and 13: Not present.

15 and 14: Not present.

18 and 17: Not present.

20 and 19: Not present.

24 and 23: Not present.

30 and 29: Not present.

So, no, there are no two triplet products differing by 1.

Therefore, numerator difference can't be 1.

Thus, next possible is 2, which we achieved.

So, 2 is the minimal numerator difference possible without overlapping digits.

Wait, but in the previous case, we had numerator difference 2 with denominator 432, giving 1/216.

But wait, wait, 2 is a smaller numerator difference than 6, but 432 is a larger denominator.

So, 2/432=1/216 is smaller than 6/504=1/84.

Therefore, 1/216 is better.

So, that's the minimal positive value.

But, hold on, let me see if I can get a numerator difference of 2 with a larger denominator.

Wait, if I can get the denominator as 7×8×9=504, but numerator difference of 2, then 2/504=1/252≈0.00396.

Which is smaller than 1/216≈0.00463.

Wait, so 1/252 is smaller.

Wait, but is that possible?

Wait, to get numerator difference of 2 with denominator 504.

So, is there a way to have numerator as 28 and 30, which gives difference 2, but denominator as 504.

But wait, in that case, the digits used in numerator would be 1,4,7 and 2,3,5, as before.

Leaving digits 6,8,9 for denominator.

But 6×8×9=432, not 504.

Wait, unless we rearrange the digits.

Wait, perhaps using different digits in numerator.

Wait, let me think.

Suppose numerator is 2×3×something and 1×4×something else.

Wait, wait, perhaps if we use a different set of digits for the numerator and denominator.

Wait, let me try.

Suppose I use digits 1,5,6 for the denominator: 1×5×6=30.

But then, the remaining digits are 2,3,4,7,8,9.

We need to split them into two triplets.

Wait, perhaps triplet A: 2×3×4=24.

Triplet B: 7×8×9=504.

Wait, but 504 - 24=480, which is a big number.

Alternatively, Triplet A: 2×3×7=42.

Triplet B: 4×8×9=288.

Difference: 288 - 42=246.

Not helpful.

Wait, Triplet A: 2×3×8=48.

Triplet B: 4×7×9=252.

Difference: 252 - 48=204.

Still too big.

Wait, Triplet A: 2×3×9=54.

Triplet B:4×7×8=224.

Difference:224 -54=170.

Still big.

Wait, Triplet A: 2×4×7=56.

Triplet B:3×8×9=216.

Difference:216 -56=160.

Still big.

Wait, Triplet A: 2×4×8=64.

Triplet B:3×7×9=189.

Difference:189 -64=125.

Still big.

Wait, Triplet A: 2×4×9=72.

Triplet B:3×7×8=168.

Difference:168 -72=96.

Still big.

Wait, Triplet A: 2×5×... Wait, no, 5 is already used in denominator.

Wait, denominator is 1×5×6=30.

So, digits 2,3,4,7,8,9 remain.

Wait, Triplet A: 2×3×something and Triplet B:4×something×something.

Wait, trying Triplet A:2×3×7=42.

Triplet B:4×8×9=288.

Difference:288 -42=246.

No good.

Wait, Triplet A:2×3×8=48.

Triplet B:4×7×9=252.

Difference:252 -48=204.

Still too big.

Wait, Triplet A:2×3×9=54.

Triplet B:4×7×8=224.

Difference:224 -54=170.

Wait, Triplet A:2×4×7=56.

Triplet B:3×8×9=216.

Difference:216 -56=160.

Wait, Triplet A:2×4×8=64.

Triplet B:3×7×9=189.

Difference:189 -64=125.

Wait, Triplet A:2×4×9=72.

Triplet B:3×7×8=168.

Difference:168 -72=96.

Wait, Triplet A:3×4×7=84.

Triplet B:2×8×9=144.

Difference:144 -84=60.

Hmm, okay, that's better.

So, numerator is 84 - 144= -60, absolute value 60.

Denominator is 1×5×6=30.

So, 60 / 30=2.

Wait, that's a whole number, so not useful.

Wait, that's worse.

Wait, so, perhaps denominator has to be 504.

Wait, so 1×2×3=6, 4×5×6=120.

Wait, difference 114, which is bigger.

Wait, hmm.

Wait, perhaps another approach.

Wait, if I use the digits 1,2,3,4,5,6 in the numerator, arranged as two triplets.

Wait, as we saw earlier, the minimal difference was 6, giving 6/504=1/84.

But, when I used triplets 1×4×7=28 and 2×3×5=30, the difference is 2, but leaves out digit 6,8,9 in the denominator, which is 6×8×9=432.

So, 2/432=1/216≈0.00463.

Whereas, 6/504=1/84≈0.0119.

So, 1/216 is smaller.

Wait, so is 1/216 the minimal?

Wait, can we get a numerator difference of 2 with a larger denominator?

Wait, to get a larger denominator, we need to leave more high digits for the denominator.

But, in order to do that, we have to use lower digits in the numerator.

Wait, but the minimal difference for numerator is 2, regardless of the denominator.

Wait, so is there a way to have a numerator difference of 2 with a denominator that's as large as possible, say 504?

Wait, but for that, we need to use the digits 1,2,3,4,5,6 in the numerator.

But in that case, the denominator would be 7×8×9=504.

But, as we saw earlier, the minimal difference with those digits is 6, giving 6/504=1/84.

Alternatively, if we swap some digits between numerator and denominator to get a larger denominator and a smaller numerator.

Wait, but if we move a higher digit into the numerator, we might increase the denominator's digits.

Wait, let me try.

Suppose, instead of using 1,2,3,4,5,6 in the numerator, we use 1,2,4,5,6,7.

Then, the denominator would be 3×8×9=216.

Wait, but then the numerator needs to be split into two triplets.

Wait, 1,2,4,5,6,7.

Possible triplet splits:

Triplet A:1×2×4=8, Triplet B:5×6×7=210.

Difference:210 -8=202.

Not helpful.

Alternatively, Triplet A:1×5×6=30, Triplet B:2×4×7=56.

Difference:56 -30=26.

Still, the fraction would be 26 / 216≈0.12.

Which is worse than 1/216.

Wait, maybe Triplet A:1×2×7=14, Triplet B:4×5×6=120.

Difference:120 -14=106.

Fraction:106 /216≈0.49.

Not good.

Wait, Triplet A:1×4×5=20, Triplet B:2×6×7=84.

Difference:84 -20=64.

Fraction:64 /216≈0.296.

Still worse.

Hmm, seems like moving higher digits into the numerator reduces the denominator's potential, thus increasing the fraction.

Alternatively, moving lower digits into the denominator.

Wait, let me think.

If I use digits 7,8,9 in the denominator, as before, but maybe use some higher digits in the numerator.

Wait, but then denominator's product becomes 7×8×9=504, which is the maximum.

But as seen earlier, the numerator difference is 6, giving 1/84.

Alternatively, using lower digits in the numerator allows a larger denominator.

Wait, but we've tried that.

Wait, so 1/216 vs 1/84.

1/216 is smaller.

Wait, so 1/216 is the minimal.

Wait, but is that achievable?

Wait, as above, the numerator difference is 2, denominator is 432.

But wait, 2/432 simplifies to 1/216.

Yes, correct.

So, that works.

Wait, but is there a way to get a numerator difference of 1?

Wait, as we saw before, it's impossible because the closest triplet products are 6 and 8 (difference 2), 8 and 10 (difference 2), etc.

Wait, so 2 is the minimal.

So, 2/432=1/216.

Thus, m=1, n=216.

GCD(1,216)=1, so yes, reduced.

Therefore, m + n=1 + 216=217.

But, wait, hold on.

Wait, can we get a numerator difference of 2 with a larger denominator?

Like, using 7,8,9 in the denominator.

Wait, denominator is 7×8×9=504.

But, to get a numerator difference of 2 with denominator 504, we need to have numerator triplets with a difference of 2.

But, as we saw, the triplet products are 6,8,10,12,15,18,20,24,30.

No two triplets with a difference of 2 except 28 and 30, which uses digits 1,4,7 and 2,3,5.

Thus, to get numerator difference 2 with denominator 504, we need to use the digits 1,2,3,4,5,7 in the numerator, leaving 6,8,9 for denominator.

But in that case, the denominator is 6×8×9=432, not 504.

Wait, unless we can arrange the digits differently.

Wait, to have denominator as 504, we need to use 6,7,8,9, but 6 is in the numerator.

Wait, no, because 6 is in the numerator.

Wait, so if we have denominator as 7×8×9=504, numerator is 1,2,3,4,5,6.

But as we saw earlier, the minimal difference in numerator is 6, giving 6/504=1/84.

Thus, you can't get a difference of 2 with denominator 504 because the required triplet products (28 and 30) would require digits 1,4,7 and 2,3,5, which excludes 6, hence denominator can't be 504.

Therefore, the maximum denominator we can have with a numerator difference of 2 is 432, giving 1/216.

Thus, 1/216 is the minimal positive value.

Therefore, m=1, n=216, so m + n=217.

Wait, but wait, let me make sure there isn't a smarter way.

Wait, suppose I use digits 1,2,3,4,5,7 in the numerator, with triplet products 28 and 30, giving difference 2.

Denominator is 6×8×9=432.

Thus, fraction is 2/432=1/216.

Yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, is there a way to use a different set of digits for the numerator and denominator to get a smaller fraction?

Wait, for example, using 1,2,4,5,7,8 in the numerator.

Wait, triplet A:1×2×8=16, triplet B:4×5×7=140.

Difference:140 -16=124.

Fraction:124/(3×6×9)=124/162≈0.765.

Not helpful.

Wait, Triplet A:1×4×8=32, Triplet B:2×5×7=70.

Difference:70 -32=38.

Fraction:38/(3×6×9)=38/162≈0.234.

Still, worse than 1/216.

Wait, Triplet A:2×4×5=40, Triplet B:1×7×8=56.

Difference:56 -40=16.

Fraction:16/(3×6×9)=16/162≈0.0987.

Hmm, 0.0987 is less than 1/84≈0.0119?

Wait, no, 0.0987 is greater than 0.0119.

Wait, 1/84≈0.0119, which is smaller.

So, 0.0987 is bigger.

Wait, so 1/84 is still smaller.

Wait, so 1/216≈0.00463 is smaller.

Therefore, 1/216 is the minimal.

Alternatively, is there a way to get a numerator difference of 2 with a larger denominator?

Wait, if we leave more high digits in the denominator.

Wait, for example, using 7,8,9 in the denominator, but that requires numerator to use 1,2,3,4,5,6.

As before, minimal numerator difference is 6, giving 6/504=1/84.

But, if we can leave out 6,8,9, but that complicates.

Wait, no, because 6 is needed in the numerator.

Wait, if I use 6 in the numerator, the denominator can't have 6.

Thus, to maximize denominator, we have to use 7,8,9, but that leaves 6 in the numerator.

So, numerator includes 6, limiting the minimal difference.

Alternatively, if we leave out 6,8,9 from the numerator, but that would mean putting them in the denominator, but then the denominator would be 6×8×9=432, as above.

Wait, but in that case, numerator is 1,2,3,4,5,7.

But as shown, minimal difference is 2, giving 1/216.

So, yes, 1/216 is the minimal.

Therefore, the answer is 1 + 216=217.

But hold on, wait a second. Earlier, I thought that 1/216 is the minimal, but when I did the initial analysis, I found that 24 - 30= -6, so 6/504=1/84.

But, when I switched the digits, I got 2/432=1/216.

So, 1/216 is indeed smaller.

But, is 1/216 really the minimal?

Wait, I just realized that in the case where we have numerator difference 2, we can have denominator 504 only if we can have triplet products 28 and 30, which use digits 1,4,7 and 2,3,5.

Thus, the denominator is 6×8×9=432.

Wait, not 504.

Therefore, 2/432=1/216.

But, if we can somehow get 2 in numerator with denominator 504, that would be better.

But, as we saw, triplet products don't allow that.

So, 1/216 is the minimal.

Wait, but let me think differently.

Wait, perhaps using non-consecutive triplets.

Wait, for example, triplet A:1×2× something and triplet B: something×something×something.

Wait, but we already checked that.

Alternatively, perhaps using 1,2,5 in a triplet and 3,4,6 in another.

Wait, triplet A:1×2×5=10, triplet B:3×4×6=72.

Difference:72 -10=62.

Fraction:62 / (7×8×9)=62 /504≈0.123.

Not helpful.

Wait, triplet A:1×2×6=12, triplet B:3×4×5=60.

Difference:60 -12=48.

Fraction:48 /504≈0.095.

Still worse than 1/216.

Wait, triplet A:1×3×4=12, triplet B:2×5×6=60.

Same as above.

Wait, triplet A:1×3×5=15, triplet B:2×4×6=48.

Difference:48 -15=33.

Fraction:33 /504≈0.065.

Still worse.

Wait, triplet A:1×3×6=18, triplet B:2×4×5=40.

Difference:40 -18=22.

Fraction:22 /504≈0.043.

Still worse.

Wait, triplet A:1×4×5=20, triplet B:2×3×6=36.

Difference:36 -20=16.

Fraction:16 /504≈0.0317.

Still worse.

Wait, triplet A:1×4×6=24, triplet B:2×3×5=30.

Difference:30 -24=6.

Fraction:6 /504=1/84.

Again, same as before.

Wait, triplet A:1×5×6=30, triplet B:2×3×4=24.

Same as above.

So, same result.

Therefore, 1/84 is the minimal.

But, when I considered swapping digits, using 1,4,7 and 2,3,5, leaving 6,8,9 for denominator, I got 2/432=1/216, which is smaller.

So, 1/216 is indeed smaller.

Wait, so which one is correct?

Wait, so, in effect, depending on how we split the digits, we can get 1/84 or 1/216.

Since 1/216 is smaller, that's the minimal.

But, but in the first case, we have denominator 504, but the numerator difference is 6, giving 1/84.

In the second case, we have denominator 432, numerator difference 2, giving 1/216.

So, 1/216 is smaller.

Therefore, 1/216 is the minimal positive value.

But, let me make sure.

Wait, 1/216 is approximately 0.00463.

1/84 is approximately 0.0119.

Indeed, 1/216 is smaller.

So, 1/216 is the minimal.

Therefore, m=1, n=216.

But, wait, 216 factors: 216=2^3 * 3^3.

1 and 216 are coprime.

Thus, m + n=1 + 216=217.

Therefore, the answer is 217.

But, wait, before finalizing, I just need to confirm that there isn't another way to arrange the triplets to get a smaller positive value.

Wait, for example, using triplet A:1×5×8=40, triplet B:2×3×7=42.

Difference:42 -40=2.

Denominator:4×6×9=216.

So, fraction:2 /216=1/108≈0.00926.

Which is larger than 1/216≈0.00463.

Wait, so 1/108 is larger.

Alternatively, triplet A:1×5×9=45, triplet B:2×3×8=48.

Difference:48 -45=3.

Denominator:4×6×7=168.

Fraction:3 /168=1/56≈0.0179.

Which is larger than 1/216.

Wait, triplet A:1×6×7=42, triplet B:2×3×8=48.

Difference:48 -42=6.

Denominator:4×5×9=180.

Fraction:6 /180=1/30≈0.0333.

Larger.

Wait, triplet A:1×6×8=48, triplet B:2×3×9=54.

Difference:54 -48=6.

Denominator:4×5×7=140.

Fraction:6 /140=3/70≈0.0429.

Larger.

Wait, triplet A:2×5×9=90, triplet B:3×4×8=96.

Difference:96 -90=6.

Denominator:1×6×7=42.

Fraction:6 /42=1/7≈0.1429.

Larger.

Wait, triplet A:2×5×7=70, triplet B:3×4×9=108.

Difference:108 -70=38.

Denominator:1×6×8=48.

Fraction:38 /48≈0.7917.

Larger.

Wait, triplet A:2×6×7=84, triplet B:3×4×9=108.

Difference:108 -84=24.

Denominator:1×5×8=40.

Fraction:24 /40=3/5=0.6.

Larger.

Wait, triplet A:3×5×7=105, triplet B:2×4×9=72.

Difference:105 -72=33.

Denominator:1×6×8=48.

Fraction:33 /48=11/16≈0.6875.

Larger.

Wait, triplet A:3×5×8=120, triplet B:2×4×9=72.

Difference:120 -72=48.

Denominator:1×6×7=42.

Fraction:48 /42=8/7≈1.1429.

Positive, but larger than 1.

Wait, triplet A:4×5×7=140, triplet B:2×3×9=54.

Difference:140 -54=86.

Denominator:1×6×8=48.

Fraction:86 /48≈1.7917.

Positive, but larger.

Wait, triplet A:4×5×6=120, triplet B:2×3×9=54.

Difference:120 -54=66.

Denominator:1×7×8=56.

Fraction:66 /56=33/28≈1.1786.

Positive, larger.

Wait, triplet A:5×6×7=210, triplet B:2×3×9=54.

Difference:210 -54=156.

Denominator:1×4×8=32.

Fraction:156 /32=39/8≈4.875.

Positive, but larger.

So, seems like all other arrangements give a larger fraction than 1/216.

Thus, I think 1/216 is indeed the minimal positive value.

Therefore, m=1, n=216, so m + n=217.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{217}
</think>

To solve the problem, we need to find the minimum possible positive value of the expression:

\[
\dfrac{a \cdot b \cdot c - d \cdot e \cdot f}{g \cdot h \cdot i}
\]

where \(a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i\) are distinct integers from 1 to 9. We aim to minimize the numerator \(a \cdot b \cdot c - d \cdot e \cdot f\) and maximize the denominator \(g \cdot h \cdot i\).

### Key Steps:

1. **Maximizing the Denominator**:
   - The largest product of three distinct digits from 1 to 9 is \(7 \cdot 8 \cdot 9 = 504\).

2. **Minimizing the Numerator**:
   - We need two sets of three distinct digits each, such that their products have the smallest possible positive difference.
   - After evaluating various combinations, the smallest positive difference found is 2, achieved by the products \(28\) and \(30\).

3. **Checking Digit Usage**:
   - The digits used for the numerator (28 and 30) are 1, 4, 7 and 2, 3, 5 respectively. These do not overlap, allowing the remaining digits 6, 8, and 9 to be used in the denominator.

4. **Calculating the Fraction**:
   - The numerator difference is \(30 - 28 = 2\).
   - The denominator is \(6 \cdot 8 \cdot 9 = 432\).
   - Thus, the fraction is \(\frac{2}{432} = \frac{1}{216}\).

5. **Simplifying the Fraction**:
   - The fraction \(\frac{1}{216}\) is already in its simplest form, where \(m = 1\) and \(n = 216\).

6. **Final Result**:
   - The sum \(m + n = 1 + 216 = 217\).

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{217}
\]
