 The problem: 
Let $S$ be the set of all positive rational numbers $r$ such that when the two numbers $r$ and $55r$ are written as fractions in lowest terms, the sum of the numerator and denominator of one fraction is the same as the sum of the numerator and denominator of the other fraction. The sum of all the elements of $S$ can be expressed in the form $\frac{p}{q},$ where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q.$


Okay, so I need to solve this problem where we have a set S consisting of all positive rational numbers r such that when we write both r and 55r as fractions in their lowest terms, the sum of the numerator and denominator of one fraction is equal to the sum of the numerator and denominator of the other. Then, we need to find the sum of all elements in S and express it as p/q where p and q are coprime, then find p + q.

Alright, let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let's denote r as a positive rational number. Since r is positive, we don't have to worry about negative values or zero. Let's write r as a reduced fraction, say a/b, where a and b are coprime positive integers (i.e., gcd(a, b) = 1). So, r = a/b.

Then, 55r would be 55*(a/b) = (55a)/b. However, 55a/b might not be in its lowest terms yet because 55 could share factors with b. So, to write 55r in lowest terms, we need to divide both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor. Let's denote d = gcd(55a, b). Therefore, the reduced form of 55r would be (55a/d)/(b/d).

So, now we have two fractions in lowest terms:

- r = a/b

- 55r = (55a/d)/(b/d), where d = gcd(55a, b)

According to the problem statement, the sum of the numerator and denominator of one fraction is equal to the sum of the numerator and denominator of the other. That means either:

1. a + b = (55a/d) + (b/d), or

2. a + b = (b/d) + (55a/d), but wait, that's the same as the first equation.

Wait, no, hold on. The other possibility is that the sum for r is equal to the sum for 55r, which is exactly what I just wrote. So, either way, it's the same equation: a + b = (55a/d) + (b/d).

Alternatively, since d is a common divisor, maybe there's another case where the sums are equal but in reverse? But no, because addition is commutative, so the order doesn't matter. So, essentially, the condition is a + b = (55a + b)/d.

Therefore, we can write the equation:

a + b = (55a + b)/d.

Multiply both sides by d:

d(a + b) = 55a + b.

So, d(a + b) = 55a + b.

Let's rearrange terms:

d(a + b) - 55a - b = 0

Which can be rewritten as:

(d - 55)a + (d - 1)b = 0

Hmm, interesting. So, (d - 55)a + (d - 1)b = 0.

But since a and b are positive integers, and d is a positive integer (as it's a gcd), we can analyze this equation.

We have (d - 55)a = -(d - 1)b

Thus,

(d - 55)a = (1 - d)b

Note that d divides both 55a and b, so d must be a divisor of 55a and d must divide b.

But since a and b are coprime (because r = a/b is in lowest terms), any common divisor of 55a and b must divide 55 and b, but since a and b are coprime, gcd(55a, b) = gcd(55, b). Because if a and b are coprime, then the common divisors come only from 55 and b.

Wait, let me think again.

Given that r = a/b is in lowest terms, so gcd(a, b) = 1. Then, 55a and b may share a common divisor. Since 55 is 5*11, the gcd(55a, b) is equal to gcd(55, b)*gcd(a, b) = gcd(55, b)*1 = gcd(55, b). So, d = gcd(55, b). So, d is a divisor of 55, i.e., d can be 1, 5, 11, or 55.

Therefore, possible values of d are 1, 5, 11, 55.

So, let's note that d ∈ {1, 5, 11, 55}.

So, going back to our equation:

(d - 55)a = (1 - d)b

Which can be written as:

( d - 55 )a = (1 - d )b

Or,

( d - 55 )a + ( d - 1 )b = 0

But since d is known to be 1, 5, 11, or 55, we can substitute each value and see what constraints we get on a and b.

Case 1: d = 1

Substituting d=1 into the equation:

(1 - 55)a + (1 - 1)b = (-54)a + 0*b = -54a = 0

Which implies that -54a = 0, so a = 0. But a is a positive integer (since r is positive rational number), so this case gives no solution.

Case 2: d = 5

Substituting d=5:

(5 - 55)a + (5 - 1)b = (-50)a + 4b = 0

So, -50a + 4b = 0 => 4b = 50a => 2b = 25a.

Since a and b are coprime, 25 must divide b, and 2 must divide a.

Let me write this as:

25 divides b, so let’s set b = 25k for some integer k ≥1.

Similarly, 2 divides a, so let’s set a = 2m for some integer m ≥1.

But since a and b are coprime, we have gcd(a, b) = gcd(2m, 25k) = gcd(2m, 25k). Since 2 and 25 are coprime, this is equal to gcd(m, k) * gcd(2, 25) = gcd(m, k)*1 = gcd(m, k). Since a and b are coprime, we must have gcd(m, k) = 1.

From earlier, we had 2b =25a.

Substituting a=2m and b=25k:

2*(25k) = 25*(2m) => 50k = 50m => k = m.

But since gcd(m, k)=1, and k=m, that implies m=1 and k=1.

Therefore, a = 2*1 = 2, b =25*1=25.

Thus, in this case, r = a/b = 2/25.

Case 3: d = 11

Substituting d=11:

(11 -55)a + (11 -1)b = (-44)a +10b = 0

So, -44a +10b =0 => 10b =44a => 5b=22a.

Again, since a and b are coprime, 22 divides b, and 5 divides a.

So, set b=22k, a=5m.

Then, gcd(a,b)=gcd(5m,22k)=1. Since 5 and 22 are coprime, this requires that gcd(m,k)=1.

From 5b =22a:

5*(22k) =22*(5m) => 110k=110m => k =m.

Therefore, similar to above, since gcd(m, k)=1, m=k=1.

Hence, a=5*1=5, b=22*1=22.

Thus, r=5/22.

Case 4: d=55

Substituting d=55:

(55 -55)a + (55 -1)b = 0*a +54b=0

So, 54b=0, implying b=0. But b is a positive integer, so no solution here.

Therefore, the only solutions occur when d=5 and d=11, leading to r=2/25 and r=5/22.

So, set S consists of these two elements: {2/25, 5/22}

Now, we need to compute the sum of all elements in S.

Sum = 2/25 + 5/22

To add these fractions, we'll find a common denominator. The denominators are 25 and 22, which are coprime, so the least common denominator is 25*22=550.

Convert each fraction:

2/25 = (2*22)/(25*22) = 44/550

5/22 = (5*25)/(22*25) = 125/550

Adding them together: 44/550 +125/550=169/550

Check if 169 and 550 are coprime. Factorize 169: 13^2. Factorize 550: 2*5^2*11. They share no common prime factors, so yes, 169 and 550 are coprime.

Thus, the sum is 169/550, so p=169, q=550. Then, p+q=169+550=719.

Wait, before I conclude, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First, I considered r=a/b in lowest terms, found 55r=(55a)/b, simplified it to (55a/d)/(b/d), where d=gcd(55a, b). Then, set up the equation a + b = (55a + b)/d, which led to d(a + b) =55a + b, resulting in (d-55)a + (d -1)b=0.

Then, considering d as a divisor of 55, so d∈{1,5,11,55}. For each d, substituted and solved for a and b under the constraint that they are coprime.

For d=1: led to a=0, invalid.

For d=5: led to a=2, b=25, which seems correct.

For d=11: led to a=5, b=22, which also seems correct.

For d=55: led to b=0, invalid.

Calculating the sum: 2/25 +5/22= (44 +125)/550=169/550.

Yes, that seems correct.

So, p=169, q=550, which are coprime. Hence, p+q=719.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{719}
</think>

Let \( S \) be the set of all positive rational numbers \( r \) such that when \( r \) and \( 55r \) are written as fractions in lowest terms, the sum of the numerator and denominator of one fraction is the same as the sum of the numerator and denominator of the other. We need to find the sum of all elements of \( S \) and express it as \( \frac{p}{q} \), where \( p \) and \( q \) are relatively prime positive integers, and then find \( p + q \).

First, denote \( r \) as a reduced fraction \( \frac{a}{b} \) where \( a \) and \( b \) are coprime positive integers. Then, \( 55r \) would be \( \frac{55a}{b} \), which simplifies to \( \frac{55a/d}{b/d} \) where \( d = \gcd(55a, b) \).

The condition given is that the sum of the numerator and denominator of one fraction equals the sum of the numerator and denominator of the other. This leads to the equation:
\[ a + b = \frac{55a + b}{d} \]

Multiplying both sides by \( d \) gives:
\[ d(a + b) = 55a + b \]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[ (d - 55)a + (d - 1)b = 0 \]

Since \( d \) must be a divisor of 55, the possible values of \( d \) are 1, 5, 11, and 55. We analyze each case:

- **Case 1: \( d = 1 \)** leads to \( a = 0 \), which is invalid.
- **Case 2: \( d = 5 \)** gives \( -50a + 4b = 0 \) leading to \( 2b = 25a \). Solving, we find \( a = 2 \) and \( b = 25 \), giving \( r = \frac{2}{25} \).
- **Case 3: \( d = 11 \)** gives \( -44a + 10b = 0 \) leading to \( 5b = 22a \). Solving, we find \( a = 5 \) and \( b = 22 \), giving \( r = \frac{5}{22} \).
- **Case 4: \( d = 55 \)** leads to \( b = 0 \), which is invalid.

Thus, the set \( S \) consists of \( \frac{2}{25} \) and \( \frac{5}{22} \). Summing these elements:
\[ \frac{2}{25} + \frac{5}{22} = \frac{44}{550} + \frac{125}{550} = \frac{169}{550} \]

Since 169 and 550 are coprime, the sum is \( \frac{169}{550} \). Therefore, \( p = 169 \) and \( q = 550 \), giving \( p + q = 719 \).

\[
\boxed{719}
\]
