 The problem: 
There is a collection of $25$ indistinguishable white chips and $25$ indistinguishable black chips. Find the number of ways to place some of these chips in the $25$ unit cells of a $5\times5$ grid such that: 

each cell contains at most one chip
all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour
any additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions.


<think>
Alright, let me try to figure out this problem. So, we have a 5x5 grid, which means there are 25 cells. We need to place some chips—either white or black—into these cells with certain conditions.

First, each cell can have at most one chip. That's straightforward; no overlapping chips.

Second, all chips in the same row must be the same color, and similarly, all chips in the same column must also be the same color. Hmm, that seems a bit tricky because if every row has to be monochromatic and every column as well, how does that interact? 

Wait, so if I have a row where all chips are white, then every column that intersects this row must either have all white chips or none? Because otherwise, a column could end up having both white and black chips if it intersects different colored rows. Similarly, if a row is black, all columns intersecting it must be entirely black. Is that right?

Let me think. Suppose I have a row with white chips. Then any column that passes through that row must either have all white chips (so that column is consistent) or zero chips. If it had some black chips in another row, that would conflict because the column already has white chips from the first row. So, yes, for each row, if it's white, then every column that intersects it must either have all white chips or remain empty.

Similarly, if a row is black, then every column intersecting it must be all black or empty.

Therefore, this seems like a constraint that the coloring of the grid is determined by selecting certain rows and columns to be white or black, but once you choose a row's color, all columns intersecting it must either be all white (if the row is white) or all black (if the row is black), except those columns might not necessarily be all the way across, but wait, actually, no—if a row is white, the entire column where that row is located must be white? Or just that intersection?

Wait, maybe not the entire column, but any chip in that column must match the row's color. So, if a particular row is white, then any column that has a chip in that row must be entirely white. But columns without a chip in that row can still be whatever color? No, hold on—the condition says "all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour." So, if a column has a chip in a row that's white, then that column must be entirely white.

But what if a column doesn't have any chips in that row? Then the column can be either color, as long as all its chips are the same color. Wait, but the condition is about chips in the same row or same column. So, if a column has multiple chips, they must all be the same color. Similarly, if a row has multiple chips, they must all be the same color. However, a row and a column can intersect at a single cell—if that cell is occupied, then the entire row and the entire column must be that color.

Wait, maybe it's better to model this as a bipartite graph where rows and columns are nodes, and cells are edges. Then, placing a chip in a cell is like selecting an edge, and the constraints are that if an edge is selected, then all edges adjacent to its row node must be the same color, and all edges adjacent to its column node must be the same color.

This is getting abstract, but perhaps it's similar to a constraint satisfaction problem where choosing a value for one variable affects others. Maybe we can model it as a matrix where each row and each column is assigned a color, and each cell can only be the color of its row or column.

But since each cell can only have one chip, which color it takes depends on whether the row or the column is assigned that color. Wait, perhaps the colors of the rows and columns determine the color of each cell.

If a cell is occupied, then the color of the cell must equal both the color of its row and the color of its column. Therefore, if a row is white and a column is black, their intersection cannot have a chip because that would require the cell to be both white and black. Hence, the intersection must be empty if the row and column have different colors.

Alternatively, if a row is white and a column is white, their intersection can have a chip (white). Similarly, if a row is black and a column is black, their intersection can have a chip (black). If a row is white and a column is black, or vice versa, their intersection cannot have a chip.

So, essentially, the grid can be partitioned into four regions based on the colors of the rows and columns:

1. White rows and white columns: cells here can have white chips.
2. White rows and black columns: cells here must be empty.
3. Black rows and white columns: cells here must be empty.
4. Black rows and black columns: cells here can have black chips.

Furthermore, within each region, the chips must be placed consistently. For example, in region 1 (white rows and white columns), all chips placed there must be white. Similarly, in region 4, all chips must be black.

Now, the problem asks for the number of ways to place some chips in the grid satisfying these conditions, with the additional constraint that adding any more chip would violate one of the previous conditions. So, the placement must be maximal—no more chips can be added without violating the row or column monochromaticity.

To rephrase, we need to count all possible maximal placements under these constraints.

Given that, perhaps we can model this as selecting subsets of rows and columns to be white or black, such that the corresponding intersections (regions 1 and 4) form a subgrid where chips can be placed, and the rest must be empty. Moreover, the placement must be maximal, meaning that every possible cell in the regions 1 and 4 either has a chip or adding a chip there would violate the row or column constraints.

Wait, but in our earlier analysis, in regions 1 and 4, cells can have chips, but the rest must be empty. So, the placement is entirely determined by the sets of white rows and white columns (which defines region 1) and black rows and black columns (which defines region 4). However, if a cell is in region 1, it can have a white chip, but if it's in region 4, it can have a black chip.

But then, how do these regions overlap? Actually, region 1 is white rows and white columns, region 4 is black rows and black columns, and regions 2 and 3 are white-black or black-white, which must be empty.

Therefore, the grid is divided into four blocks:

- Top-left: white rows and white columns (can have white chips)
- Top-right: white rows and black columns (must be empty)
- Bottom-left: black rows and white columns (must be empty)
- Bottom-right: black rows and black columns (can have black chips)

Thus, the non-empty regions are top-left and bottom-right.

Moreover, within these regions, the chips must be placed such that every row and column within the region is monochromatic. But since the entire region is either white or black, the placement within the region must satisfy that every row and column is filled consistently.

But wait, actually, within the top-left region (white rows and white columns), each row (which is white) can have any number of chips, as long as all chips in that row are white. Similarly, each column (which is white) can have any number of chips, all white.

However, since the entire top-left region is white, any chip placed in that region must be white, and any chip in the bottom-right must be black.

But the problem allows us to place some chips—so we can choose any subset of the top-left and bottom-right regions, provided that the placement is maximal. That is, we can't add any more chips without violating the row or column monochromaticity.

Hmm, okay, so let me consider that.

First, the total number of possible configurations is determined by choosing subsets of rows and columns to be white or black, which in turn defines the regions where chips can be placed.

Each row can independently be white or black, and each column can independently be white or black. However, if a row is white, then all columns intersecting it in the top-left region must allow white chips, but the bottom-right region (black rows and black columns) must be empty if the row is white.

Wait, no—if a row is white, then the columns that are white can have chips in the top-left, but the columns that are black cannot have any chips in the row because that would create a contradiction.

Similarly, if a row is black, then the columns that are white cannot have any chips in that row, but the columns that are black can have chips.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model the problem as follows:

Each row can be either white or black. Each column can be either white or black. However, the following must hold: If a row is white, then all columns that are white must have their intersection cells (top-left region) possibly containing chips, but the black columns must be empty in that row. Similarly, if a row is black, then all white columns must be empty in that row.

But actually, considering the problem statement again: All chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same color. So, if a row has any chips, all its chips must be the same color. Similarly, if a column has any chips, all its chips must be the same color.

Additionally, any additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions.

So, the key point is that the current placement is maximal—that is, you can't add any more chips without violating the row or column monochromaticity.

Therefore, for each row and column, if it's white, then all cells in that row must be white if they are in a white column, but if a column is black, then the intersection cell cannot have a chip. Similarly for black rows.

Hence, the placement is determined by selecting for each row whether it is white or black, and for each column whether it is white or black, such that the intersection cells (where both row and column are white) can have chips, while the other intersections must be empty.

But the placement must be maximal, so that in every row and column, if it's white, then every possible cell in that row or column that can have a chip must have a chip—or else it wouldn't be maximal.

Wait, no—if a row is white, then you can choose to place some chips in the white columns, but to make it maximal, you must place chips in all possible cells in that row and column that can have chips. Otherwise, you could add more chips, which would mean the placement isn't maximal.

Wait, perhaps that's the case. So, if a row is white, and there exists a white column, then the intersection cell can have a chip. To make the placement maximal, you must place a chip in every possible intersection cell in that row and column.

But wait, no—if a row is white, but a column is black, their intersection cannot have a chip, regardless. So, for a row to be white, all the cells in that row that are in white columns must have chips. Otherwise, you could add chips there, which would violate the maximality.

Similarly, for a column to be white, all the cells in that column that are in white rows must have chips. Otherwise, you could add chips there.

Hence, for the placement to be maximal, for every white row, every white column must have a chip in their intersection, and for every white column, every white row must have a chip in their intersection.

Therefore, the number of maximal placements is equal to the number of ways to choose subsets of rows and columns such that the corresponding white rows and white columns intersect completely—i.e., every white row has chips in every white column, and every white column has chips in every white row.

But also, note that black rows and black columns can have chips too—but if a row is black, then the chips in that row must be in black columns. Similarly, if a column is black, the chips must be in black rows.

However, to make the placement maximal, if a row is black, all the black columns must have chips in that row, and if a column is black, all the black rows must have chips in that column.

Wait, but hang on—if a row is black, then the cells in that row that are in black columns must have chips, otherwise, you could add chips there. Similarly, for a column being black, the cells in that column that are in black rows must have chips.

Therefore, for the placement to be maximal, the set of white rows and white columns must form a rectangle covering all intersections between them, i.e., a complete rectangle of white cells, and similarly, the set of black rows and black columns must form a complete rectangle of black cells.

Moreover, these two rectangles must not overlap because if a cell is in both a white row and a black column, or a black row and a white column, it cannot have a chip.

Hence, the maximal placements correspond to choosing a rectangle of white cells (a set of white rows and white columns forming a rectangle) and a disjoint rectangle of black cells (a set of black rows and black columns forming a rectangle), such that the white and black rectangles don't overlap.

But since the grid is 5x5, the white rectangle can be any size from 0x0 up to 5x5, and similarly, the black rectangle can be any size from 0x0 up to 5x5, but they cannot overlap.

But wait, actually, the white rectangle is defined by selecting some rows and some columns, and the black rectangle is defined by the remaining rows and columns. So, the white rectangle is a subgrid defined by a subset of rows R and a subset of columns C, and the black rectangle is defined by the complement of R and the complement of C.

Moreover, for the placement to be maximal, we cannot have any extra chips outside these two rectangles. So, the white rectangle must cover all possible white cells, and the black rectangle must cover all possible black cells.

But in order to maximize the placement, we must fill all possible cells in the white rectangle and the black rectangle.

But wait, if we choose a white rectangle, say, consisting of rows R and columns C, then we must place a chip in every cell (r,c) where r ∈ R and c ∈ C. Similarly, if we choose a black rectangle consisting of rows B and columns D, we must place a chip in every cell (b,d) where b ∈ B and d ∈ D. But since R and B are complements, and C and D are complements, the black rectangle is determined once the white rectangle is chosen.

But we have to ensure that the white rectangle and black rectangle do not overlap. That is, R ∩ B = empty and C ∩ D = empty, which is naturally satisfied because R and B are complements, and C and D are complements.

However, we also have to ensure that the white rectangle and black rectangle do not interfere with each other. Specifically, a cell cannot be in both a white row and a black column, or a black row and a white column, because that would make it impossible to have a chip there.

But in our setup, since the white rectangle is R x C and the black rectangle is B x D, with R = complement of B and C = complement of D, the black rectangle is automatically in the complement of the white rectangle.

Therefore, the placement is determined entirely by choosing R and C, the sets of white rows and white columns. Once R and C are chosen, the white rectangle is R x C, and the black rectangle is (complement of R) x (complement of C).

Moreover, the white rectangle must cover all possible cells in R x C, and the black rectangle must cover all possible cells in (complement of R) x (complement of C). Since the problem requires that the placement is maximal, we cannot have any additional chips beyond these.

Therefore, the number of maximal placements is equal to the number of ways to choose R and C, which are subsets of the rows and columns respectively, such that the resulting white rectangle and black rectangle do not interfere.

But actually, R and C can be any subsets, and each choice of R and C gives a unique maximal placement. So, the number of such placements is equal to the number of choices for R multiplied by the number of choices for C.

Since there are 5 rows, the number of subsets R is 2^5. Similarly, the number of subsets C is 2^5. Therefore, the total number of maximal placements would be 2^5 * 2^5 = 2^10 = 1024.

Wait, but hold on. Is that correct? Because in our earlier analysis, we considered that R and C define the white rectangle, and the black rectangle is automatically determined. So, each pair (R,C) corresponds to exactly one maximal placement. Therefore, the total number is indeed 2^5 * 2^5 = 1024.

But let me verify. For each row, decide whether it's white or black (2^5 options), and for each column, decide whether it's white or black (2^5 options). Each such combination defines a unique maximal placement where the white rows and white columns have all their possible cells filled, and the black rows and black columns have all their possible cells filled. The cells in mixed regions are left empty, and since we've filled all possible cells in the white and black regions, the placement is maximal.

Yes, that makes sense. Each maximal placement is uniquely determined by the choice of white rows and white columns, which in turn defines the black rows and black columns as their complements. Hence, the number of such placements is 2^5 * 2^5 = 1024.

However, wait a second. The problem states that we are placing some chips in the grid, meaning that we can have zero chips as well. So, is the case where R is empty and C is empty included? Yes, that would correspond to placing zero chips, which is a valid maximal placement because there are no additional chips that can be added.

Similarly, cases where R is non-empty or C is non-empty, but not both, are also valid, but in reality, both R and C must be non-empty to have any chips. Wait, no—if R is non-empty and C is non-empty, then the white rectangle will have chips. If R is empty or C is empty, the white rectangle is empty. Similarly, if both R and C are non-empty, the white rectangle is non-empty, and the black rectangle may or may not be non-empty depending on whether the complements are non-empty.

Wait, actually, the black rectangle is (complement of R) x (complement of C). So, even if R and C are non-empty, their complements could be empty. For example, if R includes all rows, then the complement is empty, so the black rectangle is empty. Similarly, if C includes all columns, the black rectangle is empty.

Therefore, the number of maximal placements is indeed 2^5 * 2^5 = 1024. Because each of the 5 rows can independently be white or black, and each of the 5 columns can independently be white or black, leading to 2^5 * 2^5 possibilities.

But let me check if this overcounts. For instance, suppose R is empty and C is empty. This corresponds to placing zero chips, which is allowed. Similarly, if R is all white and C is all white, then the white rectangle is the entire grid, and the black rectangle is empty. Alternatively, if R is all black and C is all black, the black rectangle is the entire grid, and the white rectangle is empty. These are distinct placements.

Another test case: suppose R is {row1} and C is {column1}. Then, the white rectangle is row1 and column1, so only cell (1,1) is filled. The black rectangle is rows 2-5 and columns 2-5, so the remaining 16 cells are filled with black chips. Thus, this is a valid maximal placement.

Similarly, if R is {row1, row2} and C is {column3, column4}, then the white rectangle is rows1-2 and columns3-4, so 4 cells filled with white chips. The black rectangle is rows3-5 and columns1-2 and columns5, so the remaining cells (excluding the white rectangle) are filled with black chips. Again, a valid maximal placement.

Therefore, each choice of R and C indeed leads to a unique maximal placement, and all such placements are counted by 2^5 * 2^5.

But wait, another thought: is the case where R is empty and C is non-empty a separate case from R being non-empty and C empty? Yes, because in the first case, all rows are black, so the black rectangle is the entire grid, and the white rectangle is empty. In the latter case, all columns are black, so the black rectangle is empty, and the white rectangle is the entire grid. These are distinct configurations unless all rows and columns are black or white, but in general, they're different.

Therefore, I think my initial conclusion is correct: the number of maximal placements is 2^5 * 2^5 = 1024.

But let me double-check if this counts correctly. For each row, we decide independently whether it's white or black. So, 2^5 = 32 choices for rows. Similarly, 2^5 = 32 choices for columns. Multiplying them together gives 32*32=1024.

Yes, that seems accurate.

**Final Answer**
The number of ways is \boxed{1024}.
</think>

We need to find the number of ways to place some chips in a 5x5 grid such that each cell contains at most one chip, all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same color, and any additional chip placed would violate one or more of these conditions.

Key steps:
1. Each cell can contain at most one chip.
2. All chips in the same row must be the same color.
3. All chips in the same column must be the same color.
4. The placement must be maximal, meaning no additional chips can be added without violating the row or column monochromaticity.

The grid is divided into four regions based on the colors of the rows and columns:
- White rows and white columns (cells can have white chips).
- White rows and black columns (cells must be empty).
- Black rows and white columns (cells must be empty).
- Black rows and black columns (cells can have black chips).

To maximize the placement, we must fill all possible cells in the white and black regions. Each maximal placement is determined by choosing subsets of rows and columns to be white or black. The number of such subsets for rows is \(2^5\) and for columns is \(2^5\). Therefore, the total number of maximal placements is \(2^5 \times 2^5 = 1024\).

\[
\boxed{1024}
