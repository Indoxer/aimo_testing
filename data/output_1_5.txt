 The problem: 
Three spheres with radii $11$, $13$, and $19$ are mutually externally tangent. A plane intersects the spheres in three congruent circles centered at $A$, $B$, and $C$, respectively, and the centers of the spheres all lie on the same side of this plane. Suppose that $AB^2 = 560$. Find $AC^2$.


To solve the problem, we start by visualizing the setup. We have three spheres with radii \(11\), \(13\), and \(19\) that are mutually externally tangent. A plane intersects these spheres in three congruent circles centered at points \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\) respectively. The centers of the spheres all lie on the same side of this plane. We are given that \(AB^2 = 560\) and need to find \(AC^2\).

First, let's denote the centers of the spheres as \(O_1\), \(O_2\), and \(O_3\) with radii \(r_1 = 11\), \(r_2 = 13\), and \(r_3 = 19\) respectively. Since the spheres are mutually externally tangent, the distances between their centers are:
\[
O_1O_2 = r_1 + r_2 = 11 + 13 = 24,
\]
\[
O_1O_3 = r_1 + r_3 = 11 + 19 = 30,
\]
\[
O_2O_3 = r_2 + r_3 = 13 + 19 = 32.
\]

The plane intersects the spheres in congruent circles, so the distances from the centers of the spheres to the plane are equal. Let these distances be \(d_1\), \(d_2\), and \(d_3\) for the spheres with radii \(r_1\), \(r_2\), and \(r_3\) respectively. The radii of the circles of intersection are then:
\[
\sqrt{r_1^2 - d_1^2}, \quad \sqrt{r_2^2 - d_2^2}, \quad \sqrt{r_3^2 - d_3^2}.
\]
Since the circles are congruent, we have:
\[
\sqrt{r_1^2 - d_1^2} = \sqrt{r_2^2 - d_2^2} = \sqrt{r_3^2 - d_3^2} = k,
\]
for some constant \(k\). Therefore, we can write:
\[
r_1^2 - d_1^2 = r_2^2 - d_2^2 = r_3^2 - d_3^2 = k^2.
\]
This implies:
\[
d_1^2 = r_1^2 - k^2, \quad d_2^2 = r_2^2 - k^2, \quad d_3^2 = r_3^2 - k^2.
\]

We are given that \(AB^2 = 560\). The distance \(AB\) is the distance between the centers of the circles of intersection, which is the same as the distance between the projections of the centers of the spheres onto the plane. This distance is the same as the distance between the centers of the spheres minus twice the radius of the circles of intersection:
\[
AB^2 = (O_1O_2)^2 - 4k^2 = 24^2 - 4k^2 = 576 - 4k^2.
\]
Given \(AB^2 = 560\), we have:
\[
576 - 4k^2 = 560 \implies 4k^2 = 16 \implies k^2 = 4.
\]

Now, we need to find \(AC^2\). Using the same logic, we have:
\[
AC^2 = (O_1O_3)^2 - 4k^2 = 30^2 - 4k^2 = 900 - 4 \cdot 4 = 900 - 16 = 884.
\]

Thus, the value of \(AC^2\) is:
\[
\boxed{884}.
\]
