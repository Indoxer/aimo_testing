 The problem: 
Let $w = \dfrac{\sqrt{3} + i}{2}$ and $z = \dfrac{-1 + i\sqrt{3}}{2},$ where $i = \sqrt{-1}.$ Find the number of ordered pairs $(r,s)$ of positive integers not exceeding $100$ that satisfy the equation $i \cdot w^r = z^s.$


To solve the problem, we first need to express \( w \) and \( z \) in polar form. We start with \( w = \frac{\sqrt{3} + i}{2} \). The modulus of \( w \) is:
\[
|w| = \sqrt{\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2} = \sqrt{\frac{3}{4} + \frac{1}{4}} = \sqrt{1} = 1.
\]
The argument of \( w \) is:
\[
\arg(w) = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{1/2}{\sqrt{3}/2}\right) = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\right) = \frac{\pi}{6}.
\]
Thus, we can write \( w \) as:
\[
w = e^{i\pi/6}.
\]

Next, we consider \( z = \frac{-1 + i\sqrt{3}}{2} \). The modulus of \( z \) is:
\[
|z| = \sqrt{\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{4} + \frac{3}{4}} = \sqrt{1} = 1.
\]
The argument of \( z \) is:
\[
\arg(z) = \pi - \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}/2}{1/2}\right) = \pi - \tan^{-1}(\sqrt{3}) = \pi - \frac{\pi}{3} = \frac{2\pi}{3}.
\]
Thus, we can write \( z \) as:
\[
z = e^{i2\pi/3}.
\]

We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((r, s)\) of positive integers not exceeding 100 that satisfy the equation \( i \cdot w^r = z^s \). First, we express \( i \) in polar form:
\[
i = e^{i\pi/2}.
\]
Thus, the equation becomes:
\[
e^{i\pi/2} \cdot e^{ir\pi/6} = e^{is2\pi/3}.
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
e^{i(\pi/2 + r\pi/6)} = e^{is2\pi/3}.
\]
Since the exponents must be equal modulo \( 2\pi \), we have:
\[
\frac{\pi}{2} + \frac{r\pi}{6} = \frac{2s\pi}{3} + 2k\pi \quad \text{for some integer } k.
\]
Dividing through by \( \pi \), we get:
\[
\frac{1}{2} + \frac{r}{6} = \frac{2s}{3} + 2k.
\]
Multiplying through by 6, we obtain:
\[
3 + r = 4s + 12k.
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
r = 4s + 12k - 3.
\]
For \( r \) to be a positive integer not exceeding 100, \( 4s + 12k - 3 \) must be a positive integer not exceeding 100. This means:
\[
1 \leq 4s + 12k - 3 \leq 100.
\]
Adding 3 to all parts of the inequality, we get:
\[
4 \leq 4s + 12k \leq 103.
\]
Dividing through by 4, we get:
\[
1 \leq s + 3k \leq 25.75.
\]
Since \( s \) and \( k \) are integers, we have:
\[
1 \leq s + 3k \leq 25.
\]
For each integer value of \( s \) from 1 to 25, \( k \) can take any integer value such that \( 1 \leq s + 3k \leq 25 \). This gives us the range for \( k \):
\[
\frac{s-1}{3} \leq k \leq \frac{25-s}{3}.
\]
The number of integer values for \( k \) is:
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{25-s}{3} \right\rfloor - \left\lceil \frac{s-1}{3} \right\rceil + 1.
\]
We need to check the bounds for \( s \). For \( s = 1 \), \( k \) ranges from 0 to 8, giving 9 values. For \( s = 2 \), \( k \) ranges from 0 to 8, giving 9 values. For \( s = 3 \), \( k \) ranges from 1 to 8, giving 8 values. For \( s = 4 \), \( k \) ranges from 1 to 8, giving 8 values. For \( s = 5 \), \( k \) ranges from 1 to 8, giving 8 values. For \( s = 6 \), \( k \) ranges from 2 to 8, giving 7 values. For \( s = 7 \), \( k \) ranges from 2 to 8, giving 7 values. For \( s = 8 \), \( k \) ranges from 2 to 8, giving 7 values. For \( s = 9 \), \( k \) ranges from 3 to 8, giving 6 values. For \( s = 10 \), \( k \) ranges from 3 to 8, giving 6 values. For \( s = 11 \), \( k \) ranges from 3 to 8, giving 6 values. For \( s = 12 \), \( k \) ranges from 4 to 8, giving 5 values. For \( s = 13 \), \( k \) ranges from 4 to 8, giving 5 values. For \( s = 14 \), \( k \) ranges from 4 to 8, giving 5 values. For \( s = 15 \), \( k \) ranges from 5 to 8, giving 4 values. For \( s = 16 \), \( k \) ranges from 5 to 8, giving 4 values. For \( s = 17 \), \( k \) ranges from 5 to 8, giving 4 values. For \( s = 18 \), \( k \) ranges from 6 to 8, giving 3 values. For \( s = 19 \), \( k \) ranges from 6 to 8, giving 3 values. For \( s = 20 \), \( k \) ranges from 6 to 8, giving 3 values. For \( s = 21 \), \( k \) ranges from 7 to 8, giving 2 values. For \( s = 22 \), \( k \) ranges from 7 to 8, giving 2 values. For \( s = 23 \), \( k \) ranges from 7 to 8, giving 2 values. For \( s = 24 \), \( k \) ranges from 8 to 8, giving 1 value. For \( s = 25 \), \( k \) ranges from 8 to 8, giving 1 value. Summing these values, we get:
\[
9 + 9 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 7 + 7 + 7 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 100.
\]
Thus, the number of ordered pairs \((r, s)\) is \(\boxed{100}\).
