 The problem: 
Find the number of positive integers $n \le 600$ whose value can be uniquely determined when the values of $\left\lfloor \frac n4\right\rfloor$, $\left\lfloor\frac n5\right\rfloor$, and $\left\lfloor\frac n6\right\rfloor$ are given, where $\lfloor x \rfloor$ denotes the greatest integer less than or equal to the real number $x$.


<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out how many positive integers \( n \) less than or equal to 600 have a unique value when we know the floor values \( \left\lfloor \frac{n}{4} \right\rfloor \), \( \left\lfloor \frac{n}{5} \right\rfloor \), and \( \left\lfloor \frac{n}{6} \right\rfloor \). That means if someone gives me these three floor values, there should only be one possible \( n \) that fits all three conditions. 

First, let me understand what it means for \( n \) to be uniquely determined by its floor divisions by 4, 5, and 6. Essentially, knowing these three floors tells us something about the intervals in which \( n \) lies. If these intervals intersect at exactly one integer, then \( n \) is uniquely determined.

So, maybe I can approach this by considering the ranges each floor function imposes on \( n \). For each \( n \), \( \left\lfloor \frac{n}{4} \right\rfloor = k \) implies \( 4k \leq n < 4(k+1) \). Similarly, \( \left\lfloor \frac{n}{5} \right\rfloor = m \) implies \( 5m \leq n < 5(m+1) \), and \( \left\lfloor \frac{n}{6} \right\rfloor = p \) implies \( 6p \leq n < 6(p+1) \).

Therefore, combining these, \( n \) must lie in the intersection of all three intervals: \( [4k, 4(k+1)) \cap [5m, 5(m+1)) \cap [6p, 6(p+1)) \). For \( n \) to be uniquely determined, this intersection must contain exactly one integer.

So, my task reduces to finding all \( n \leq 600 \) such that the intersection of their respective intervals from the three floor functions contains only one integer.

Hmm, but how do I systematically find these \( n \)?

Maybe I can think about the least common multiple (LCM) of 4, 5, and 6 because they are the denominators here. The LCM of 4, 5, and 6 is 60. So perhaps every 60 numbers, the pattern repeats? That might help.

Let me test this idea. If I consider \( n \) modulo 60, since 60 is the LCM, the behavior of the floor functions will repeat every 60 numbers. Therefore, if I can determine how many numbers between 1 and 60 satisfy the condition of having a unique \( n \) given their floor values, I can multiply that count by 10 (since 600 divided by 60 is 10) to get the total count up to 600.

But before jumping into that, let me confirm whether the uniqueness is preserved across these cycles. Since the floor functions repeat every 60, if a number \( n \) in 1-60 is unique, then \( n + 60k \) for \( k = 0, 1, ..., 9 \) would also be unique in their respective blocks. So yes, this seems reasonable.

Therefore, first, I can focus on analyzing the range from 1 to 60, find how many numbers in this range have a unique \( n \) given the three floor values, and then just multiply by 10 to get the total up to 600.

Alright, so now, focusing on \( n \) from 1 to 60. Let's define:

For each \( n \), compute \( a = \left\lfloor \frac{n}{4} \right\rfloor \), \( b = \left\lfloor \frac{n}{5} \right\rfloor \), and \( c = \left\lfloor \frac{n}{6} \right\rfloor \). Then, check if there exists another number \( m \neq n \) such that \( \left\lfloor \frac{m}{4} \right\rfloor = a \), \( \left\lfloor \frac{m}{5} \right\rfloor = b \), and \( \left\lfloor \frac{m}{6} \right\rfloor = c \). If not, then \( n \) is uniquely determined.

Alternatively, for each \( n \), check if the intersection of the intervals \( [4a, 4(a+1)) \), \( [5b, 5(b+1)) \), and \( [6c, 6(c+1)) \) contains only \( n \).

But doing this manually for all 60 numbers would be tedious. Maybe I can find some patterns or constraints that can help narrow down the candidates.

Firstly, note that the intervals \( [4a, 4(a+1)) \), \( [5b, 5(b+1)) \), and \( [6c, 6(c+1)) \) overlap in specific ways. For their intersection to contain only one integer, the overlapping regions must be very tight.

Perhaps I can express \( n \) in terms of the lower bounds:

\( n \geq \max(4a, 5b, 6c) \)

And upper bounds:

\( n < \min(4(a+1), 5(b+1), 6(c+1)) \)

So, the interval is \( [\max(4a, 5b, 6c), \min(4(a+1), 5(b+1), 6(c+1))) \). For this interval to contain exactly one integer, the length of the interval must be less than 2. Because if the length is 2 or more, there could be two or more integers in the interval.

Wait, actually, no. The interval is half-open, so the maximum number of integers is the ceiling of the upper bound minus the floor of the lower bound. But since it's half-open, it's the floor of (upper bound - lower bound). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps instead of thinking about the intervals, I can model the equations based on congruences.

Given that \( n \) must satisfy:

\( 4a \leq n < 4(a+1) \)

\( 5b \leq n < 5(b+1) \)

\( 6c \leq n < 6(c+1) \)

Which can be rewritten as:

\( n \equiv r_4 \mod 4 \) where \( r_4 \in [0, 3] \)

\( n \equiv r_5 \mod 5 \) where \( r_5 \in [0, 4] \)

\( n \equiv r_6 \mod 6 \) where \( r_6 \in [0, 5] \)

But wait, actually, the remainders aren't arbitrary because \( a = \left\lfloor \frac{n}{4} \right\rfloor \), so \( n = 4a + r_4 \), with \( 0 \leq r_4 < 4 \). Similarly for the others.

However, since \( n \) is given, these congruences are directly related to the division algorithm.

But how does this help with uniqueness?

Alternatively, perhaps if the system of inequalities has a unique solution, then \( n \) is uniquely determined. So, maybe I can set up the inequalities:

\( 4a \leq n < 4(a+1) \)

\( 5b \leq n < 5(b+1) \)

\( 6c \leq n < 6(c+1) \)

These three inequalities must hold simultaneously, and the intersection must contain exactly one integer.

So, another way: For each \( n \), compute \( a, b, c \), and then check if any other \( n' \neq n \) satisfies the same \( a', b', c' \). If not, then \( n \) is unique.

But checking this for all \( n \) from 1 to 60 is manageable.

Alternatively, perhaps there is a smarter approach. Since the LCM is 60, maybe the uniqueness occurs when the intervals don't allow for another number in the same overlapping region.

Looking back, maybe the key is that the intervals for each modulus (4,5,6) must be such that the next interval starts after the previous one ends, thereby leaving no room for another integer.

But since 4, 5, 6 are co-prime in pairs except for 4 and 6 sharing a factor of 2, it's tricky.

Wait, perhaps considering that 4, 5, and 6 have different spacings, the overlaps may sometimes leave gaps or cover ranges where multiple \( n \)s can fit.

Wait, but maybe instead of looking at all possibilities, let's think about when the intervals for each modulus don't allow another number. That is, if the next multiple is beyond the current upper bound.

But I need to formalize this.

Suppose for a given \( a, b, c \), the intervals are:

\( [4a, 4(a+1)) \)

\( [5b, 5(b+1)) \)

\( [6c, 6(c+1)) \)

Their intersection is \( [\max(4a,5b,6c), \min(4(a+1),5(b+1),6(c+1))) \)

If the length of this interval is less than 1, then the intersection is empty, which cannot happen because \( n \) is in all intervals.

Wait, but the length needs to be at least 1, but the question is whether it contains only one integer.

So, for the intersection to contain only one integer, the interval must be such that it includes exactly one integer.

That is, the lower bound is less than or equal to some integer \( n \), and the upper bound is greater than \( n \) but less than or equal to \( n+1 \). So, mathematically,

\( \max(4a,5b,6c) \leq n < \min(4(a+1),5(b+1),6(c+1)) \)

and

\( \min(4(a+1),5(b+1),6(c+1)) - \max(4a,5b,6c) < 1 \)

Because if the difference is less than 1, the interval can contain at most one integer. But since \( n \) is an integer, the interval must include \( n \) but not \( n+1 \).

Thus, for uniqueness, the length of the intersection interval must be less than 1. So,

\( \min(4(a+1),5(b+1),6(c+1)) - \max(4a,5b,6c) < 1 \)

This inequality must hold for the intersection to contain only one integer \( n \).

Therefore, our condition becomes:

\( \min(4(a+1),5(b+1),6(c+1)) - \max(4a,5b,6c) < 1 \)

Which simplifies to:

\( \max(4a,5b,6c) < \min(4(a+1),5(b+1),6(c+1)) < \max(4a,5b,6c) + 1 \)

So, essentially, the lower bounds and upper bounds must be tightly packed around an integer.

Therefore, for each \( n \), if the above inequality holds, \( n \) is uniquely determined.

Hence, my task reduces to finding all \( n \leq 600 \) such that the above condition holds for their respective \( a, b, c \).

Now, how can I compute this efficiently?

Well, since \( n \) ranges up to 600, and the LCM is 60, as I thought earlier, perhaps analyzing one period (1-60) is sufficient, and then multiplying the count by 10.

So, let me focus on \( n \) from 1 to 60.

I can iterate through each \( n \) from 1 to 60, compute \( a = \lfloor n/4 \rfloor \), \( b = \lfloor n/5 \rfloor \), \( c = \lfloor n/6 \rfloor \), then compute:

Lower bound: \( L = \max(4a, 5b, 6c) \)

Upper bound: \( U = \min(4(a+1), 5(b+1), 6(c+1)) \)

Then, check if \( U - L < 1 \). If yes, then \( n \) is uniquely determined.

But even better, if \( L \) and \( U \) are such that \( L \leq n < U \) and \( U - L < 1 \), meaning the interval can only contain \( n \) itself.

So, for each \( n \), compute \( L \) and \( U \), check if \( U - L < 1 \). If so, count it.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find \( n \) such that:

\( 4a \leq n < 4(a+1) \)

\( 5b \leq n < 5(b+1) \)

\( 6c \leq n < 6(c+1) \)

And the minimal upper bound is just above the maximal lower bound.

So, another way is to ensure that:

The next multiple after \( n \) in each modulus doesn't interfere. Wait, that might not make much sense.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to note that for \( n \) to be uniquely determined, the following must hold:

\( n + 1 > 4(a+1) \), \( n + 1 > 5(b+1) \), and \( n + 1 > 6(c+1) \)

But that might not necessarily be true.

Wait, let me think differently. If \( n \) is uniquely determined, then \( n + 1 \) must exceed at least one of the upper bounds \( 4(a+1) \), \( 5(b+1) \), or \( 6(c+1) \). Otherwise, \( n + 1 \) would still satisfy the same floor conditions, making \( n \) non-unique.

Yes, that makes sense. So, for \( n \) to be uniquely determined, \( n + 1 \) must push beyond at least one of the intervals. That is:

Either \( n + 1 \geq 4(a+1) \), or \( n + 1 \geq 5(b+1) \), or \( n + 1 \geq 6(c+1) \).

But since \( n \) is the largest integer satisfying \( 4a \leq n < 4(a+1) \), etc., \( n + 1 \) would indeed cross into the next interval. However, for uniqueness, \( n + 1 \) must cross into a different interval for at least one modulus.

But perhaps I need to consider that if \( n + 1 \) crosses into a higher interval for more than one modulus, then \( n \) might not be unique because another number could also fit the same floor values.

Wait, maybe not necessarily. It depends on whether the crossing points coincide.

This is getting a bit convoluted. Maybe going back to the original plan of computing for each \( n \) from 1 to 60 whether the interval \( [\max(4a,5b,6c), \min(4(a+1),5(b+1),6(c+1))) \) contains exactly one integer.

Since 60 isn't too large, I can try to compute this manually or spot a pattern.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model this using modular arithmetic.

Each floor function imposes a constraint on \( n \):

1. \( n \equiv r_4 \mod 4 \), \( 0 \leq r_4 < 4 \)
2. \( n \equiv r_5 \mod 5 \), \( 0 \leq r_5 < 5 \)
3. \( n \equiv r_6 \mod 6 \), \( 0 \leq r_6 < 6 \)

These are congruences that \( n \) must satisfy. So, solving these congruences would give us solutions for \( n \). The number of solutions modulo the LCM (which is 60) would be 1 if the congruences are compatible and independent.

Wait, actually, if the system of congruences has a unique solution modulo 60, then each combination of \( r_4, r_5, r_6 \) that is consistent corresponds to a unique \( n \) modulo 60.

Therefore, if for a particular \( n \), the corresponding \( r_4, r_5, r_6 \) uniquely determine \( n \) modulo 60, then \( n \) is uniquely determined in each block of 60 numbers.

But this line of reasoning might not directly address the problem because the problem isn't about solving congruences, but rather about the intervals created by the floor functions.

But maybe the uniqueness of \( n \) is tied to the uniqueness of the solution to the system of congruences.

Wait, perhaps it's equivalent. If \( n \) is uniquely determined by \( r_4, r_5, r_6 \), then the system of congruences has only one solution in each modulus cycle. Hence, the number of unique \( n \) would correspond to the number of unique combinations of \( r_4, r_5, r_6 \) that result in a single \( n \) per 60-number block.

But I'm not sure if that's entirely accurate.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of unique \( n \) is equal to the number of residues modulo 60 that satisfy the uniqueness condition for their respective floor values.

But honestly, I'm getting confused here. Maybe it's better to go back and compute for each \( n \) from 1 to 60 whether the interval \( [\max(4a,5b,6c), \min(4(a+1),5(b+1),6(c+1))) \) contains only one integer.

To do this systematically, I can create a table for \( n \) from 1 to 60, compute \( a, b, c \), then compute \( L = \max(4a,5b,6c) \) and \( U = \min(4(a+1),5(b+1),6(c+1)) \), and check if \( U - L < 1 \).

But since this would take a lot of time, maybe I can look for patterns or identify ranges where \( n \) is uniquely determined.

Another thought: The intervals \( [4a, 4(a+1)) \), \( [5b, 5(b+1)) \), and \( [6c, 6(c+1)) \) must all overlap, and their overlap must be a single integer.

Therefore, for \( n \) to be unique, the overlap region must be exactly \( [n, n+1) \), meaning that \( \max(4a,5b,6c) = n \) and \( \min(4(a+1),5(b+1),6(c+1)) = n+1 \).

Therefore, the condition is:

\( \max(4a,5b,6c) = n \)

and

\( \min(4(a+1),5(b+1),6(c+1)) = n + 1 \)

Which implies:

1. \( n \) is the maximum of \( 4a, 5b, 6c \)
2. \( n + 1 \) is the minimum of \( 4(a+1), 5(b+1), 6(c+1) \)

So, both conditions must hold.

Therefore, for each \( n \), we can check if:

1. \( n \) is equal to \( 4a \), \( 5b \), or \( 6c \) whichever is the maximum among them.
2. \( n + 1 \) is equal to \( 4(a+1) \), \( 5(b+1) \), or \( 6(c+1) \) whichever is the minimum among them.

Therefore, we can rephrase the conditions as:

1. \( n = \max(4a, 5b, 6c) \)
2. \( n + 1 = \min(4(a+1), 5(b+1), 6(c+1)) \)

Given that \( a = \lfloor n / 4 \rfloor \), \( b = \lfloor n / 5 \rfloor \), \( c = \lfloor n / 6 \rfloor \), we can substitute these into the conditions.

But this seems circular because \( a, b, c \) depend on \( n \).

Wait, perhaps I can express \( a, b, c \) in terms of \( n \). Since \( a = \lfloor n / 4 \rfloor \), \( b = \lfloor n / 5 \rfloor \), \( c = \lfloor n / 6 \rfloor \), then:

- \( 4a \leq n < 4(a + 1) \)
- \( 5b \leq n < 5(b + 1) \)
- \( 6c \leq n < 6(c + 1) \)

Therefore, \( n \) is in the intersection of these three intervals.

So, the maximum of the left endpoints must be less than or equal to \( n \), and the minimum of the right endpoints must be greater than \( n \).

So, \( \max(4a,5b,6c) \leq n < \min(4(a+1),5(b+1),6(c+1)) \)

We want this interval to contain exactly one integer, which is \( n \).

Therefore, the length of the interval must be less than 1:

\( \min(4(a+1),5(b+1),6(c+1)) - \max(4a,5b,6c) < 1 \)

Which is the same as:

\( \min(4(a+1),5(b+1),6(c+1)) - \max(4a,5b,6c) < 1 \)

So, for each \( n \), compute \( a, b, c \), compute the max and min, subtract, and see if it's less than 1.

Alternatively, since \( \max(4a,5b,6c) \leq n < \min(4(a+1),5(b+1),6(c+1)) \), the length is \( \min(...) - \max(...) \), which must be less than 1.

So, again, the same condition.

Therefore, to find all such \( n \), I can iterate \( n \) from 1 to 60, compute \( a, b, c \), compute \( \max(4a,5b,6c) \) and \( \min(4(a+1),5(b+1),6(c+1)) \), check if the difference is less than 1.

But doing this manually is time-consuming. Maybe I can notice some properties or write out the expressions.

Alternatively, perhaps I can recognize that when the maximum of \( 4a,5b,6c \) is equal to the minimum of \( 4(a+1),5(b+1),6(c+1) \) minus 1, then the interval is exactly [n, n+1), meaning only \( n \) is inside.

So, \( \max(4a,5b,6c) = n \)

and

\( \min(4(a+1),5(b+1),6(c+1)) = n + 1 \)

Which implies:

1. \( n \) is equal to the maximum of the lower bounds.
2. \( n + 1 \) is equal to the minimum of the upper bounds.

Therefore, each of these conditions must hold. So, for each \( n \), check if \( n \) is equal to the maximum of \( 4a,5b,6c \) and \( n+1 \) is equal to the minimum of \( 4(a+1),5(b+1),6(c+1) \).

Alternatively, we can write:

1. \( n \geq 4a \), \( n \geq 5b \), \( n \geq 6c \)
2. \( n + 1 < 4(a + 1) \), \( n + 1 < 5(b + 1) \), \( n + 1 < 6(c + 1) \)

So, substituting \( a = \lfloor n / 4 \rfloor \), \( b = \lfloor n / 5 \rfloor \), \( c = \lfloor n / 6 \rfloor \), we get:

1. \( n \geq 4 \times \lfloor n / 4 \rfloor \)
   This is always true since \( n \geq 4 \times \lfloor n / 4 \rfloor \)
2. Similarly, \( n \geq 5 \times \lfloor n / 5 \rfloor \) and \( n \geq 6 \times \lfloor n / 6 \rfloor \) are always true.

Second set:

1. \( n + 1 < 4(\lfloor n / 4 \rfloor + 1) \)
   Simplifies to \( n + 1 < 4 \lfloor n / 4 \rfloor + 4 \)
   Which is \( n + 1 - 4 \lfloor n / 4 \rfloor < 4 \)
   Since \( n + 1 - 4 \lfloor n / 4 \rfloor \) is the remainder when \( n + 1 \) is divided by 4, which is between 1 and 4 (since \( n + 1 \) mod 4 is between 0 and 3, but since \( n + 1 \) is strictly less, it's between 1 and 4).
   
Similarly,
2. \( n + 1 < 5(\lfloor n / 5 \rfloor + 1) \) simplifies to \( n + 1 - 5 \lfloor n / 5 \rfloor < 5 \)
   Which is similar to the above, remainder when \( n + 1 \) is divided by 5, between 1 and 5.
3. \( n + 1 < 6(\lfloor n / 6 \rfloor + 1) \) simplifies to \( n + 1 - 6 \lfloor n / 6 \rfloor < 6 \)
   Again, the remainder when \( n + 1 \) is divided by 6, between 1 and 6.

Therefore, all three inequalities reduce to ensuring that the remainders of \( n + 1 \) modulo 4, 5, and 6 are less than 4, 5, and 6 respectively, which they always are. Wait, that can't be right because the remainders are bounded by the moduli, so they are always less than the moduli. Thus, the second set of conditions is automatically satisfied? That can't be, because otherwise, all \( n \) would satisfy the uniqueness condition, which contradicts intuition.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the inequalities.

Wait, when I write \( n + 1 < 4(\lfloor n / 4 \rfloor + 1) \), it's equivalent to \( n + 1 < 4a + 4 \), where \( a = \lfloor n / 4 \rfloor \). So, rearranged, \( n + 1 - 4a < 4 \). But \( n + 1 - 4a \) is equal to \( (n - 4a) + 1 \). Since \( n = 4a + r_4 \), where \( 0 \leq r_4 < 4 \), then \( n - 4a = r_4 \). So, \( n + 1 - 4a = r_4 + 1 \). Therefore, \( r_4 + 1 < 4 \) implies \( r_4 < 3 \). Since \( r_4 \) is an integer between 0 and 3, this implies \( r_4 \leq 2 \).

Similarly, for the fifth modulus:

\( n + 1 < 5(\lfloor n / 5 \rfloor + 1) \)

Which becomes \( n + 1 - 5b < 5 \). Since \( n = 5b + r_5 \), \( n + 1 - 5b = r_5 + 1 \). So, \( r_5 + 1 < 5 \implies r_5 < 4 \implies r_5 \leq 3 \).

For the sixth modulus:

\( n + 1 < 6(\lfloor n / 6 \rfloor + 1) \)

Which is \( n + 1 - 6c < 6 \). Since \( n = 6c + r_6 \), \( n + 1 - 6c = r_6 + 1 \). Thus, \( r_6 + 1 < 6 \implies r_6 < 5 \implies r_6 \leq 4 \).

Therefore, putting it all together, for \( n \) to satisfy both conditions, the remainders must satisfy:

- \( r_4 \leq 2 \)
- \( r_5 \leq 3 \)
- \( r_6 \leq 4 \)

Where \( r_4 = n \mod 4 \), \( r_5 = n \mod 5 \), \( r_6 = n \mod 6 \).

Therefore, \( n \) must satisfy:

- \( n \mod 4 \leq 2 \)
- \( n \mod 5 \leq 3 \)
- \( n \mod 6 \leq 4 \)

This is a crucial realization! So, the condition for \( n \) being uniquely determined is equivalent to \( n \) modulo 4, 5, and 6 being at most 2, 3, and 4 respectively.

Therefore, instead of dealing with the intervals, I can now frame the problem as counting the numbers \( n \leq 600 \) such that:

1. \( n \mod 4 \leq 2 \)
2. \( n \mod 5 \leq 3 \)
3. \( n \mod 6 \leq 4 \)

So, now the problem reduces to solving a system of congruences with these remainder constraints.

But how do I count the number of \( n \leq 600 \) satisfying these conditions?

This seems like a classic inclusion-exclusion problem, but with multiple constraints.

Alternatively, since the moduli 4, 5, and 6 are involved, and 6 is a multiple of 2 and 3, perhaps the Chinese Remainder Theorem can be applied, but since the constraints are on the remainders, not specific congruences, it's a bit trickier.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as a problem of counting numbers not congruent to 3 mod 4, 4 mod 5, or 5 mod 6. Wait, not exactly, because it's about the remainders being less than certain numbers.

Wait, let me rephrase:

Condition 1: \( n \mod 4 \leq 2 \) means \( n \) is not congruent to 3 mod 4.

Condition 2: \( n \mod 5 \leq 3 \) means \( n \) is not congruent to 4 mod 5.

Condition 3: \( n \mod 6 \leq 4 \) means \( n \) is not congruent to 5 mod 6.

So, effectively, the forbidden residues are:

- Modulo 4: 3
- Modulo 5: 4
- Modulo 6: 5

Therefore, \( n \) must not be congruent to 3 mod 4, 4 mod 5, or 5 mod 6.

Hence, the problem reduces to counting numbers \( n \leq 600 \) that are not congruent to 3 mod 4, 4 mod 5, or 5 mod 6.

This is a standard inclusion-exclusion problem where we need to exclude numbers falling into any of these residue classes.

So, let's denote:

- A: Numbers ≡3 mod4
- B: Numbers ≡4 mod5
- C: Numbers ≡5 mod6

We need to compute the total numbers ≤600 not in A ∪ B ∪ C.

Total numbers: 600

Numbers in A: floor((600 - 3)/4) + 1 = ?

Wait, formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic progression: If first term is a, last term l, common difference d, then number of terms is ((l - a)/d) + 1.

But for A: numbers ≡3 mod4 starting from 3,7,11,..., up to ≤600.

Compute the number of such terms:

First term: 3

Last term: The largest number ≤600 and ≡3 mod4. 600 ÷4=150, so 4×150=600, so 600-1=599≡3 mod4? 599 ÷4=149.75, 4×149=596, 596+3=599. Yes, 599 is the last term.

Number of terms: ((599 - 3)/4)+1 = (596 /4)+1=149 +1=150

Similarly, for B: numbers ≡4 mod5.

First term:4

Last term: The largest number ≤600 and ≡4 mod5. 600 ÷5=120, so 5×119=595, 595+4=599. So last term is 599.

Number of terms: ((599 -4)/5)+1=(595 /5)+1=119 +1=120

For C: numbers ≡5 mod6.

First term:5

Last term: Largest number ≤600 and ≡5 mod6. 600 ÷6=100, so 6×99=594, 594+5=599.

Number of terms: ((599 -5)/6)+1=(594 /6)+1=99 +1=100

Now, compute |A| =150, |B|=120, |C|=100.

Next, compute pairwise intersections:

|A ∩ B|: Numbers ≡3 mod4 and ≡4 mod5.

We need to solve the system:

x ≡3 mod4

x ≡4 mod5

Using Chinese Remainder Theorem.

Let’s find x ≡? mod20 (since 4 and5 are coprime).

Express x as 4k +3. Plug into second equation:

4k +3 ≡4 mod5 => 4k ≡1 mod5 => Multiply both sides by inverse of4 mod5, which is 4, since 4×4=16≡1 mod5.

Thus, k≡4×1=4 mod5.

So k=5m +4.

Thus, x=4*(5m +4)+3=20m +16 +3=20m +19.

Thus, x≡19 mod20.

So, the numbers in A ∩ B are those ≡19 mod20.

First term:19

Last term:≤600.

Compute last term: 600 ÷20=30, so 20×29=580, 580+19=599.

Number of terms: ((599 -19)/20)+1=(580 /20)+1=29 +1=30.

Similarly, |A ∩ C|: Numbers ≡3 mod4 and ≡5 mod6.

Solve:

x ≡3 mod4

x ≡5 mod6

Find x ≡? mod12 (since lcm(4,6)=12)

Express x=4k +3.

Plug into second equation:

4k +3 ≡5 mod6 => 4k ≡2 mod6 => 2k ≡1 mod3.

Multiply both sides by inverse of2 mod3, which is2, since2×2=4≡1 mod3.

Thus, k≡2×1=2 mod3.

So k=3m +2.

Thus, x=4*(3m +2)+3=12m +8 +3=12m +11.

Thus, x≡11 mod12.

Numbers in A ∩ C are ≡11 mod12.

First term:11

Last term:≤600. 600 ÷12=50, so 12×49=588, 588+11=599.

Number of terms: ((599 -11)/12)+1=(588 /12)+1=49 +1=50.

Similarly, |B ∩ C|: Numbers ≡4 mod5 and ≡5 mod6.

Solve:

x≡4 mod5

x≡5 mod6

Find x≡? mod30 (lcm(5,6)=30)

Express x=5k +4.

Plug into second equation:

5k +4 ≡5 mod6 =>5k ≡1 mod6 =>5k≡1 mod6 =>Multiply both sides by inverse of5 mod6, which is5, since5×5=25≡1 mod6.

Thus, k≡5×1=5 mod6.

So k=6m +5.

Thus, x=5*(6m +5)+4=30m +25 +4=30m +29.

Thus, x≡29 mod30.

Numbers in B ∩ C are ≡29 mod30.

First term:29

Last term:≤600. 600 ÷30=20, so 30×19=570, 570+29=599.

Number of terms: ((599 -29)/30)+1=(570 /30)+1=19 +1=20.

Finally, compute |A ∩ B ∩ C|: Numbers ≡3 mod4, ≡4 mod5, ≡5 mod6.

We need to solve the system:

x ≡3 mod4

x ≡4 mod5

x ≡5 mod6

From earlier, we know that x ≡19 mod20 from A ∩ B.

Now, we can plug x=20m +19 into x≡5 mod6.

20m +19 ≡5 mod6 =>20m ≡-14 mod6 =>20m ≡4 mod6.

But 20 mod6=2, so 2m ≡4 mod6 => Divide both sides by 2: m ≡2 mod3.

Thus, m=3k +2.

Thus, x=20*(3k +2)+19=60k +40 +19=60k +59.

Therefore, x≡59 mod60.

Check: 59 mod4=3, 59 mod5=4, 59 mod6=5. Correct.

So, the numbers in A ∩ B ∩ C are ≡59 mod60.

First term:59

Last term:≤600. 600 ÷60=10, so 60×9=540, 540+59=599.

Number of terms: ((599 -59)/60)+1=(540 /60)+1=9 +1=10.

Now, applying inclusion-exclusion:

|A ∪ B ∪ C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A ∩ B| - |A ∩ C| - |B ∩ C| + |A ∩ B ∩ C|

Plugging in the numbers:

= 150 + 120 + 100 - 30 - 50 - 20 + 10

Compute step by step:

Start with 150 +120=270; 270 +100=370

Subtract 30: 370 -30=340; 340 -50=290; 290 -20=270

Add 10: 270 +10=280

Therefore, |A ∪ B ∪ C| =280

Hence, the numbers not in A ∪ B ∪ C are Total - |A ∪ B ∪ C| =600 -280=320.

Therefore, in each 60-number block, there are 320 numbers that satisfy all three conditions.

Hence, for n ≤600, the number of such n is 320.

But wait, hold on. Earlier, I concluded that in each 60-number block, there are 320 numbers that are not ≡3 mod4, ≡4 mod5, or ≡5 mod6. Thus, these 320 numbers are uniquely determined because they satisfy \( r_4 \leq 2 \), \( r_5 \leq 3 \), and \( r_6 \leq 4 \).

Therefore, since each 60-number block contributes 320 such numbers, and since 600 is exactly 10 blocks (60×10=600), the total number of such n ≤600 is 320×10=3200.

But wait, hold on. Wait, 600 divided by 60 is 10, so yes, 10 blocks. Each block has 320 numbers. So 10×320=3200.

But wait, hold on. Is this correct?

Wait, let me verify. In each 60-number block, there are 320 numbers that are not ≡3 mod4, ≡4 mod5, or ≡5 mod6. So, each block has 320 such numbers.

But does this mean that each of these 320 numbers maps to a unique \( n \) in the block? Or is it that within each block, 320 numbers are uniquely determined.

But n is counted across all blocks, so if each block contributes 320, then the total is 320×10=3200.

But let me verify with small n.

Wait, for example, in the first block, n=1 to 60, there are 320 numbers that are not ≡3 mod4, ≡4 mod5, or ≡5 mod6. Therefore, each of these 320 numbers in 1-60 is uniquely determined, so each corresponds to a unique \( n \).

Similarly, in the next block, 61-120, same thing, another 320 numbers.

Thus, over 10 blocks, 3200 numbers.

But wait, hang on a moment. Let me test for n=1.

n=1: r4=1, r5=1, r6=1. So, r4=1 <=2, r5=1<=3, r6=1<=4. Therefore, it satisfies all conditions, so it's counted in 320.

Similarly, n=2: same logic.

n=3: r4=3, which is >2, so excluded.

n=4: r5=4>3, excluded.

n=5: r6=5>4, excluded.

n=6: r4=6 mod4=2<=2, r5=6 mod5=1<=3, r6=6 mod6=0<=4. So, included.

Wait, n=6 is included, but n=6: 6 mod4=2, 6 mod5=1, 6 mod6=0.

Yes, all remainders <=2,3,4 respectively.

So, in the first 6 numbers, 1,2,6 are included, while 3,4,5 are excluded. So, 3 included, 3 excluded.

But according to our earlier calculation, in 60 numbers, 320 are included. So, 320/60≈5.333 per block. That seems plausible.

But let me compute for n=1 to 60, how many satisfy all three conditions.

To verify, let me compute |A|, |B|, |C| in 1-60:

|A|=15, |B|=12, |C|=10.

|A ∩ B|=3, |A ∩ C|=5, |B ∩ C|=2.

|A ∩ B ∩ C|=1.

So, |A ∪ B ∪ C|=15 +12 +10 -3 -5 -2 +1=15+12=27+10=37-3=34-5=29-2=27+1=28.

Hence, numbers not in A ∪ B ∪ C=60 -28=32.

But wait, according to our earlier calculation, in 60 numbers, the count was 320, but 32 is for 60 numbers, which is 32. Hmm, discrepancy here.

Wait, in the general case, we had |A|, |B|, |C| as 150, 120, 100 for numbers up to 600. But in 1-60, |A|=15, |B|=12, |C|=10. So, generalized, for N=60k, |A|=15k, |B|=12k, |C|=10k, |A ∩ B|=3k, |A ∩ C|=5k, |B ∩ C|=2k, |A ∩ B ∩ C|=k.

Therefore, |A ∪ B ∪ C|=15k +12k +10k -3k -5k -2k +k= (15+12+10 -3-5-2 +1)k=28k.

Thus, numbers not in A ∪ B ∪ C=60k -28k=32k.

Therefore, in 60 numbers, 32 are not in A ∪ B ∪ C, which matches the manual count in 1-60: 32.

Hence, for 600=60×10, numbers not in A ∪ B ∪ C=32×10=320.

Therefore, the initial conclusion was correct.

Thus, the number of positive integers \( n \leq600 \) whose value can be uniquely determined is 320.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{320}
</think>

To determine the number of positive integers \( n \leq 600 \) whose value can be uniquely determined when the values of \( \left\lfloor \frac{n}{4} \right\rfloor \), \( \left\lfloor \frac{n}{5} \right\rfloor \), and \( \left\lfloor \frac{n}{6} \right\rfloor \) are given, we need to analyze the intervals in which \( n \) must lie.

For each \( n \), we compute:
- \( a = \left\lfloor \frac{n}{4} \right\rfloor \)
- \( b = \left\lfloor \frac{n}{5} \right\rfloor \)
- \( c = \left\lfloor \frac{n}{6} \right\rfloor \)

The intervals for \( n \) are:
- \( [4a, 4(a+1)) \)
- \( [5b, 5(b+1)) \)
- \( [6c, 6(c+1)) \)

The intersection of these intervals must contain exactly one integer \( n \). This happens when the remainders \( n \mod 4 \), \( n \mod 5 \), and \( n \mod 6 \) are constrained appropriately.

We found that \( n \) must satisfy:
- \( n \mod 4 \leq 2 \)
- \( n \mod 5 \leq 3 \)
- \( n \mod 6 \leq 4 \)

These conditions translate to avoiding numbers that are congruent to 3 mod 4, 4 mod 5, or 5 mod 6. Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, we calculated the number of such \( n \) in each block of 60 numbers.

In each 60-number block, there are 32 numbers that satisfy all three conditions. Extending this to 600 numbers (10 blocks of 60), we find the total number of such \( n \) is \( 32 \times 10 = 320 \).

Thus, the number of positive integers \( n \leq 600 \) whose value can be uniquely determined is:

\[
\boxed{320}
