 The problem: 
Let $x,$ $y,$ and $z$ be positive real numbers satisfying the system of equations:
\begin{align*} \sqrt{2x-xy} + \sqrt{2y-xy} &= 1 \\ \sqrt{2y-yz} + \sqrt{2z-yz} &= \sqrt2 \\ \sqrt{2z-zx} + \sqrt{2x-zx} &= \sqrt3. \end{align*} 
Then $\left[ (1-x)(1-y)(1-z) \right]^2$ can be written as $\frac{m}{n},$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n.$


To solve the given system of equations, we start by analyzing each equation individually. Let's begin with the first equation:

\[
\sqrt{2x - xy} + \sqrt{2y - xy} = 1
\]

We can rewrite this equation as:

\[
\sqrt{x(2 - y)} + \sqrt{y(2 - x)} = 1
\]

Next, consider the second equation:

\[
\sqrt{2y - yz} + \sqrt{2z - yz} = \sqrt{2}
\]

Rewriting it, we get:

\[
\sqrt{y(2 - z)} + \sqrt{z(2 - y)} = \sqrt{2}
\]

Finally, the third equation is:

\[
\sqrt{2z - zx} + \sqrt{2x - zx} = \sqrt{3}
\]

Rewriting it, we have:

\[
\sqrt{z(2 - x)} + \sqrt{x(2 - z)} = \sqrt{3}
\]

To find a solution, let's assume \(x = y = z\). Substituting \(x = y = z\) into the first equation, we get:

\[
\sqrt{x(2 - x)} + \sqrt{x(2 - x)} = 1
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
2\sqrt{x(2 - x)} = 1 \implies \sqrt{x(2 - x)} = \frac{1}{2} \implies x(2 - x) = \frac{1}{4}
\]

Solving the quadratic equation \(4x^2 - 8x + 1 = 0\), we use the quadratic formula \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\):

\[
x = \frac{8 \pm \sqrt{64 - 16}}{8} = \frac{8 \pm \sqrt{48}}{8} = \frac{8 \pm 4\sqrt{3}}{8} = 1 \pm \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]

Since \(x\) is a positive real number, we take the smaller root:

\[
x = 1 - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]

Now, substituting \(x = y = z = 1 - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\) into the expression \((1-x)(1-y)(1-z)\), we get:

\[
1 - x = 1 - \left(1 - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]

Thus,

\[
(1-x)(1-y)(1-z) = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^3 = \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{8}
\]

Squaring this result, we get:

\[
\left[(1-x)(1-y)(1-z)\right]^2 = \left(\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{27}{64}
\]

Therefore, \(m = 27\) and \(n = 64\), and the sum \(m + n\) is:

\[
\boxed{91}
\]
