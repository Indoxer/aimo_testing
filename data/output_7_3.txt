 The problem: 
Find the three-digit positive integer $\underline{a}\,\underline{b}\,\underline{c}$ whose representation in base nine is $\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\,\underline{a}_{\,\text{nine}},$ where $a,$ $b,$ and $c$ are (not necessarily distinct) digits.


To solve the problem, we need to find a three-digit number \(\underline{a}\,\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\) such that its representation in base nine is \(\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\,\underline{a}_{\,\text{nine}}\). This means that the number \(\underline{a}\,\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\) in decimal is equal to the number \(\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\,\underline{a}_{\,\text{nine}}\) in decimal.

First, let's express the number \(\underline{a}\,\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\) in decimal:
\[100a + 10b + c.\]

Next, let's express the number \(\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\,\underline{a}_{\,\text{nine}}\) in decimal. Since it is in base nine, we have:
\[b \cdot 9^2 + c \cdot 9^1 + a = 81b + 9c + a.\]

We set these two expressions equal to each other:
\[100a + 10b + c = 81b + 9c + a.\]

Rearranging terms, we get:
\[100a + 10b + c - a - 81b - 9c = 0,\]
\[99a - 71b - 8c = 0.\]

This simplifies to:
\[99a = 71b + 8c.\]

Since \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are digits (i.e., integers between 0 and 9), we need to find values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) that satisfy this equation. Let's test possible values for \(a\).

If \(a = 8\):
\[99 \cdot 8 = 71b + 8c,\]
\[792 = 71b + 8c.\]

We need to find integers \(b\) and \(c\) such that \(71b + 8c = 792\). Let's test possible values for \(b\).

If \(b = 8\):
\[71 \cdot 8 + 8c = 792,\]
\[568 + 8c = 792,\]
\[8c = 224,\]
\[c = 28.\]

Since \(c = 28\) is not a digit (it is greater than 9), \(b = 8\) is not a solution. Let's try another value for \(b\).

If \(b = 6\):
\[71 \cdot 6 + 8c = 792,\]
\[426 + 8c = 792,\]
\[8c = 366,\]
\[c = 45.75.\]

Since \(c = 45.75\) is not an integer, \(b = 6\) is not a solution. Let's try another value for \(b\).

If \(b = 4\):
\[71 \cdot 4 + 8c = 792,\]
\[284 + 8c = 792,\]
\[8c = 508,\]
\[c = 63.5.\]

Since \(c = 63.5\) is not an integer, \(b = 4\) is not a solution. Let's try another value for \(b\).

If \(b = 2\):
\[71 \cdot 2 + 8c = 792,\]
\[142 + 8c = 792,\]
\[8c = 650,\]
\[c = 81.25.\]

Since \(c = 81.25\) is not an integer, \(b = 2\) is not a solution. Let's try another value for \(b\).

If \(b = 0\):
\[71 \cdot 0 + 8c = 792,\]
\[8c = 792,\]
\[c = 99.\]

Since \(c = 99\) is not a digit, \(b = 0\) is not a solution. Let's try another value for \(a\).

If \(a = 1\):
\[99 \cdot 1 = 71b + 8c,\]
\[99 = 71b + 8c.\]

Let's test possible values for \(b\).

If \(b = 1\):
\[71 \cdot 1 + 8c = 99,\]
\[71 + 8c = 99,\]
\[8c = 28,\]
\[c = 3.\]

So, \(a = 1\), \(b = 1\), and \(c = 3\) is a solution. Therefore, the three-digit number is:
\[\boxed{113}.\]
