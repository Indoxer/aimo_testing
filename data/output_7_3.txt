 The problem: 
Find the three-digit positive integer $\underline{a}\,\underline{b}\,\underline{c}$ whose representation in base nine is $\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\,\underline{a}_{\,\text{nine}},$ where $a,$ $b,$ and $c$ are (not necessarily distinct) digits.


To solve the problem, we need to find a three-digit number \(\underline{a}\,\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\) such that its representation in base nine is \(\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\,\underline{a}_{\,\text{nine}}\). This means that the number \(100a + 10b + c\) in decimal is equal to the number \(81b + 9c + a\) in base nine.

We start by setting up the equation:
\[100a + 10b + c = 81b + 9c + a.\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[99a - 71b - 8c = 0.\]
This can be rewritten as:
\[99a = 71b + 8c.\]
Since \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are digits (i.e., integers between 0 and 9), we need to find values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) that satisfy this equation. Let's test possible values for \(a\) starting from the largest possible digit (since 99 is the largest coefficient).

If \(a = 8\):
\[99 \cdot 8 = 792.\]
So we need:
\[71b + 8c = 792.\]
Testing \(b = 8\):
\[71 \cdot 8 + 8c = 792 \implies 568 + 8c = 792 \implies 8c = 224 \implies c = 28.\]
Since \(c\) must be a digit (0-9), \(c = 28\) is not valid.

Next, let's try \(a = 7\):
\[99 \cdot 7 = 693.\]
So we need:
\[71b + 8c = 693.\]
Testing \(b = 8\):
\[71 \cdot 8 + 8c = 693 \implies 568 + 8c = 693 \implies 8c = 125 \implies c = 15.625.\]
Since \(c\) must be a digit (0-9), \(c = 15.625\) is not valid.

Next, let's try \(a = 6\):
\[99 \cdot 6 = 594.\]
So we need:
\[71b + 8c = 594.\]
Testing \(b = 8\):
\[71 \cdot 8 + 8c = 594 \implies 568 + 8c = 594 \implies 8c = 26 \implies c = 3.25.\]
Since \(c\) must be a digit (0-9), \(c = 3.25\) is not valid.

Next, let's try \(a = 5\):
\[99 \cdot 5 = 495.\]
So we need:
\[71b + 8c = 495.\]
Testing \(b = 6\):
\[71 \cdot 6 + 8c = 495 \implies 426 + 8c = 495 \implies 8c = 69 \implies c = 8.625.\]
Since \(c\) must be a digit (0-9), \(c = 8.625\) is not valid.

Next, let's try \(a = 4\):
\[99 \cdot 4 = 396.\]
So we need:
\[71b + 8c = 396.\]
Testing \(b = 5\):
\[71 \cdot 5 + 8c = 396 \implies 355 + 8c = 396 \implies 8c = 41 \implies c = 5.125.\]
Since \(c\) must be a digit (0-9), \(c = 5.125\) is not valid.

Next, let's try \(a = 3\):
\[99 \cdot 3 = 297.\]
So we need:
\[71b + 8c = 297.\]
Testing \(b = 4\):
\[71 \cdot 4 + 8c = 297 \implies 284 + 8c = 297 \implies 8c = 13 \implies c = 1.625.\]
Since \(c\) must be a digit (0-9), \(c = 1.625\) is not valid.

Next, let's try \(a = 2\):
\[99 \cdot 2 = 198.\]
So we need:
\[71b + 8c = 198.\]
Testing \(b = 2\):
\[71 \cdot 2 + 8c = 198 \implies 142 + 8c = 198 \implies 8c = 56 \implies c = 7.\]
Since \(c = 7\) is a digit (0-9), this is a valid solution. Therefore, the number is \(227\).

Thus, the three-digit number is \(\boxed{227}\).
