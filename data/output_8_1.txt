 The problem: 
In isosceles trapezoid $ABCD$, parallel bases $\overline{AB}$ and $\overline{CD}$ have lengths $500$ and $650$, respectively, and $AD=BC=333$. The angle bisectors of $\angle{A}$ and $\angle{D}$ meet at $P$, and the angle bisectors of $\angle{B}$ and $\angle{C}$ meet at $Q$. Find $PQ$.


To solve for the length \(PQ\) in the given isosceles trapezoid \(ABCD\), we start by understanding the geometric properties and relationships within the trapezoid.

1. **Identify the coordinates and properties:**
   - Let \(A = (0, 0)\), \(B = (500, 0)\), \(D = (x, h)\), and \(C = (x+650, h)\).
   - Since \(AD = BC = 333\) and \(ABCD\) is an isosceles trapezoid, the height \(h\) can be found using the Pythagorean theorem in the right triangles formed by dropping perpendiculars from \(D\) and \(C\) to \(AB\).

2. **Calculate the height \(h\):**
   - The horizontal distance between the feet of the perpendiculars from \(D\) and \(C\) to \(AB\) is \(650 - 500 = 150\). Therefore, in the right triangle formed by \(D\), the foot of the perpendicular, and the point on \(AB\), the legs are \(75\) (half of 150) and \(h\), with the hypotenuse being 333.
   - Using the Pythagorean theorem:
     \[
     h = \sqrt{333^2 - 75^2} = \sqrt{110889 - 5625} = \sqrt{105264} = 324
     \]
   - So, the coordinates of \(D\) and \(C\) are \(D = (150, 324)\) and \(C = (800, 324)\).

3. **Find the intersection points \(P\) and \(Q\):**
   - The angle bisectors of \(\angle A\) and \(\angle D\) meet at \(P\), and the angle bisectors of \(\angle B\) and \(\angle C\) meet at \(Q\). In an isosceles trapezoid, the angle bisectors of the non-parallel sides intersect on the line segment joining the midpoints of the parallel sides.
   - The midpoints of \(AB\) and \(CD\) are \((250, 0)\) and \((475, 324)\), respectively. The line segment joining these midpoints is the line \(y = \frac{324}{225}(x - 250)\).
   - The intersection of this line with the line \(y = 324\) (the height of the trapezoid) is at \(x = 475\). Therefore, \(PQ\) is the vertical distance between the points where the angle bisectors meet the height, which is simply the height of the trapezoid.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The length \(PQ\) is the same as the height of the trapezoid, which is 324.

Thus, the length \(PQ\) is \(\boxed{324}\).
