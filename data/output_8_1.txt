 The problem: 
In isosceles trapezoid $ABCD$, parallel bases $\overline{AB}$ and $\overline{CD}$ have lengths $500$ and $650$, respectively, and $AD=BC=333$. The angle bisectors of $\angle{A}$ and $\angle{D}$ meet at $P$, and the angle bisectors of $\angle{B}$ and $\angle{C}$ meet at $Q$. Find $PQ$.


To solve for the length \(PQ\) in the given isosceles trapezoid \(ABCD\), we start by understanding the properties and dimensions of the trapezoid. The bases are \(AB = 500\) and \(CD = 650\), and the non-parallel sides are \(AD = BC = 333\).

First, we drop perpendiculars from points \(A\) and \(B\) to line \(CD\), meeting \(CD\) at points \(E\) and \(F\) respectively. This creates two right triangles \(ADE\) and \(BCF\) with \(DE = CF\) and \(EF = AB = 500\). Since \(CD = DE + EF + CF = DE + 500 + DE = 2DE + 500\), we have:
\[2DE + 500 = 650 \implies 2DE = 150 \implies DE = 75.\]
Thus, \(DE = CF = 75\).

Next, we use the Pythagorean theorem in triangle \(ADE\) to find the height \(h\) of the trapezoid:
\[AD^2 = DE^2 + h^2 \implies 333^2 = 75^2 + h^2 \implies 110889 = 5625 + h^2 \implies h^2 = 105264 \implies h = \sqrt{105264} = 324.\]

Now, we need to find the coordinates of points \(P\) and \(Q\). Since \(P\) is the intersection of the angle bisectors of \(\angle A\) and \(\angle D\), and \(Q\) is the intersection of the angle bisectors of \(\angle B\) and \(\angle C\), both \(P\) and \(Q\) lie on the line that is the perpendicular bisector of the segment joining the midpoints of \(AB\) and \(CD\). This line is parallel to the bases and is located at a distance equal to the height of the trapezoid divided by 2 from each base.

The distance between \(P\) and \(Q\) is the same as the distance between the midpoints of \(AB\) and \(CD\) because \(P\) and \(Q\) are on the same horizontal line (parallel to the bases). The distance between the midpoints of \(AB\) and \(CD\) is half the difference of the lengths of the bases:
\[\frac{CD - AB}{2} = \frac{650 - 500}{2} = 75.\]
Thus, the length \(PQ\) is:
\[\boxed{324}.\]
