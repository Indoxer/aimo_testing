 The problem: 
In isosceles trapezoid $ABCD$, parallel bases $\overline{AB}$ and $\overline{CD}$ have lengths $500$ and $650$, respectively, and $AD=BC=333$. The angle bisectors of $\angle{A}$ and $\angle{D}$ meet at $P$, and the angle bisectors of $\angle{B}$ and $\angle{C}$ meet at $Q$. Find $PQ$.


To solve for the length \(PQ\) in the given isosceles trapezoid \(ABCD\), we start by analyzing the geometry of the trapezoid and the properties of the angle bisectors.

First, let's place the trapezoid in a coordinate system. Assume \(A = (0, 0)\), \(B = (500, 0)\), \(D = (x, h)\), and \(C = (x+650, h)\). Since \(AD = BC = 333\), we can use the distance formula to find \(x\) and \(h\).

The distance \(AD\) is given by:
\[
AD = \sqrt{x^2 + h^2} = 333
\]
The distance \(BC\) is given by:
\[
BC = \sqrt{(x+650-500)^2 + h^2} = \sqrt{(x+150)^2 + h^2} = 333
\]

Since \(AD = BC\), we have:
\[
x^2 + h^2 = (x+150)^2 + h^2
\]
Simplifying this equation, we get:
\[
x^2 = x^2 + 300x + 22500 \implies 300x = -22500 \implies x = -75
\]
So, \(D = (-75, h)\) and \(C = (575, h)\). Substituting \(x = -75\) back into the equation for \(AD\):
\[
(-75)^2 + h^2 = 333^2 \implies 5625 + h^2 = 110889 \implies h^2 = 105264 \implies h = \sqrt{105264} = 324
\]

Now, we need to find the coordinates of points \(P\) and \(Q\). The angle bisectors of \(\angle A\) and \(\angle D\) meet at point \(P\), and the angle bisectors of \(\angle B\) and \(\angle C\) meet at point \(Q\). In an isosceles trapezoid, the angle bisectors of the non-parallel sides intersect on the line segment joining the midpoints of the bases.

The midpoints of \(AB\) and \(CD\) are \((250, 0)\) and \((612.5, 0)\) respectively. The line segment joining these midpoints is horizontal and has a length of \(612.5 - 250 = 362.5\). Therefore, the distance \(PQ\) is half of this length because \(P\) and \(Q\) are the intersection points of the angle bisectors, which lie on the line segment joining the midpoints.

Thus, the length \(PQ\) is:
\[
PQ = \frac{362.5}{2} = 181.25
\]

So, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{333}
\]
