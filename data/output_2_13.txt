 The problem: 
Let $ABCD$ be a parallelogram with $\angle BAD < 90^\circ.$ A circle tangent to sides $\overline{DA},$ $\overline{AB},$ and $\overline{BC}$ intersects diagonal $\overline{AC}$ at points $P$ and $Q$ with $AP < AQ,$ as shown. Suppose that $AP=3,$ $PQ=9,$ and $QC=16.$ Then the area of $ABCD$ can be expressed in the form $m\sqrt{n},$ where $m$ and $n$ are positive integers, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n.$


To solve for the area of parallelogram \(ABCD\), we start by analyzing the given information about the circle and the parallelogram. The circle is tangent to sides \(DA\), \(AB\), and \(BC\) of the parallelogram, and it intersects diagonal \(AC\) at points \(P\) and \(Q\) such that \(AP = 3\), \(PQ = 9\), and \(QC = 16\). Therefore, the length of diagonal \(AC\) is \(AP + PQ + QC = 3 + 9 + 16 = 28\).

Since the circle is tangent to \(DA\), \(AB\), and \(BC\), it is an excircle of the triangle formed by extending the sides of the parallelogram. The key property here is that the tangents from a point to a circle are equal. Let's denote the points of tangency on \(DA\), \(AB\), and \(BC\) as \(X\), \(Y\), and \(Z\) respectively. Since \(DA\) and \(BC\) are parallel and equal in length, and the circle is tangent to these sides, the tangents from \(A\) and \(C\) to the points of tangency are equal.

The lengths of the tangents from \(A\) and \(C\) to the points of tangency are equal, so if we let the tangents from \(A\) to the points of tangency on \(DA\) and \(AB\) be \(s\) and \(t\) respectively, then the tangents from \(C\) to the points of tangency on \(BC\) and \(CD\) will also be \(s\) and \(t\). This gives us the equation for the lengths of the sides of the parallelogram:
\[AB = s + t,\]
\[BC = t + s = AB.\]

Given the lengths of the segments on the diagonal \(AC\), we can use the fact that the tangents from a point to a circle are equal to find the lengths of the sides of the parallelogram. The length of \(AC\) is the sum of the tangents from \(A\) and \(C\) to the points of tangency, which are \(s + t\). Since \(AP = 3\) and \(PQ = 9\), the length of \(AQ\) is \(AP + PQ = 3 + 9 = 12\). Similarly, since \(QC = 16\), the length of \(AC\) is \(AQ + QC = 12 + 16 = 28\).

Now, we need to find the height of the parallelogram. The height can be found using the properties of the tangents and the Pythagorean theorem. The height \(h\) of the parallelogram can be found by considering the right triangle formed by the height, half the base, and the slant height of the parallelogram. The slant height is the radius of the circle plus the distance from the center of the circle to the side of the parallelogram, which is the same as the height of the parallelogram minus the radius of the circle.

Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the height \(h\) of the parallelogram. The height \(h\) is given by:
\[h = \sqrt{AC^2 - (s + t)^2} = \sqrt{28^2 - 14^2} = \sqrt{784 - 196} = \sqrt{588} = 14\sqrt{3}.\]

The area of the parallelogram is given by the base times the height. The base of the parallelogram is \(AB = s + t = 14\), and the height is \(14\sqrt{3}\). Therefore, the area of the parallelogram is:
\[AB \times h = 14 \times 14\sqrt{3} = 196\sqrt{3}.\]

Thus, the area of the parallelogram can be expressed in the form \(m\sqrt{n}\) where \(m = 196\) and \(n = 3\). Therefore, \(m + n = 196 + 3 = 199\).

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{199}
\]
