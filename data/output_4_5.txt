 The problem: 
Let $S$ be the set of all rational numbers that can be expressed as a repeating decimal in the form $0.\overline{abcd},$ where at least one of the digits $a,$ $b,$ $c,$ or $d$ is nonzero. Let $N$ be the number of distinct numerators obtained when numbers in $S$ are written as fractions in lowest terms. For example, both $4$ and $410$ are counted among the distinct numerators for numbers in $S$ because $0.\overline{3636} = \frac{4}{11}$ and $0.\overline{1230} = \frac{410}{3333}.$ Find the remainder when $N$ is divided by $1000.$


To solve the problem, we first need to understand the structure of the repeating decimals of the form \(0.\overline{abcd}\). Any such decimal can be expressed as a fraction:

\[
0.\overline{abcd} = \frac{abcd}{9999}
\]

where \(abcd\) is a four-digit number (including leading zeros if necessary). This fraction can be simplified to its lowest terms by dividing the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD). The key is to determine how many distinct numerators appear after simplification.

The denominator 9999 factors as:

\[
9999 = 3^2 \times 11 \times 101
\]

For the fraction \(\frac{abcd}{9999}\) to be in its lowest terms, \(abcd\) must not share any prime factors with 9999. Therefore, \(abcd\) must not be divisible by 3, 11, or 101. We need to count the number of integers from 1 to 9999 that are relatively prime to 9999. This is given by Euler's totient function \(\phi(9999)\):

\[
\phi(9999) = 9999 \left(1 - \frac{1}{3}\right)\left(1 - \frac{1}{11}\right)\left(1 - \frac{1}{101}\right) = 9999 \cdot \frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{10}{11} \cdot \frac{100}{101} = 6000
\]

Thus, there are 6000 integers between 1 and 9999 that are relatively prime to 9999. These are the possible numerators when the fractions are in their lowest terms. Therefore, the number of distinct numerators \(N\) is 6000. We need the remainder when \(N\) is divided by 1000:

\[
6000 \mod 1000 = 0
\]

So the remainder when \(N\) is divided by 1000 is:

\[
\boxed{0}
\]
