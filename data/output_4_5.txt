 The problem: 
Let $S$ be the set of all rational numbers that can be expressed as a repeating decimal in the form $0.\overline{abcd},$ where at least one of the digits $a,$ $b,$ $c,$ or $d$ is nonzero. Let $N$ be the number of distinct numerators obtained when numbers in $S$ are written as fractions in lowest terms. For example, both $4$ and $410$ are counted among the distinct numerators for numbers in $S$ because $0.\overline{3636} = \frac{4}{11}$ and $0.\overline{1230} = \frac{410}{3333}.$ Find the remainder when $N$ is divided by $1000.$


To solve the problem, we need to understand the structure of the repeating decimals of the form \(0.\overline{abcd}\). A number of this form can be expressed as a fraction with a denominator of 9999, since \(0.\overline{abcd} = \frac{abcd}{9999}\).

First, we factorize 9999:
\[9999 = 3^2 \times 11 \times 101.\]
When we write \(0.\overline{abcd}\) as a fraction in lowest terms, we need to consider the greatest common divisor (gcd) of \(abcd\) and 9999. The gcd will determine how many times the numerator can be reduced.

The number of distinct numerators is the number of integers from 1 to 9999 that are relatively prime to 9999. This is given by Euler's totient function \(\phi(9999)\):
\[
\phi(9999) = 9999 \left(1 - \frac{1}{3}\right) \left(1 - \frac{1}{11}\right) \left(1 - \frac{1}{101}\right) = 9999 \cdot \frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{10}{11} \cdot \frac{100}{101} = 6000.
\]
Thus, there are 6000 distinct numerators when the fractions are in their lowest terms.

The problem asks for the remainder when \(N\) is divided by 1000. Since \(N = 6000\), we have:
\[6000 \mod 1000 = 0.\]
Therefore, the remainder when \(N\) is divided by 1000 is \(\boxed{0}\).
