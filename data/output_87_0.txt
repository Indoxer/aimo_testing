 The problem: 
Let $N$ be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to $1$, the resulting number is divisible by $7$. Let $Q$ and $R$ be the quotient and remainder, respectively, when $N$ is divided by $1000$. Find $Q+R$.


Alright, so I have this problem here where I need to find the greatest four-digit number N. The special property it has is that if you change any one of its digits to 1, the resulting number should be divisible by 7. Then, once I find N, I need to divide it by 1000, get the quotient Q and remainder R, and then add them together for the final answer.

First off, let me break down what the problem is asking. We're dealing with a four-digit number, so N is between 1000 and 9999. It's the greatest such number, meaning we want the largest possible number that satisfies the given condition. The condition is that changing any single digit to 1 results in a number divisible by 7.

So, let's denote N as a four-digit number with digits A, B, C, D. So, N = 1000A + 100B + 10C + D. Now, the key point is that if we change each digit one at a time to 1, the new numbers must all be divisible by 7.

That means:

1. Changing A to 1: 1000*1 + 100B + 10C + D must be divisible by 7.
2. Changing B to 1: 1000A + 100*1 + 10C + D must be divisible by 7.
3. Changing C to 1: 1000A + 100B + 10*1 + D must be divisible by 7.
4. Changing D to 1: 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1 must be divisible by 7.

So, these four conditions must all hold true simultaneously. My goal is to find the largest N satisfying all four conditions.

Since N is a four-digit number, A can range from 1 to 9, and B, C, D from 0 to 9. But since we want the greatest N, we should start checking from 9999 downwards until we find a number that meets all four conditions.

But checking every number from 9999 downwards seems tedious, so maybe there's a smarter way to approach this.

Let me think about modular arithmetic here because divisibility by 7 is involved. For each altered number (with one digit changed to 1), the result should be congruent to 0 modulo 7.

So, if I consider each altered number, I can write equations based on their remainders modulo 7.

Let me define:

- When A is changed to 1: 1000 + 100B + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7
- When B is changed to 1: 1000A + 100 + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7
- When C is changed to 1: 1000A + 100B + 10 + D ≡ 0 mod 7
- When D is changed to 1: 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7

Let me compute the coefficients modulo 7 first because 1000, 100, 10, and 1 are constants whose remainders modulo 7 will help simplify the equations.

Calculating modulo 7:

- 10 ≡ 3 mod 7
- 100 ≡ 2 mod 7 (since 10^2 = 100; 10 ≡ 3, so 3^2 = 9 ≡ 2 mod 7)
- 1000 ≡ 6 mod 7 (10^3; 3^3 = 27 ≡ 6 mod 7)
- Similarly, 1 is just 1 mod 7.

Wait, hold on, actually, let me correct that. The modulus applies to the entire term, not just the coefficient. So 1000 is 10^3, which is indeed 6 mod 7 because 10^1=10≡3, 10^2=100≡2, 10^3=1000≡6 mod7. Similarly, 100 is 10^2≡2, 10≡3, and 1≡1.

Therefore, replacing each term in the equations with their equivalents modulo 7:

1. When A is changed to 1:
   1000*1 + 100B + 10C + D ≡ 6 + 2B + 3C + D ≡ 0 mod7.

2. When B is changed to 1:
   1000A + 100*1 + 10C + D ≡ 6A + 2 + 3C + D ≡ 0 mod7.

3. When C is changed to 1:
   1000A + 100B + 10*1 + D ≡ 6A + 2B + 3 + D ≡ 0 mod7.

4. When D is changed to 1:
   1000A + 100B + 10C + 1 ≡ 6A + 2B + 3C + 1 ≡ 0 mod7.

So now, we have four congruence equations:

Equation (1): 6 + 2B + 3C + D ≡ 0 mod7

Equation (2): 6A + 2 + 3C + D ≡ 0 mod7

Equation (3): 6A + 2B + 3 + D ≡ 0 mod7

Equation (4): 6A + 2B + 3C + 1 ≡ 0 mod7

Now, our variables are A, B, C, D, each representing digits. So, A ∈ {1,...,9}, B,C,D ∈ {0,...,9}.

We need to solve these four congruences to find A,B,C,D. Since we want the greatest four-digit number N, we'll aim for A as large as possible (starting from 9) and then B, C, D similarly.

Let me see how we can manipulate these equations to find relationships between A, B, C, D.

First, let's subtract Equation (1) from Equation (2):

Equation (2) - Equation (1):
(6A + 2 + 3C + D) - (6 + 2B + 3C + D) ≡ 0 - 0 mod7
Simplify:
6A + 2 - 6 - 2B ≡ 0 mod7
Which is:
6A - 2B - 4 ≡ 0 mod7
Or:
6A - 2B ≡ 4 mod7

Similarly, let's do Equation (3) minus Equation (2):

Equation (3) - Equation (2):
(6A + 2B + 3 + D) - (6A + 2 + 3C + D) ≡ 0 - 0 mod7
Simplify:
2B + 3 - 2 - 3C ≡ 0 mod7
Which is:
2B + 1 - 3C ≡ 0 mod7
Or:
2B - 3C ≡ -1 mod7
Which is equivalent to:
2B - 3C ≡ 6 mod7

Then, Equation (4) minus Equation (3):

Equation (4) - Equation (3):
(6A + 2B + 3C + 1) - (6A + 2B + 3 + D) ≡ 0 - 0 mod7
Simplify:
3C + 1 - 3 - D ≡ 0 mod7
Which is:
3C - D - 2 ≡ 0 mod7
Or:
3C - D ≡ 2 mod7

So, now we have three new equations:

Equation (5): 6A - 2B ≡ 4 mod7

Equation (6): 2B - 3C ≡ 6 mod7

Equation (7): 3C - D ≡ 2 mod7

These might be easier to handle.

Let me see if I can express variables in terms of others.

From Equation (5): 6A - 2B ≡ 4 mod7

I can factor out a 2: 2*(3A - B) ≡ 4 mod7

Divide both sides by 2. Since 2 and 7 are coprime, division is allowed. The inverse of 2 mod7 is 4 because 2*4=8≡1 mod7. Therefore:

Multiply both sides by 4: (3A - B) ≡ 4*4 ≡ 16 ≡ 2 mod7

Thus, 3A - B ≡ 2 mod7 → Equation (8): B ≡ 3A - 2 mod7

Similarly, let's look at Equation (6): 2B - 3C ≡ 6 mod7

We can substitute B from Equation (8) into Equation (6).

From Equation (8): B = 3A - 2 + 7k, where k is an integer.

Substitute into Equation (6):

2*(3A - 2 + 7k) - 3C ≡ 6 mod7

Expand:

6A - 4 + 14k - 3C ≡ 6 mod7

Since 14k ≡ 0 mod7, we can ignore that term.

So:

6A - 4 - 3C ≡ 6 mod7

Bring constants to right:

6A - 3C ≡ 6 + 4 ≡ 10 ≡ 3 mod7

Thus,

6A - 3C ≡ 3 mod7

Factor out 3:

3*(2A - C) ≡ 3 mod7

Divide both sides by 3 (since 3 and 7 are coprime, multiply by inverse of 3 mod7 which is 5, since 3*5=15≡1 mod7)

Multiply both sides by 5:

2A - C ≡ 3*5 ≡ 15 ≡ 1 mod7

Thus,

2A - C ≡ 1 mod7 → Equation (9): C ≡ 2A - 1 mod7

Similarly, go to Equation (7): 3C - D ≡ 2 mod7

Again, substitute C from Equation (9):

3*(2A - 1 + 7m) - D ≡ 2 mod7, where m is an integer.

Expand:

6A - 3 + 21m - D ≡ 2 mod7

Again, 21m ≡0 mod7, so ignore.

Thus:

6A - 3 - D ≡ 2 mod7

Bring constants to RHS:

6A - D ≡ 2 + 3 ≡5 mod7

Hence,

6A - D ≡5 mod7 → Equation (10): D ≡6A -5 mod7

So, now Equations (8)-(10) give us expressions for B, C, D in terms of A modulo7.

Given that A is a digit from 1 to 9, let's consider each possible A starting from 9 downwards, compute B, C, D using Equations (8)-(10), check if they are digits (i.e., integers between 0 and 9), and also verify whether the original four conditions hold.

This seems manageable because we can iterate A from 9 down to 1, compute B, C, D accordingly, check if they are valid digits, and then verify if the four conditions are satisfied.

Let me proceed step by step.

First, note that A can be 9,8,7,...,1. Let's start with A=9.

Case 1: A=9.

Compute B, C, D:

From Equation (8): B ≡3*9 -2 ≡27 -2≡25≡4 mod7 (since 25/7=3*7=21, 25-21=4). Thus, B=4 +7k. Since B is a digit, k can be 0 or possibly 1 (if 4+7=11, but 11>9, so invalid). Hence, B=4.

From Equation (9): C ≡2*9 -1≡18-1=17≡3 mod7 (since 17-14=3). So, C=3 +7m. Since C is a digit, m=0 gives C=3; m=1 would give 10, which is invalid. So, C=3.

From Equation (10): D≡6*9 -5≡54-5=49≡0 mod7 (since 49 is 7*7). So, D=0 +7n. Since D is a digit, n=0 gives D=0; n=1 would give 7, which is still okay? Wait, no, wait: 49≡0 mod7, so D≡0 mod7. So, D can be 0 or 7. However, D must satisfy D≡0 mod7, so D=0 or 7.

So, possibilities:

D=0 or D=7.

Now, with A=9, B=4, C=3, D=0 or 7.

So, the number N would be either 9430 or 9437.

Now, we need to check if changing any single digit to 1 makes the number divisible by7.

But before that, let's remember that N is supposed to be the greatest four-digit number, so 9437 is larger than 9430, so perhaps we should check 9437 first.

But let's test N=9437.

Check each alteration:

1. Change A to 1: 1437. Check if 1437 divisible by7?

Compute 1437 /7: 7*205=1435, so 1437-1435=2. Remainder 2≠0. So, 1437 isn't divisible by7. Thus, 9437 doesn't satisfy the condition.

Next, try N=9430.

Change A to1: 1430. Compute 1430 /7: 7*204=1428, 1430-1428=2. Remainder 2≠0. Not divisible.

Hmm, so neither 9437 nor 9430 satisfy the condition when changing A to1. That suggests something is wrong with my approach, because according to the equations, they should satisfy the conditions.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the modular calculations or substitutions.

Let me double-check.

Starting with A=9.

Equation (8): B ≡3*9 -2=27-2=25≡4 mod7 ⇒ B=4.

Equation (9): C≡2*9 -1=17≡3 mod7 ⇒ C=3.

Equation (10): D≡6*9 -5=54-5=49≡0 mod7 ⇒ D=0 or 7.

So, N could be 9430 or 9437.

But when we checked altering A to1, both resulted in non-divisible numbers. That indicates either the equations are incorrect or perhaps the modulus operations didn't account for something.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the earlier steps.

Wait, let me re-examine the equations.

Original equations:

1. 6 + 2B + 3C + D ≡0 mod7

2. 6A +2 + 3C + D ≡0 mod7

3. 6A + 2B + 3 + D ≡0 mod7

4. 6A + 2B + 3C +1 ≡0 mod7

Then, equation (2)-(1):

6A +2 +3C +D -6 -2B -3C -D=6A -2B -4≡0 mod7 ⇒6A -2B≡4 mod7, correct.

Equation (3)-(2):

6A +2B +3 + D -6A -2 -3C -D=2B -3C +1≡0 mod7 ⇒2B -3C≡-1≡6 mod7, correct.

Equation (4)-(3):

6A +2B +3C +1 -6A -2B -3 -D=3C -D -2≡0 mod7 ⇒3C -D≡2 mod7, correct.

Then, moving to substitution:

Equation (5):6A -2B≡4⇒2*(3A - B)=4⇒3A - B≡2 mod7⇒B≡3A -2 mod7, correct.

Equation (6):2B -3C≡6⇒substituted B=3A -2 +7k⇒2*(3A -2) -3C≡6⇒6A -4 -3C≡6⇒6A -3C≡10≡3 mod7⇒3*(2A - C)≡3⇒2A - C≡1 mod7⇒C≡2A -1 mod7, correct.

Equation (7):3C - D≡2⇒substituted C=2A -1 +7m⇒3*(2A -1) - D≡2⇒6A -3 -D≡2⇒6A - D≡5 mod7⇒D≡6A -5 mod7, correct.

So, substitution steps seem correct.

Thus, why did N=9430 and N=9437 fail the initial test?

Wait, perhaps my substitution is wrong? Or perhaps I need to check another condition.

Wait, actually, the process of substituting led to N being 9430 or 9437, but when we alter A, we get 1430 or1437, which aren't divisible by7. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I need to check more than just changing A. Maybe the issue is that in addition to changing A, we have to ensure that changing B, C, D also gives divisibility. So, maybe N=9430 or 9437 don't satisfy all four conditions. Alternatively, perhaps my process is missing something.

Wait, another thought: the equations were derived correctly, so if A=9, B=4, C=3, D=0 or7, then the four conditions should hold. Let me manually check each condition for N=9430.

Condition1: Change A to1:1430. Is 1430 divisible by7? 7*204=1428, 1430-1428=2, so remainder 2. Not divisible.

Condition2: Change B to1:9130. Is 9130 divisible by7? Let's check: 7*1304=9128, 9130-9128=2. Remainder 2 again. Not divisible.

Condition3: Change C to1:9410. 9410 /7: 7*1344=9408, 9410-9408=2. Remainder 2. Not divisible.

Condition4: Change D to1:9431. 9431 /7: Let's compute 7*1347=9429, 9431-9429=2. Remainder 2. Not divisible.

So, all four alterations result in numbers with remainder 2 when divided by7, which is bad. So, N=9430 doesn't satisfy the conditions.

Same with N=9437:

Condition1: Change A to1:1437. 1437/7: 7*205=1435, 1437-1435=2. Remainder 2.

Condition2: Change B to1:9137. 9137/7: 7*1305=9135, 9137-9135=2. Remainder 2.

Condition3: Change C to1:9417. 9417/7: 7*1345=9415, 9417-9415=2. Remainder 2.

Condition4: Change D to1:9431. As above, remainder 2.

So, same issue. Thus, even though N=9430 and 9437 satisfy the modular equations, when we actually check the conditions, they fail because the resulting numbers after changing a digit have remainder 2 instead of 0. That suggests that the system of equations may not capture the entire picture. Why is that?

Wait, perhaps because when we derived the equations, we considered only the individual effects, but maybe the carry-over when changing digits affects the value. Wait, but changing a digit in a specific place should only affect that particular digit's contribution, not others, unless there's a carry-over which complicates things.

But in reality, when you change a digit in a number, the other digits remain the same. So, for example, changing A in ABCD to 1 is simply 1BCD, which is 1000 + B*100 + C*10 + D. Similarly, changing B is A*1000 +1*100 + C*10 + D. So, the changes don't interfere with each other. Therefore, the equations should hold.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the modulus calculations.

Wait, let's recompute for N=9430.

Compute N=9430.

Check Condition1: Change A to1:1430.

1430 mod7: 1430 /7=204*7=1428, 1430-1428=2, so 1430≡2 mod7.

Similarly, 9130: 9130 mod7. 9130-7*1304=9130-9128=2.

9410 mod7: 9410-7*1344=9410-9408=2.

9431 mod7: 9431-7*1347=9431-9429=2.

So, all four changes give remainder 2, not 0.

Wait, so perhaps N=9430 and 9437 are invalid.

But according to the modular equations, they should satisfy the conditions.

Wait, maybe the mistake is that when solving the equations, we didn't consider that some variables may wrap around multiple times beyond mod7, hence leading to discrepancies when checking actual numbers.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to also consider higher multiples or different k values when expressing B, C, D in terms of A.

Wait, let's go back. When we had Equation (8): B ≡3A -2 mod7. So, B can be 3A -2 plus any multiple of7, but since B is a digit (0-9), only limited options.

Similarly, for C and D.

In the case of A=9, B=4, C=3, D=0 or7.

But, perhaps there are other solutions where B, C, D are higher digits.

Wait, for instance, D≡6A -5 mod7. For A=9, 6*9=54, 54-5=49≡0 mod7, so D=0 or7 as we had.

Similarly, for C≡2A -1 mod7: 2*9 -1=17≡3 mod7, so C=3 or 10. But 10 is invalid, so C=3.

For B≡3A -2 mod7: 3*9 -2=25≡4 mod7, so B=4 or 11. 11 is invalid, so B=4.

So, only two options for D:0 or7, same with B and C fixed at4 and3.

Thus, N=9430 or9437.

But as we saw, both failed when checking.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the equations.

Wait, let me recast the problem.

Let me suppose that N is a four-digit number, such that changing any digit to1 makes it divisible by7.

So, for each digit position i, changing digit d_i to1 in N gives a number divisible by7.

So, for each i∈{A,B,C,D}, replacing d_i with1 gives a number ≡0 mod7.

So, we can model each digit replacement as:

For each digit position, the value of N with that digit replaced by1 is divisible by7.

So, mathematically, for each digit position i, let’s define:

N_i = N - d_i * 10^{pos(i)} + 1 * 10^{pos(i)} ≡0 mod7.

Where pos(i) is the positional value (e.g., thousands, hundreds, etc.)

So, for each digit, this gives a congruence.

Therefore, for each digit, we have:

(N - d_i * 10^{pos(i)} + 10^{pos(i)}) ≡0 mod7.

Which simplifies to:

N + (1 - d_i)*10^{pos(i)} ≡0 mod7.

So, for each digit, N ≡ (d_i -1)*10^{pos(i)} mod7.

So, since N is fixed, the right-hand side must be equal for each digit.

Therefore, (d_i -1)*10^{pos(i)} ≡ same value mod7 for each digit.

Therefore, for each digit, (d_i -1)*10^{pos(i)} ≡ k mod7, where k is a constant.

So, let's denote k as this common value. Then, for each digit:

(d_A -1)*1000 ≡k mod7,

(d_B -1)*100 ≡k mod7,

(d_C -1)*10 ≡k mod7,

(d_D -1)*1 ≡k mod7.

So, these four equations must hold.

Given that, we can compute 10^{pos} mod7 for each position:

- 10^0=1≡1 mod7

- 10^1=10≡3 mod7

- 10^2=100≡2 mod7

- 10^3=1000≡6 mod7

So, we have:

For thousands place (pos=3): (d_A -1)*6 ≡k mod7

For hundreds place (pos=2): (d_B -1)*2 ≡k mod7

For tens place (pos=1): (d_C -1)*3 ≡k mod7

For units place (pos=0): (d_D -1)*1 ≡k mod7

Thus, we can write:

1. 6*(d_A -1) ≡k mod7

2. 2*(d_B -1) ≡k mod7

3. 3*(d_C -1) ≡k mod7

4. (d_D -1) ≡k mod7

So, all four expressions equal to k mod7.

Therefore, equate them pairwise.

From 1 and 2:

6*(d_A -1) ≡2*(d_B -1) mod7

Simplify:

6d_A -6 ≡2d_B -2 mod7

Bring like terms:

6d_A -2d_B ≡4 mod7

Similarly, from 2 and3:

2*(d_B -1) ≡3*(d_C -1) mod7

Which is:

2d_B -2 ≡3d_C -3 mod7

Bringing terms:

2d_B -3d_C ≡-1 mod7 ⇒2d_B -3d_C ≡6 mod7

From3 and4:

3*(d_C -1) ≡(d_D -1) mod7

Which is:

3d_C -3 ≡d_D -1 mod7 ⇒3d_C -d_D ≡2 mod7

So, now, we have three equations:

Equation (I):6d_A -2d_B ≡4 mod7

Equation (II):2d_B -3d_C ≡6 mod7

Equation (III):3d_C -d_D ≡2 mod7

Additionally, from equation4: d_D ≡k +1 mod7

But perhaps integrating this into the previous equations.

Wait, let's see if we can express all variables in terms of one variable.

Let me attempt to express everything in terms of d_A.

From Equation (I):6d_A -2d_B ≡4 mod7

We can solve for d_B:

-2d_B ≡4 -6d_A mod7

Multiply both sides by (-2)^{-1} mod7. Since -2≡5 mod7, and 5^{-1} is 3 because 5*3=15≡1 mod7.

Thus,

d_B ≡(4 -6d_A)*(-2)^{-1}≡(4 -6d_A)*3 mod7

Compute (4 -6d_A)*3:

=12 -18d_A≡12 -4d_A mod7 (since 18≡4 mod7)

12 mod7=5, so:

5 -4d_A mod7.

Thus,

d_B ≡5 -4d_A mod7.

Similarly, from Equation (II):2d_B -3d_C ≡6 mod7

Express d_C:

-3d_C ≡6 -2d_B mod7

Multiply both sides by (-3)^{-1} mod7. Since -3≡4 mod7, and 4^{-1}=2 because 4*2=8≡1 mod7.

Thus,

d_C≡(6 -2d_B)*2 mod7

Compute:

12 -4d_B≡12 -4d_B mod7

12≡5, so:

5 -4d_B mod7.

But from above, d_B≡5 -4d_A mod7.

Thus, plug into d_C:

d_C ≡5 -4*(5 -4d_A) mod7

Compute:

5 -20 +16d_A≡5 -20 +16d_A≡(5 -20) +16d_A≡-15 +16d_A≡-15 +16d_A mod7

Convert to mod7:

-15 mod7: -15 +21=6

16 mod7:16-14=2

Thus,

d_C≡6 +2d_A mod7.

Similarly, from Equation (III):3d_C -d_D ≡2 mod7

Express d_D:

-d_D≡2 -3d_C mod7 ⇒d_D≡3d_C -2 mod7.

From above, d_C≡6 +2d_A mod7.

Thus,

d_D≡3*(6 +2d_A) -2≡18 +6d_A -2≡16 +6d_A≡16 -1 mod7 (since 16≡2 mod7)

16-1=15≡1 mod7.

Wait, 16 mod7 is 2, so:

2 +6d_A mod7.

Thus, d_D≡6d_A +2 mod7.

So, summarizing:

d_B ≡5 -4d_A mod7,

d_C≡6 +2d_A mod7,

d_D≡6d_A +2 mod7.

Moreover, since each digit d_A,d_B,d_C,d_D must be between0 and9, inclusive.

Also, d_A is from1-9, d_B,d_C,d_D from0-9.

Our task is to choose d_A (from1-9) such that d_B,d_C,d_D are digits (0-9), and then among those, pick the maximum N=1000d_A +100d_B +10d_C +d_D.

So, let's structure this:

For each d_A from9 down to1:

1. Compute d_B=(5 -4d_A) mod7. If negative, adjust to positive by adding7.

2. Compute d_C=(6 +2d_A) mod7. Similarly adjust if necessary.

3. Compute d_D=(6d_A +2) mod7. Adjust if necessary.

Then, check if d_B,d_C,d_D are within 0-9.

If yes, then form N=1000d_A +100d_B +10d_C +d_D, and keep track of the maximum such N.

Once we find such N, we can stop because we started from the highest d_A.

So, let me create a table for d_A=9 down to1:

Let's start with d_A=9.

d_A=9:

Compute d_B=(5 -4*9)=5 -36=-31≡-31 mod7. Compute -31 divided by7: 7*4=28, -31-(-28)=-3, so -31≡-3≡4 mod7. So, d_B=4.

d_C=(6 +2*9)=6 +18=24≡24 mod7. 24-21=3, so d_C=3.

d_D=(6*9 +2)=54 +2=56≡56 mod7=0. So, d_D=0.

Thus, N=9 4 3 0=9430.

Check if d_B,d_C,d_D are digits: yes, 4,3,0 are all ≤9.

So, N=9430 is a candidate.

But as we saw earlier, changing any digit to1 doesn't yield a number divisible by7. So, 9430 is invalid.

Proceed to d_A=8.

d_A=8:

d_B=(5 -4*8)=5 -32=-27≡-27 mod7. 7*4=28, so -27≡1 mod7. Thus, d_B=1.

d_C=(6 +2*8)=6 +16=22≡22 mod7=1 (since 22-21=1). So, d_C=1.

d_D=(6*8 +2)=48 +2=50≡50 mod7. 7*7=49, so 50≡1 mod7. Thus, d_D=1.

Thus, N=8 1 1 1=8111.

Check digits:8,1,1,1 are all digits.

Now, let's check if N=8111 satisfies the conditions.

Compute N=8111.

Check changing each digit to1:

1. Change A to1:1111. 1111 /7: 7*158=1106, 1111-1106=5. Not divisible.

Thus, fails immediately. So, discard.

Proceed to d_A=7.

d_A=7:

d_B=(5 -4*7)=5 -28=-23≡-23 mod7. 7*3=21, so -23≡-23 +28=5 mod7. Thus, d_B=5.

d_C=(6 +2*7)=6 +14=20≡20 mod7=6 (since 20-14=6). So, d_C=6.

d_D=(6*7 +2)=42 +2=44≡44 mod7. 7*6=42, so 44≡2 mod7. Thus, d_D=2.

Thus, N=7 5 6 2=7562.

Check digits:7,5,6,2 are all digits.

Test changing each digit to1:

1. Change A to1:1562. 1562 /7: 7*223=1561, 1562-1561=1. Remainder1≠0.

Fails. So, discard.

Proceed to d_A=6.

d_A=6:

d_B=(5 -4*6)=5 -24=-19≡-19 mod7. 7*3=21, so -19≡2 mod7. Thus, d_B=2.

d_C=(6 +2*6)=6 +12=18≡18 mod7=4 (18-14=4). So, d_C=4.

d_D=(6*6 +2)=36 +2=38≡38 mod7. 7*5=35, so 38≡3 mod7. Thus, d_D=3.

Thus, N=6 2 4 3=6243.

Check digits:6,2,4,3.

Test changing each digit to1:

1. Change A to1:1243. 1243 /7: 7*177=1239, 1243-1239=4. Remainder4≠0.

Fails. Discard.

Proceed to d_A=5.

d_A=5:

d_B=(5 -4*5)=5 -20=-15≡-15 mod7. 7*3=21, so -15≡6 mod7. Thus, d_B=6.

d_C=(6 +2*5)=6 +10=16≡16 mod7=2 (16-14=2). So, d_C=2.

d_D=(6*5 +2)=30 +2=32≡32 mod7. 7*4=28, so 32≡4 mod7. Thus, d_D=4.

Thus, N=5 6 2 4=5624.

Check digits:5,6,2,4.

Test changing each digit to1:

1. Change A to1:1624. 1624 /7: 7*232=1624. So, 1624 is divisible by7. Good.

2. Change B to1:5124. 5124 /7: 7*732=5124. So, divisible. Good.

3. Change C to1:5614. 5614 /7: 7*802=5614. Divisible. Good.

4. Change D to1:5621. 5621 /7: 7*803=5621. Divisible. Good.

Wow, so N=5624 satisfies all four conditions!

So, N=5624 is a candidate. But we need to check if there is a larger N.

But before that, let me check the next digits in case I missed a larger N.

Proceeding to d_A=4.

d_A=4:

d_B=(5 -4*4)=5 -16=-11≡-11 mod7. 7*2=14, so -11≡3 mod7. Thus, d_B=3.

d_C=(6 +2*4)=6 +8=14≡14 mod7=0. So, d_C=0.

d_D=(6*4 +2)=24 +2=26≡26 mod7. 26-21=5. So, d_D=5.

Thus, N=4 3 0 5=4305.

Check digits:4,3,0,5.

Test changing each digit to1:

1. Change A to1:1305. 1305 /7: 7*186=1302, 1305-1302=3. Remainder3≠0.

Fails. Discard.

Proceed to d_A=3.

d_A=3:

d_B=(5 -4*3)=5 -12=-7≡0 mod7. So, d_B=0.

d_C=(6 +2*3)=6 +6=12≡12 mod7=5. So, d_C=5.

d_D=(6*3 +2)=18 +2=20≡20 mod7=6. So, d_D=6.

Thus, N=3 0 5 6=3056.

Check digits:3,0,5,6.

Test changing each digit to1:

1. Change A to1:1056. 1056 /7: 7*150=1050, 1056-1050=6. Remainder6≠0.

Fails. Discard.

Proceed to d_A=2.

d_A=2:

d_B=(5 -4*2)=5 -8=-3≡4 mod7. Thus, d_B=4.

d_C=(6 +2*2)=6 +4=10≡10 mod7=3. So, d_C=3.

d_D=(6*2 +2)=12 +2=14≡0 mod7. So, d_D=0.

Thus, N=2 4 3 0=2430.

Check digits:2,4,3,0.

Test changing each digit to1:

1. Change A to1:1430. 1430 /7: 7*204=1428, 1430-1428=2. Remainder2≠0.

Fails. Discard.

Proceed to d_A=1.

d_A=1:

d_B=(5 -4*1)=5 -4=1 mod7. So, d_B=1.

d_C=(6 +2*1)=6 +2=8 mod7=1. So, d_C=1.

d_D=(6*1 +2)=6 +2=8 mod7=1. So, d_D=1.

Thus, N=1 1 1 1=1111.

Check digits:1,1,1,1.

Test changing each digit to1: Well, changing any digit to1 is still1111, which is obviously divisible by7. But N=1111 is much smaller than 5624, so irrelevant.

So, after going through all d_A from9 down to1, the only N that satisfies all four conditions is N=5624.

Hence, N=5624.

Now, compute Q and R where N=Q*1000 + R. So, Q=5, R=624.

Thus, Q+R=5 +624=629.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{629}
</think>

To solve the problem, we need to find the greatest four-digit number \( N \) such that changing any single digit to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. We then need to determine \( Q \) and \( R \) when \( N \) is divided by 1000, and find \( Q + R \).

First, we denote \( N \) as a four-digit number with digits \( A, B, C, D \). Changing any digit to 1 should result in a number divisible by 7. This gives us four conditions:

1. Changing \( A \) to 1: \( 1000 + 100B + 10C + D \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \)
2. Changing \( B \) to 1: \( 1000A + 100 + 10C + D \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \)
3. Changing \( C \) to 1: \( 1000A + 100B + 10 + D \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \)
4. Changing \( D \) to 1: \( 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \)

We convert these conditions into modular arithmetic equations and simplify them. After solving these equations, we find that:

- \( B \equiv 3A - 2 \pmod{7} \)
- \( C \equiv 2A - 1 \pmod{7} \)
- \( D \equiv 6A - 5 \pmod{7} \)

We then check each possible value of \( A \) from 9 down to 1, ensuring that \( B, C, D \) are valid digits (0-9). 

After thorough checking, we find that when \( A = 5 \), the digits \( B, C, D \) are 6, 2, and 4 respectively, forming the number 5624. This number satisfies all four conditions.

Finally, we compute \( Q \) and \( R \) for \( N = 5624 \):
- \( Q = 5 \)
- \( R = 624 \)

Thus, \( Q + R = 5 + 624 = 629 \).

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{629}
\]
