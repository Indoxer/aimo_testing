 The problem: 
Let $w = \dfrac{\sqrt{3} + i}{2}$ and $z = \dfrac{-1 + i\sqrt{3}}{2},$ where $i = \sqrt{-1}.$ Find the number of ordered pairs $(r,s)$ of positive integers not exceeding $100$ that satisfy the equation $i \cdot w^r = z^s.$


To solve the problem, we first express \( w \) and \( z \) in polar form. Notice that both \( w \) and \( z \) are complex numbers with magnitude 1, since:

\[
|w| = \left| \frac{\sqrt{3} + i}{2} \right| = \frac{\sqrt{(\sqrt{3})^2 + 1^2}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3+1}}{2} = \frac{2}{2} = 1,
\]
and similarly,
\[
|z| = \left| \frac{-1 + i\sqrt{3}}{2} \right| = \frac{\sqrt{(-1)^2 + (\sqrt{3})^2}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{1+3}}{2} = \frac{2}{2} = 1.
\]

Next, we determine the arguments of \( w \) and \( z \). The argument of \( w \) is:
\[
\arg(w) = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\right) = \frac{\pi}{6}.
\]
The argument of \( z \) is:
\[
\arg(z) = \pi - \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{1}\right) = \pi - \frac{\pi}{3} = \frac{2\pi}{3}.
\]

Thus, we can write \( w \) and \( z \) in polar form as:
\[
w = e^{i\pi/6}, \quad z = e^{i2\pi/3}.
\]

We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((r, s)\) such that:
\[
i \cdot w^r = z^s.
\]
Substituting the polar forms, we get:
\[
i \cdot e^{i\pi r/6} = e^{is2\pi/3}.
\]
Since \( i = e^{i\pi/2} \), we can rewrite the equation as:
\[
e^{i\pi/2} \cdot e^{i\pi r/6} = e^{is2\pi/3},
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
e^{i(\pi/2 + \pi r/6)} = e^{is2\pi/3}.
\]
This implies:
\[
\frac{\pi}{2} + \frac{\pi r}{6} = \frac{2\pi s}{3} + 2k\pi \quad \text{for some integer } k.
\]
Dividing through by \(\pi\), we get:
\[
\frac{1}{2} + \frac{r}{6} = \frac{2s}{3} + 2k.
\]
Multiplying through by 6, we obtain:
\[
3 + r = 4s + 12k.
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
r = 4s + 12k - 3.
\]
Since \( r \) and \( s \) are positive integers not exceeding 100, we need to find the values of \( s \) and \( k \) such that \( 1 \leq r \leq 100 \). This gives us:
\[
1 \leq 4s + 12k - 3 \leq 100,
\]
or equivalently:
\[
4 \leq 4s + 12k \leq 103.
\]
Dividing through by 4, we get:
\[
1 \leq s + 3k \leq 25.75.
\]
Since \( s \) and \( k \) are integers, we have:
\[
1 \leq s + 3k \leq 25.
\]
For each fixed \( s \) from 1 to 25, \( k \) can take any integer value such that \( 1 \leq s + 3k \leq 25 \). Solving for \( k \), we get:
\[
\frac{s-1}{3} \leq k \leq \frac{25-s}{3}.
\]
The number of integer values for \( k \) is:
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{25-s}{3} \right\rfloor - \left\lceil \frac{s-1}{3} \right\rceil + 1.
\]
We need to check the range of \( s \) to ensure that the number of valid \( k \) values is always at least 1. For \( s = 1 \), \( k \) ranges from 0 to 8, giving 9 values. For \( s = 2 \), \( k \) ranges from 0 to 8, giving 9 values. For \( s = 3 \), \( k \) ranges from 1 to 8, giving 8 values. For \( s = 4 \), \( k \) ranges from 1 to 8, giving 8 values. For \( s = 5 \), \( k \) ranges from 1 to 8, giving 8 values. For \( s = 6 \), \( k \) ranges from 2 to 8, giving 7 values. For \( s = 7 \), \( k \) ranges from 2 to 8, giving 7 values. For \( s = 8 \), \( k \) ranges from 2 to 8, giving 7 values. For \( s = 9 \), \( k \) ranges from 3 to 8, giving 6 values. For \( s = 10 \), \( k \) ranges from 3 to 8, giving 6 values. For \( s = 11 \), \( k \) ranges from 3 to 8, giving 6 values. For \( s = 12 \), \( k \) ranges from 4 to 8, giving 5 values. For \( s = 13 \), \( k \) ranges from 4 to 8, giving 5 values. For \( s = 14 \), \( k \) ranges from 4 to 8, giving 5 values. For \( s = 15 \), \( k \) ranges from 5 to 8, giving 4 values. For \( s = 16 \), \( k \) ranges from 5 to 8, giving 4 values. For \( s = 17 \), \( k \) ranges from 5 to 8, giving 4 values. For \( s = 18 \), \( k \) ranges from 6 to 8, giving 3 values. For \( s = 19 \), \( k \) ranges from 6 to 8, giving 3 values. For \( s = 20 \), \( k \) ranges from 6 to 8, giving 3 values. For \( s = 21 \), \( k \) ranges from 7 to 8, giving 2 values. For \( s = 22 \), \( k \) ranges from 7 to 8, giving 2 values. For \( s = 23 \), \( k \) ranges from 7 to 8, giving 2 values. For \( s = 24 \), \( k \) ranges from 8 to 8, giving 1 value. For \( s = 25 \), \( k \) ranges from 8 to 8, giving 1 value.

Summing these, we get:
\[
9 + 8 \times 18 + 7 \times 6 + 6 \times 6 + 5 \times 6 + 4 \times 5 + 3 \times 4 + 2 \times 2 + 1 \times 2 = 9 + 144 + 42 + 36 + 30 + 20 + 12 + 4 + 2 = 299.
\]
Thus, the number of ordered pairs \((r, s)\) is \(\boxed{299}\).
