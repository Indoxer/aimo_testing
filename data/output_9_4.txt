 The problem: 
Let $w = \dfrac{\sqrt{3} + i}{2}$ and $z = \dfrac{-1 + i\sqrt{3}}{2},$ where $i = \sqrt{-1}.$ Find the number of ordered pairs $(r,s)$ of positive integers not exceeding $100$ that satisfy the equation $i \cdot w^r = z^s.$


To solve the problem, we first need to express \(w\) and \(z\) in polar form. The complex number \(w = \frac{\sqrt{3} + i}{2}\) can be written as \(w = \cos \frac{\pi}{6} + i \sin \frac{\pi}{6}\), which means \(w = e^{i\pi/6}\). Similarly, the complex number \(z = \frac{-1 + i\sqrt{3}}{2}\) can be written as \(z = \cos \frac{2\pi}{3} + i \sin \frac{2\pi}{3}\), which means \(z = e^{i2\pi/3}\).

We need to find the values of \(r\) and \(s\) such that \(i \cdot w^r = z^s\). First, we express \(i\) in exponential form: \(i = e^{i\pi/2}\). Therefore, the equation becomes:
\[ e^{i\pi/2} \cdot e^{ir\pi/6} = e^{is2\pi/3}. \]
This simplifies to:
\[ e^{i(\pi/2 + r\pi/6)} = e^{is2\pi/3}. \]
Since the exponents must be equal up to an integer multiple of \(2\pi i\), we have:
\[ \frac{\pi}{2} + \frac{r\pi}{6} = \frac{2s\pi}{3} + 2k\pi \]
for some integer \(k\). Dividing through by \(\pi\), we get:
\[ \frac{1}{2} + \frac{r}{6} = \frac{2s}{3} + 2k. \]
Multiplying through by 6, we obtain:
\[ 3 + r = 4s + 12k. \]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[ r = 4s + 12k - 3. \]
We need \(r\) and \(s\) to be positive integers not exceeding 100. Therefore, we need to find the range of \(s\) such that \(r\) is a positive integer not exceeding 100. This means:
\[ 1 \leq 4s + 12k - 3 \leq 100. \]
Adding 3 to all parts of the inequality, we get:
\[ 4 \leq 4s + 12k \leq 103. \]
Dividing through by 4, we get:
\[ 1 \leq s + 3k \leq 25.75. \]
Since \(s\) and \(k\) are integers, we have:
\[ 1 \leq s + 3k \leq 25. \]
For each integer value of \(s\) from 1 to 25, \(k\) can take on integer values such that \(1 \leq s + 3k \leq 25\). Solving for \(k\), we get:
\[ \frac{s-1}{3} \leq k \leq \frac{25-s}{3}. \]
The number of integer values for \(k\) is the number of integers in the interval \(\left[ \frac{s-1}{3}, \frac{25-s}{3} \right]\). The length of this interval is:
\[ \left\lfloor \frac{25-s}{3} \right\rfloor - \left\lceil \frac{s-1}{3} \right\rceil + 1. \]
We need to check the endpoints. For \(s = 1\), the interval is \([0, 8]\), which has 9 values. For \(s = 2\), the interval is \([0, 8]\), which has 9 values. For \(s = 3\), the interval is \([1, 8]\), which has 8 values. And so on. The pattern is that for \(s = 1, 2, 3, \ldots, 25\), the number of values for \(k\) is \(8\) for \(s = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25\). Therefore, the total number of ordered pairs \((r, s)\) is:
\[ 9 \cdot 8 + 16 \cdot 7 + 16 \cdot 6 + 16 \cdot 5 + 16 \cdot 4 + 16 \cdot 3 + 16 \cdot 2 + 16 \cdot 1 = 72 + 112 + 96 + 80 + 64 + 48 + 32 + 16 = 520. \]
Thus, the number of ordered pairs \((r, s)\) is \(\boxed{80}\). \]```
```The final answer is \(\boxed{80}\).```
