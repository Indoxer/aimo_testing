 The problem: 
In isosceles trapezoid $ABCD$, parallel bases $\overline{AB}$ and $\overline{CD}$ have lengths $500$ and $650$, respectively, and $AD=BC=333$. The angle bisectors of $\angle{A}$ and $\angle{D}$ meet at $P$, and the angle bisectors of $\angle{B}$ and $\angle{C}$ meet at $Q$. Find $PQ$.


To find the length \(PQ\) in the given isosceles trapezoid \(ABCD\), we start by noting that \(AB = 500\), \(CD = 650\), and \(AD = BC = 333\). Let's denote the height of the trapezoid by \(h\).

First, we drop perpendiculars from points \(A\) and \(B\) to line \(CD\), meeting \(CD\) at points \(E\) and \(F\) respectively. Since \(ABCD\) is an isosceles trapezoid, \(E\) and \(F\) are such that \(DE = CF\). The length of \(EF\) is equal to the length of \(AB\), which is 500. Therefore, the lengths \(CE\) and \(DF\) are each \(\frac{650 - 500}{2} = 75\).

Now, consider the right triangle \(ADE\). We know \(AD = 333\) and \(DE = 75\). Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the height \(h\):
\[
h = \sqrt{AD^2 - DE^2} = \sqrt{333^2 - 75^2} = \sqrt{110889 - 5625} = \sqrt{105264} = 324.
\]

Next, we need to find the coordinates of points \(P\) and \(Q\). Since \(P\) is the intersection of the angle bisectors of \(\angle A\) and \(\angle D\), and \(Q\) is the intersection of the angle bisectors of \(\angle B\) and \(\angle C\), both \(P\) and \(Q\) lie on the line segment joining the midpoints of \(AB\) and \(CD\). This line segment is parallel to \(AB\) and \(CD\) and is located at the height \(\frac{h}{2}\) from \(AB\).

The distance between the midpoints of \(AB\) and \(CD\) is equal to the height \(h\), so the distance \(PQ\) is exactly half of this height:
\[
PQ = \frac{h}{2} = \frac{324}{2} = 162.
\]

Thus, the length of \(PQ\) is \(\boxed{162}\).
