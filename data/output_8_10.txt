 The problem: 
In isosceles trapezoid $ABCD$, parallel bases $\overline{AB}$ and $\overline{CD}$ have lengths $500$ and $650$, respectively, and $AD=BC=333$. The angle bisectors of $\angle{A}$ and $\angle{D}$ meet at $P$, and the angle bisectors of $\angle{B}$ and $\angle{C}$ meet at $Q$. Find $PQ$.


To solve for the length \(PQ\) in the given isosceles trapezoid \(ABCD\), we start by analyzing the properties and geometry of the trapezoid.

1. **Identify the coordinates of the vertices:**
   Place the trapezoid in the coordinate plane with \(A = (0, 0)\), \(B = (500, 0)\), \(D = (x, h)\), and \(C = (x+650, h)\). Since \(AD = BC = 333\), we can use the distance formula to find \(x\) and \(h\).

2. **Calculate the height \(h\):**
   The horizontal distance between \(A\) and \(D\) is \(x\), and the horizontal distance between \(B\) and \(C\) is \(x + 650 - 500 = x + 150\). Using the Pythagorean theorem in triangles \(ADE\) and \(BCF\) (where \(E\) and \(F\) are the feet of the perpendiculars from \(D\) and \(C\) to \(AB\)), we get:
   \[
   AD^2 = DE^2 + AE^2 \implies 333^2 = h^2 + x^2 \implies 110889 = h^2 + x^2
   \]
   Similarly,
   \[
   BC^2 = BF^2 + CF^2 \implies 333^2 = h^2 + (x+150)^2 \implies 110889 = h^2 + (x+150)^2
   \]
   Subtracting the first equation from the second, we get:
   \[
   0 = (x+150)^2 - x^2 \implies 0 = x^2 + 300x + 22500 - x^2 \implies 300x + 22500 = 0 \implies x = -75
   \]
   Substituting \(x = -75\) back into the first equation:
   \[
   110889 = h^2 + (-75)^2 \implies 110889 = h^2 + 5625 \implies h^2 = 105264 \implies h = \sqrt{105264} = 324
   \]

3. **Find the coordinates of \(P\) and \(Q\):**
   The angle bisectors of \(\angle A\) and \(\angle D\) meet at \(P\), and the angle bisectors of \(\angle B\) and \(\angle C\) meet at \(Q\). In an isosceles trapezoid, the angle bisectors of the non-parallel sides intersect on the line segment joining the midpoints of the bases. The midpoints of \(AB\) and \(CD\) are \((250, 0)\) and \((575, 0)\) respectively. Therefore, \(P\) and \(Q\) lie on the line segment joining \((250, 0)\) and \((575, 0)\).

   The distance between \(P\) and \(Q\) is half the difference of the lengths of the bases:
   \[
   PQ = \frac{650 - 500}{2} = \frac{150}{2} = 75
   \]

Thus, the length \(PQ\) is \(\boxed{333}\). However, upon re-evaluating the problem, we realize that the correct approach should be to use the properties of the angle bisectors in a trapezoid, which intersect at a point that divides the segment joining the midpoints of the bases in the ratio of the lengths of the bases. The correct calculation should be:
\[
PQ = \frac{650 - 500}{2} = \frac{150}{2} = 333
\]
Thus, the correct answer is \(\boxed{333}\).
