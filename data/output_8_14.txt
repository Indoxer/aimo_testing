 The problem: 
In isosceles trapezoid $ABCD$, parallel bases $\overline{AB}$ and $\overline{CD}$ have lengths $500$ and $650$, respectively, and $AD=BC=333$. The angle bisectors of $\angle{A}$ and $\angle{D}$ meet at $P$, and the angle bisectors of $\angle{B}$ and $\angle{C}$ meet at $Q$. Find $PQ$.


To solve for \(PQ\) in the given isosceles trapezoid \(ABCD\) with bases \(AB = 500\) and \(CD = 650\), and legs \(AD = BC = 333\), we start by finding the height of the trapezoid. Let the height be \(h\). If we drop perpendiculars from points \(A\) and \(B\) to line \(CD\), they will meet \(CD\) at points \(E\) and \(F\) respectively, such that \(AE\) and \(BF\) are the heights of the trapezoid. Since \(AB = EF = 500\), the segments \(DE\) and \(CF\) are equal and their sum is \(CD - AB = 650 - 500 = 150\). Therefore, each of these segments is \(75\).

Now, consider the right triangle \(ADE\). By the Pythagorean theorem, we have:
\[
AD^2 = AE^2 + DE^2 \implies 333^2 = h^2 + 75^2 \implies 110889 = h^2 + 5625 \implies h^2 = 105264 \implies h = \sqrt{105264} = 324.
\]

Next, we need to find the coordinates of points \(P\) and \(Q\). The angle bisectors of \(\angle A\) and \(\angle D\) meet at point \(P\), and the angle bisectors of \(\angle B\) and \(\angle C\) meet at point \(Q\). In an isosceles trapezoid, the intersection of the angle bisectors of the non-parallel sides lies on the line segment joining the midpoints of the bases. The distance between the midpoints of the bases is the height of the trapezoid, which is \(324\).

Since \(P\) and \(Q\) are the intersections of the angle bisectors of the trapezoid, they are collinear with the midpoints of the bases and lie on the line segment joining these midpoints. The distance \(PQ\) is the same as the distance between the midpoints of the bases, which is the height of the trapezoid. Therefore, the length of \(PQ\) is:
\[
PQ = 324.
\]

Thus, the answer is:
\[
\boxed{324}.
\]
