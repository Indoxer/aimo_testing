 The problem: 
For any finite set $X$, let $| X |$ denote the number of elements in $X$. Define
\[S_n = \sum | A \cap B | ,\]
where the sum is taken over all ordered pairs $(A, B)$ such that $A$ and $B$ are subsets of $\left\{ 1 , 2 , 3,  \cdots , n \right\}$ with $|A| = |B|$.
For example, $S_2 = 4$ because the sum is taken over the pairs of subsets
\[(A, B) \in \left\{ (\emptyset, \emptyset) , ( \{1\} , \{1\} ), ( \{1\} , \{2\} ) , ( \{2\} , \{1\} ) , ( \{2\} , \{2\} ) , ( \{1 , 2\} , \{1 , 2\} ) \right\} ,\]
giving $S_2 = 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 2 = 4$.
Let $\frac{S_{2022}}{S_{2021}} = \frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find the remainder when $p + q$ is divided by
1000.


To solve for \( S_n \), we need to understand the sum of the sizes of the intersections of all pairs of subsets of \(\{1, 2, \ldots, n\}\) of the same size. Let's start by considering the contribution of each element \( i \) in the set \(\{1, 2, \ldots, n\}\) to the sum \( S_n \).

For a fixed element \( i \), we need to count how many times \( i \) appears in the intersection of two subsets \( A \) and \( B \) of size \( k \). This happens if and only if both \( A \) and \( B \) contain \( i \). The number of ways to choose the remaining \( k-1 \) elements for \( A \) from the remaining \( n-1 \) elements is \(\binom{n-1}{k-1}\), and similarly for \( B \). Therefore, the number of pairs \((A, B)\) such that \( i \in A \cap B \) is \(\binom{n-1}{k-1}^2\).

Since there are \( \binom{n}{k} \) subsets of size \( k \), the total contribution of element \( i \) to \( S_n \) is \( \binom{n-1}{k-1}^2 \cdot \binom{n}{k} \). Summing this over all possible \( k \) from 0 to \( n \), we get:
\[
S_n = \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k} \binom{n-1}{k-1}^2.
\]

We can simplify this expression using the identity \(\binom{n}{k} = \binom{n}{n-k}\). Notice that:
\[
\binom{n}{k} = \binom{n}{n-k} \quad \text{and} \quad \binom{n-1}{k-1} = \binom{n-1}{n-k}.
\]
Thus, we can rewrite the sum as:
\[
S_n = \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k} \binom{n-1}{n-k}^2.
\]

Using the identity \(\sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k} \binom{n-1}{k} \binom{n-1}{n-k} = \binom{2(n-1)}{n}\), we get:
\[
S_n = \binom{2(n-1)}{n}.
\]

Now, we need to find \( S_{2022} \) and \( S_{2021} \):
\[
S_{2022} = \binom{4042}{2022}, \quad S_{2021} = \binom{4040}{2021}.
\]

The ratio \(\frac{S_{2022}}{S_{2021}}\) is:
\[
\frac{S_{2022}}{S_{2021}} = \frac{\binom{4042}{2022}}{\binom{4040}{2021}} = \frac{4042! / (2022! \cdot 2020!)}{4040! / (2021! \cdot 2019!)} = \frac{4042 \cdot 4041}{2022 \cdot 2021} = 2.
\]

Thus, \(\frac{S_{2022}}{S_{2021}} = 2\), and we have \( p = 2 \) and \( q = 1 \). Therefore, \( p + q = 3 \), and the remainder when \( p + q \) is divided by 1000 is:
\[
\boxed{3}.
\]
