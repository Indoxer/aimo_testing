 The problem: 
For any finite set $X$, let $| X |$ denote the number of elements in $X$. Define
\[S_n = \sum | A \cap B | ,\]
where the sum is taken over all ordered pairs $(A, B)$ such that $A$ and $B$ are subsets of $\left\{ 1 , 2 , 3,  \cdots , n \right\}$ with $|A| = |B|$.
For example, $S_2 = 4$ because the sum is taken over the pairs of subsets
\[(A, B) \in \left\{ (\emptyset, \emptyset) , ( \{1\} , \{1\} ), ( \{1\} , \{2\} ) , ( \{2\} , \{1\} ) , ( \{2\} , \{2\} ) , ( \{1 , 2\} , \{1 , 2\} ) \right\} ,\]
giving $S_2 = 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 2 = 4$.
Let $\frac{S_{2022}}{S_{2021}} = \frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find the remainder when $p + q$ is divided by
1000.


To solve for \( S_n \), we need to understand the sum of the sizes of the intersections of all ordered pairs of subsets of \(\{1, 2, \ldots, n\}\) with the same size. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, consider the number of ways to choose two subsets \(A\) and \(B\) of \(\{1, 2, \ldots, n\}\) such that \(|A| = |B| = k\). The number of ways to choose such subsets is given by \(\binom{n}{k}^2\), because we choose \(k\) elements out of \(n\) for both \(A\) and \(B\).

For each pair \((A, B)\), the size of the intersection \(|A \cap B|\) is the number of elements in the intersection of \(A\) and \(B\). We need to sum \(|A \cap B|\) over all such pairs. To do this, we count how many times each element \(i\) of \(\{1, 2, \ldots, n\}\) appears in the intersection \(A \cap B\).

An element \(i\) appears in \(A\) in \(\binom{n-1}{k-1}\) ways (choosing the remaining \(k-1\) elements from the other \(n-1\) elements), and similarly, it appears in \(B\) in \(\binom{n-1}{k-1}\) ways. Therefore, the probability that \(i\) is in both \(A\) and \(B\) is \(\left(\frac{k}{n}\right)^2\). Since there are \(n\) elements, the expected number of elements in the intersection \(A \cap B\) is \(n \cdot \left(\frac{k}{n}\right)^2 = \frac{k^2}{n}\).

Thus, the total sum \(S_n\) is:
\[
S_n = \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k}^2 \cdot \frac{k^2}{n}.
\]

We can simplify this expression by noting that \(\sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k}^2 = \binom{2n}{n}\) (by the Vandermonde identity), and that the sum of \(k^2\) over all \(k\) from 0 to \(n\) is \(\sum_{k=0}^n k^2 \binom{n}{k}^2 = n(n-1)2^{2n-2} + n2^{2n-1}\) (which can be derived using generating functions or combinatorial arguments).

However, a simpler approach is to use the known result that \(S_n = \binom{2n}{n} \cdot \frac{n(n+1)}{4}\). This result can be derived by considering the contribution of each element to the sum of intersections.

Using this, we have:
\[
S_{2022} = \binom{4044}{2022} \cdot \frac{2022 \cdot 2023}{4},
\]
\[
S_{2021} = \binom{4042}{2021} \cdot \frac{2021 \cdot 2022}{4}.
\]

The ratio \(\frac{S_{2022}}{S_{2021}}\) simplifies to:
\[
\frac{S_{2022}}{S_{2021}} = \frac{\binom{4044}{2022} \cdot \frac{2022 \cdot 2023}{4}}{\binom{4042}{2021} \cdot \frac{2021 \cdot 2022}{4}} = \frac{\binom{4044}{2022}}{\binom{4042}{2021}} \cdot \frac{2023}{2021}.
\]

Using the identity \(\binom{4044}{2022} = \frac{4044!}{2022! \cdot 2022!}\) and \(\binom{4042}{2021} = \frac{4042!}{2021! \cdot 2021!}\), we get:
\[
\frac{\binom{4044}{2022}}{\binom{4042}{2021}} = \frac{4044 \cdot 4043}{2022 \cdot 2021}.
\]

Thus,
\[
\frac{S_{2022}}{S_{2021}} = \frac{4044 \cdot 4043}{2022 \cdot 2021} \cdot \frac{2023}{2021} = \frac{4044 \cdot 4043 \cdot 2023}{2022 \cdot 2021^2}.
\]

Simplifying the fraction, we get:
\[
\frac{S_{2022}}{S_{2021}} = \frac{4044 \cdot 4043 \cdot 2023}{2022 \cdot 2021^2} = \frac{2 \cdot 4043 \cdot 2023}{2021^2} = \frac{8172 \cdot 2023}{2021^2}.
\]

Since 8172 and 2021 are coprime, the fraction is already in its simplest form. Therefore, \(p = 8172 \cdot 2023\) and \(q = 2021^2\), and we need to find the remainder when \(p + q\) is divided by 1000.

Calculating \(p + q \mod 1000\):
\[
8172 \equiv 172 \pmod{1000}, \quad 2023 \equiv 23 \pmod{1000}, \quad 2021^2 \equiv 21^2 = 441 \pmod{1000}.
\]
\[
p + q \equiv 172 \cdot 23 + 441 \pmod{1000} = 3956 + 441 = 4397 \equiv 397 \pmod{1000}.
\]

Thus, the remainder when \(p + q\) is divided by 1000 is \(\boxed{397}\).
