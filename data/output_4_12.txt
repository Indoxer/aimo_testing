 The problem: 
Let $S$ be the set of all rational numbers that can be expressed as a repeating decimal in the form $0.\overline{abcd},$ where at least one of the digits $a,$ $b,$ $c,$ or $d$ is nonzero. Let $N$ be the number of distinct numerators obtained when numbers in $S$ are written as fractions in lowest terms. For example, both $4$ and $410$ are counted among the distinct numerators for numbers in $S$ because $0.\overline{3636} = \frac{4}{11}$ and $0.\overline{1230} = \frac{410}{3333}.$ Find the remainder when $N$ is divided by $1000.$


To solve the problem, we first need to understand the structure of the repeating decimals in the set \( S \). A repeating decimal of the form \( 0.\overline{abcd} \) can be expressed as a fraction. Specifically, if we let \( x = 0.\overline{abcd} \), then we have:
\[ x = \frac{abcd}{9999}, \]
where \( abcd \) represents the four-digit number formed by the digits \( a, b, c, \) and \( d \). This fraction can be simplified to its lowest terms by dividing the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor (gcd).

The key is to determine how many distinct numerators we get when these fractions are in their simplest form. The denominator 9999 factors as:
\[ 9999 = 3^2 \times 11 \times 101. \]
For the fraction \( \frac{abcd}{9999} \) to be in its lowest terms, the numerator \( abcd \) must not share any prime factors with 9999, i.e., \( abcd \) must not be divisible by 3, 11, or 101.

We need to count the number of four-digit numbers that are not divisible by 3, 11, or 101. First, we calculate the total number of four-digit numbers, which is 9000 (from 1000 to 9999). We then use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find the number of four-digit numbers that are divisible by 3, 11, or 101.

The number of four-digit multiples of 3 is:
\[ \left\lfloor \frac{9999}{3} \right\rfloor - \left\lfloor \frac{999}{3} \right\rfloor = 3333 - 333 = 3000. \]
The number of four-digit multiples of 11 is:
\[ \left\lfloor \frac{9999}{11} \right\rfloor - \left\lfloor \frac{999}{11} \right\rfloor = 909 - 90 = 819. \]
The number of four-digit multiples of 101 is:
\[ \left\lfloor \frac{9999}{101} \right\rfloor - \left\lfloor \frac{999}{101} \right\rfloor = 99 - 9 = 90. \]
The number of four-digit multiples of 33 (3*11) is:
\[ \left\lfloor \frac{9999}{33} \right\rfloor - \left\lfloor \frac{999}{33} \right\rfloor = 303 - 30 = 273. \]
The number of four-digit multiples of 333 (3*101) is:
\[ \left\lfloor \frac{9999}{333} \right\rfloor - \left\lfloor \frac{999}{333} \right\rfloor = 30 - 3 = 27. \]
The number of four-digit multiples of 1111 (11*101) is:
\[ \left\lfloor \frac{9999}{1111} \right\rfloor - \left\lfloor \frac{999}{1111} \right\rfloor = 9 - 0 = 9. \]

Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, the number of four-digit numbers divisible by 3, 11, or 101 is:
\[ 3000 + 819 + 90 - 273 - 27 - 9 + 9 = 3599. \]
Therefore, the number of four-digit numbers not divisible by 3, 11, or 101 is:
\[ 9000 - 3599 = 5401. \]
Thus, the number of distinct numerators is 5401. The remainder when 5401 is divided by 1000 is:
\[ \boxed{401}. \]
