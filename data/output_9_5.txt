 The problem: 
Let $w = \dfrac{\sqrt{3} + i}{2}$ and $z = \dfrac{-1 + i\sqrt{3}}{2},$ where $i = \sqrt{-1}.$ Find the number of ordered pairs $(r,s)$ of positive integers not exceeding $100$ that satisfy the equation $i \cdot w^r = z^s.$


To solve the problem, we start by expressing \( w \) and \( z \) in polar form. Notice that both \( w \) and \( z \) are complex numbers on the unit circle in the complex plane.

First, consider \( w = \frac{\sqrt{3} + i}{2} \). This can be written as:
\[ w = \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{6}\right) + i \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{6}\right) = e^{i\pi/6}. \]

Next, consider \( z = \frac{-1 + i\sqrt{3}}{2} \). This can be written as:
\[ z = \cos\left(\frac{2\pi}{3}\right) + i \sin\left(\frac{2\pi}{3}\right) = e^{i2\pi/3}. \]

We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((r, s)\) of positive integers not exceeding 100 that satisfy the equation:
\[ i \cdot w^r = z^s. \]

Substituting the polar forms of \( w \) and \( z \), we get:
\[ i \cdot e^{i\pi/6 \cdot r} = e^{i2\pi s/3}. \]

Since \( i = e^{i\pi/2} \), we can rewrite the equation as:
\[ e^{i\pi/2} \cdot e^{i\pi/6 \cdot r} = e^{i2\pi s/3}, \]
which simplifies to:
\[ e^{i(\pi/2 + \pi r/6)} = e^{i2\pi s/3}. \]

This implies that the exponents must differ by an integer multiple of \( 2\pi \):
\[ \frac{\pi}{2} + \frac{\pi r}{6} = \frac{2\pi s}{3} + 2k\pi \]
for some integer \( k \). Dividing through by \( \pi \), we get:
\[ \frac{1}{2} + \frac{r}{6} = \frac{2s}{3} + 2k. \]
Multiplying through by 6, we obtain:
\[ 3 + r = 4s + 12k. \]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[ r = 4s + 12k - 3. \]

Since \( r \) and \( s \) are positive integers not exceeding 100, we need to find the range of \( s \) such that \( r \) is also a positive integer not exceeding 100. This means:
\[ 1 \leq 4s + 12k - 3 \leq 100. \]
Adding 3 to all parts of the inequality, we get:
\[ 4 \leq 4s + 12k \leq 103. \]
Dividing through by 4, we get:
\[ 1 \leq s + 3k \leq 25.75. \]
Since \( s \) and \( k \) are integers, we have:
\[ 1 \leq s + 3k \leq 25. \]

The smallest value of \( s \) is 1, and the largest value of \( s \) is 25. For each value of \( s \) from 1 to 25, \( k \) can take any integer value such that \( 1 \leq s + 3k \leq 25 \). This means \( k \) can range from 0 to \(\left\lfloor \frac{25 - s}{3} \right\rfloor\).

The number of possible values for \( k \) is:
\[ \left\lfloor \frac{25 - s}{3} \right\rfloor + 1. \]

Summing this over all possible values of \( s \) from 1 to 25, we get:
\[ \sum_{s=1}^{25} \left( \left\lfloor \frac{25 - s}{3} \right\rfloor + 1 \right). \]

We can break this sum into parts based on the value of \( \left\lfloor \frac{25 - s}{3} \right\rfloor \):
- For \( s = 1 \) to \( s = 2 \), \( \left\lfloor \frac{25 - s}{3} \right\rfloor = 8 \).
- For \( s = 3 \) to \( s = 5 \), \( \left\lfloor \frac{25 - s}{3} \right\rfloor = 7 \).
- For \( s = 6 \) to \( s = 8 \), \( \left\lfloor \frac{25 - s}{3} \right\rfloor = 6 \).
- For \( s = 9 \) to \( s = 11 \), \( \left\lfloor \frac{25 - s}{3} \right\rfloor = 5 \).
- For \( s = 12 \) to \( s = 14 \), \( \left\lfloor \frac{25 - s}{3} \right\rfloor = 4 \).
- For \( s = 15 \) to \( s = 17 \), \( \left\lfloor \frac{25 - s}{3} \right\rfloor = 3 \).
- For \( s = 18 \) to \( s = 20 \), \( \left\lfloor \frac{25 - s}{3} \right\rfloor = 2 \).
- For \( s = 21 \) to \( s = 23 \), \( \left\lfloor \frac{25 - s}{3} \right\rfloor = 1 \).
- For \( s = 24 \) to \( s = 25 \), \( \left\lfloor \frac{25 - s}{3} \right\rfloor = 0 \).

Summing these, we get:
\[ 2 \cdot 8 + 3 \cdot 7 + 3 \cdot 6 + 3 \cdot 5 + 3 \cdot 4 + 3 \cdot 3 + 3 \cdot 2 + 3 \cdot 1 + 2 \cdot 0 = 16 + 21 + 18 + 15 + 12 + 9 + 6 + 3 + 0 = 100. \]

Therefore, the number of ordered pairs \((r, s)\) is \(\boxed{100}\).
