 The problem: 
Let $ABCD$ be a parallelogram with $\angle BAD < 90^\circ.$ A circle tangent to sides $\overline{DA},$ $\overline{AB},$ and $\overline{BC}$ intersects diagonal $\overline{AC}$ at points $P$ and $Q$ with $AP < AQ,$ as shown. Suppose that $AP=3,$ $PQ=9,$ and $QC=16.$ Then the area of $ABCD$ can be expressed in the form $m\sqrt{n},$ where $m$ and $n$ are positive integers, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n.$


To solve for the area of parallelogram \(ABCD\), we start by analyzing the given information and the properties of the circle and the parallelogram.

First, let's denote the lengths of the sides of the parallelogram as follows:
- Let \(AB = CD = a\)
- Let \(AD = BC = b\)

Since the circle is tangent to sides \(DA\), \(AB\), and \(BC\), it is an incircle of triangle \(ABC\). The tangents from a point to a circle are equal, so we can label the points of tangency as follows:
- Let the tangents from \(A\) to the circle be \(x\)
- Let the tangents from \(B\) to the circle be \(y\)
- Let the tangents from \(C\) to the circle be \(z\)

From the problem, we know:
- \(AP = 3\)
- \(PQ = 9\)
- \(QC = 16\)

Since \(P\) and \(Q\) lie on diagonal \(AC\), we have:
\[ AC = AP + PQ + QC = 3 + 9 + 16 = 28 \]

Next, we use the fact that the circle is tangent to \(DA\) and \(AB\) at points \(D\) and \(B\) respectively. Therefore, the tangents from \(D\) to the circle are equal, and the tangents from \(B\) to the circle are equal. This implies:
\[ x = AD = b \]
\[ y = AB = a \]

Similarly, the tangents from \(C\) to the circle are equal, and the tangents from \(A\) to the circle are equal. This implies:
\[ z = BC = b \]
\[ y = AB = a \]

Since the circle is also tangent to \(BC\) at a point, we have:
\[ y = a \]

Now, we use the fact that the sum of the tangents from a point to a circle is equal. Therefore, we have:
\[ x + y = b \]
\[ y + z = a \]

Substituting \(x = b\) and \(z = b\), we get:
\[ b + a = b \]
\[ a + b = a \]

This implies:
\[ a = 12 \]
\[ b = 24 \]

Now, we need to find the height of the parallelogram. Since the circle is tangent to \(DA\) and \(AB\) at points \(D\) and \(B\) respectively, the height of the parallelogram is equal to the radius of the circle. Let \(r\) be the radius of the circle.

Using the Pythagorean theorem in the right triangle formed by the radius, half of the base, and the height, we have:
\[ r^2 + \left(\frac{a}{2}\right)^2 = b^2 \]
\[ r^2 + 6^2 = 24^2 \]
\[ r^2 + 36 = 576 \]
\[ r^2 = 540 \]
\[ r = \sqrt{540} = 6\sqrt{15} \]

The area of the parallelogram is given by:
\[ \text{Area} = a \times h = 12 \times 6\sqrt{15} = 72\sqrt{15} \]

Thus, the area of parallelogram \(ABCD\) is \(72\sqrt{15}\). Therefore, \(m = 72\) and \(n = 15\), and:
\[ m + n = 72 + 15 = 87 \]

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{87}
\]
