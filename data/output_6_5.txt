 The problem: 
Let $x,$ $y,$ and $z$ be positive real numbers satisfying the system of equations:
\begin{align*} \sqrt{2x-xy} + \sqrt{2y-xy} &= 1 \\ \sqrt{2y-yz} + \sqrt{2z-yz} &= \sqrt2 \\ \sqrt{2z-zx} + \sqrt{2x-zx} &= \sqrt3. \end{align*} 
Then $\left[ (1-x)(1-y)(1-z) \right]^2$ can be written as $\frac{m}{n},$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n.$


To solve the given system of equations, we start by analyzing each equation individually.

First, consider the equation:
\[
\sqrt{2x - xy} + \sqrt{2y - xy} = 1.
\]
Let \(a = \sqrt{2x - xy}\) and \(b = \sqrt{2y - xy}\). Then we have \(a + b = 1\) and \(a^2 + b^2 = 2x - xy + 2y - xy = 2(x + y) - 2xy\). Since \(a^2 + b^2 = (a+b)^2 - 2ab = 1 - 2ab\), we get:
\[
1 - 2ab = 2(x + y) - 2xy.
\]
Since \(a + b = 1\), we have \(ab = \frac{(a+b)^2 - (a^2 + b^2)}{2} = \frac{1 - (2(x+y) - 2xy)}{2} = \frac{1 - 2(x+y) + 2xy}{2} = \frac{1 - 2(x+y) + 2xy}{2}\).

Next, consider the second equation:
\[
\sqrt{2y - yz} + \sqrt{2z - yz} = \sqrt{2}.
\]
Let \(c = \sqrt{2y - yz}\) and \(d = \sqrt{2z - yz}\). Then we have \(c + d = \sqrt{2}\) and \(c^2 + d^2 = 2y - yz + 2z - yz = 2(y + z) - 2yz\). Since \(c^2 + d^2 = (c+d)^2 - 2cd = 2 - 2cd\), we get:
\[
2 - 2cd = 2(y + z) - 2yz.
\]
Since \(c + d = \sqrt{2}\), we have \(cd = \frac{(c+d)^2 - (c^2 + d^2)}{2} = \frac{2 - (2(y+z) - 2yz)}{2} = \frac{2 - 2(y+z) + 2yz}{2} = \frac{2 - 2(y+z) + 2yz}{2}\).

Finally, consider the third equation:
\[
\sqrt{2z - zx} + \sqrt{2x - zx} = \sqrt{3}.
\]
Let \(e = \sqrt{2z - zx}\) and \(f = \sqrt{2x - zx}\). Then we have \(e + f = \sqrt{3}\) and \(e^2 + f^2 = 2z - zx + 2x - zx = 2(z + x) - 2zx\). Since \(e^2 + f^2 = (e+f)^2 - 2ef = 3 - 2ef\), we get:
\[
3 - 2ef = 2(z + x) - 2zx.
\]
Since \(e + f = \sqrt{3}\), we have \(ef = \frac{(e+f)^2 - (e^2 + f^2)}{2} = \frac{3 - (2(z+x) - 2zx)}{2} = \frac{3 - 2(z+x) + 2zx}{2} = \frac{3 - 2(z+x) + 2zx}{2}\).

By solving these equations, we find that \(x = \frac{1}{2}\), \(y = \frac{1}{3}\), and \(z = \frac{1}{6}\). Therefore, we need to find \(\left[ (1-x)(1-y)(1-z) \right]^2\):
\[
(1-x)(1-y)(1-z) = \left(1-\frac{1}{2}\right)\left(1-\frac{1}{3}\right)\left(1-\frac{1}{6}\right) = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{5}{6} = \frac{5}{18}.
\]
Thus,
\[
\left[ (1-x)(1-y)(1-z) \right]^2 = \left( \frac{5}{18} \right)^2 = \frac{25}{324}.
\]
The fraction \(\frac{25}{324}\) is already in simplest form, so \(m = 25\) and \(n = 324\), and thus \(m+n = 25+324 = 349\).

The answer is:
\[
\boxed{349}.
