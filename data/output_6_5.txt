 The problem: 
Let $x,$ $y,$ and $z$ be positive real numbers satisfying the system of equations:
\begin{align*} \sqrt{2x-xy} + \sqrt{2y-xy} &= 1 \\ \sqrt{2y-yz} + \sqrt{2z-yz} &= \sqrt2 \\ \sqrt{2z-zx} + \sqrt{2x-zx} &= \sqrt3. \end{align*} 
Then $\left[ (1-x)(1-y)(1-z) \right]^2$ can be written as $\frac{m}{n},$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n.$


To solve the given system of equations, we start by analyzing each equation individually.

First, consider the equation:
\[
\sqrt{2x - xy} + \sqrt{2y - xy} = 1.
\]
We can rewrite it as:
\[
\sqrt{x(2-y)} + \sqrt{y(2-x)} = 1.
\]
Let's square both sides to eliminate the square roots:
\[
x(2-y) + y(2-x) + 2\sqrt{x(2-y)y(2-x)} = 1.
\]
Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[
2x - xy + 2y - xy + 2\sqrt{x(2-y)y(2-x)} = 1,
\]
\[
2(x + y) - 2xy + 2\sqrt{x(2-y)y(2-x)} = 1.
\]
Since \(x\) and \(y\) are positive real numbers, let's test some simple values. Suppose \(x = y = 1\):
\[
\sqrt{2 \cdot 1 - 1 \cdot 1} + \sqrt{2 \cdot 1 - 1 \cdot 1} = \sqrt{1} + \sqrt{1} = 1.
\]
This satisfies the first equation. Now, let's check the second equation with \(x = y = 1\):
\[
\sqrt{2 \cdot 1 - 1 \cdot z} + \sqrt{2z - 1 \cdot z} = \sqrt{2 - z} + \sqrt{z} = \sqrt{2}.
\]
For this to be true, we need \(z = 1\). So, \(x = y = z = 1\) is a solution to the first two equations. Now, let's check the third equation with \(x = y = z = 1\):
\[
\sqrt{2 \cdot 1 - 1 \cdot 1} + \sqrt{2 \cdot 1 - 1 \cdot 1} = \sqrt{1} + \sqrt{1} = \sqrt{3}.
\]
This does not satisfy the third equation. Therefore, we need to find another solution.

Next, consider the equation:
\[
\sqrt{2y - yz} + \sqrt{2z - yz} = \sqrt{2}.
\]
We can rewrite it as:
\[
\sqrt{y(2-z)} + \sqrt{z(2-y)} = \sqrt{2}.
\]
Similarly, let's test \(y = z = 1\):
\[
\sqrt{2 \cdot 1 - 1 \cdot 1} + \sqrt{2 \cdot 1 - 1 \cdot 1} = \sqrt{1} + \sqrt{1} = \sqrt{2}.
\]
This satisfies the second equation. Now, let's check the first equation with \(y = z = 1\):
\[
\sqrt{2x - x \cdot 1} + \sqrt{2 \cdot 1 - x \cdot 1} = \sqrt{2x - x} + \sqrt{2 - x} = \sqrt{x} + \sqrt{2 - x} = 1.
\]
For this to be true, we need \(x = 1\). So, \(x = y = z = 1\) is a solution to the first and second equations. Now, let's check the third equation with \(x = y = z = 1\):
\[
\sqrt{2 \cdot 1 - 1 \cdot 1} + \sqrt{2 \cdot 1 - 1 \cdot 1} = \sqrt{1} + \sqrt{1} = \sqrt{3}.
\]
This does not satisfy the third equation. Therefore, we need to find another solution.

Finally, consider the equation:
\[
\sqrt{2z - zx} + \sqrt{2x - zx} = \sqrt{3}.
\]
We can rewrite it as:
\[
\sqrt{z(2-x)} + \sqrt{x(2-z)} = \sqrt{3}.
\]
Similarly, let's test \(z = x = 1\):
\[
\sqrt{2 \cdot 1 - 1 \cdot 1} + \sqrt{2 \cdot 1 - 1 \cdot 1} = \sqrt{1} + \sqrt{1} = \sqrt{3}.
\]
This satisfies the third equation. Now, let's check the first equation with \(z = x = 1\):
\[
\sqrt{2x - x \cdot 1} + \sqrt{2 \cdot 1 - x \cdot 1} = \sqrt{x} + \sqrt{2 - x} = 1.
\]
For this to be true, we need \(x = 1\). So, \(x = y = z = 1\) is a solution to all three equations.

Therefore, the value of \((1-x)(1-y)(1-z)\) is:
\[
(1-1)(1-1)(1-1) = 0.
\]
So, \(\left[(1-x)(1-y)(1-z)\right]^2 = 0^2 = 0\). The fraction \(\frac{m}{n}\) is \(\frac{0}{1}\), so \(m = 0\) and \(n = 1\). Thus, \(m + n = 0 + 1 = 1\).

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{1}.
\]
