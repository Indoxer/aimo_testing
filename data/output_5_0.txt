 The problem: 
Given $\triangle ABC$ and a point $P$ on one of its sides, call line $\ell$ the $\textit{splitting line}$ of $\triangle ABC$ through $P$ if $\ell$ passes through $P$ and divides $\triangle ABC$ into two polygons of equal perimeter. Let $\triangle ABC$ be a triangle where $BC = 219$ and $AB$ and $AC$ are positive integers. Let $M$ and $N$ be the midpoints of $\overline{AB}$ and $\overline{AC},$ respectively, and suppose that the splitting lines of $\triangle ABC$ through $M$ and $N$ intersect at $30^\circ.$ Find the perimeter of $\triangle ABC.$


Alright, so I've got this geometry problem here about triangle ABC. Let me try to parse it step by step.

First, they mention BC is 219 units long, and AB and AC are positive integers. So, triangle ABC has sides AB, BC, and AC, with BC fixed at 219, and AB and AC being integers. That's a key piece of information because we might need to use integer constraints later on.

Then, M and N are the midpoints of AB and AC, respectively. So, M divides AB into two equal parts, and N divides AC into two equal parts. That makes sense. They also say that the splitting lines of triangle ABC through M and N intersect at 30 degrees. Hmm, okay, so each of these splitting lines passes through M or N, respectively, and splits the triangle into two regions with equal perimeters. These two splitting lines intersect at an angle of 30 degrees. Interesting.

Our goal is to find the perimeter of triangle ABC. Since BC is 219, and AB and AC are integers, we'll probably need to figure out their lengths such that when we construct the splitting lines through M and N, they meet at 30 degrees. Then, sum all sides for the perimeter.

Let me recall what a splitting line is. A splitting line through a point P on a side of a triangle is a line that passes through P and divides the triangle into two regions with equal perimeter. So, for point M on AB, the splitting line through M will pass through some point on another side (either AC or BC) such that the perimeters of the two resulting polygons are equal.

Similarly, the splitting line through N will pass through some other point on another side, creating two regions with equal perimeters.

So, first, maybe I should model this. Let's consider triangle ABC with points M and N as midpoints.

Wait, but how do we find the equations of these splitting lines? Maybe coordinate geometry could help here.

Yes, perhaps placing the triangle in a coordinate system would make things clearer. Let me assign coordinates to the triangle. Let's let point B be at (0,0), point C at (219,0). Then point A can be somewhere in the plane; let's say at (p,q).

Since M is the midpoint of AB, which is from (0,0) to (p,q), so M would be at ((p/2), (q/2)). Similarly, N is the midpoint of AC, so since C is at (219,0), N would be at ((p + 219)/2, q/2).

Now, we need to find the splitting lines through M and N. Each splitting line must split the triangle into two regions with equal perimeter. So, for the splitting line through M, we need to determine where it intersects another side so that the perimeters of the two resulting figures are equal.

Similarly for the splitting line through N.

But wait, splitting lines can sometimes be thought of as lines that balance the perimeters. Maybe I can set up equations based on perimeter conditions.

Let me think about the splitting line through M first. It goes through M and intersects either AC or BC. Wait, since M is on AB, the splitting line through M could intersect either AC or BC.

But since splitting lines divide the triangle into two polygons, each of those polygons must have half the perimeter. Wait, no—the definition says equal perimeter, not half the original perimeter. So, the perimeter of the two resulting polygons must be equal. But the original triangle's perimeter isn't necessarily even. Hmm, that complicates things.

Wait, let me clarify. The perimeter of the original triangle is AB + BC + AC. When you draw a splitting line through P, you're creating two polygons, each consisting of part of the original triangle's sides plus the splitting line itself. So, the perimeters of these two polygons must be equal.

Therefore, the sum of the lengths of the sides of the original triangle up to the intersection point, plus the length of the splitting line, must equal half of the total perimeter?

Wait, no, actually, more precisely, each polygon will consist of some sides of the original triangle and the splitting line. So, their perimeters will include portions of the original sides plus the splitting line.

So, let's formalize this.

Suppose we have a splitting line through M that intersects AC at some point D. Then, the two resulting polygons are quadrilateral ABMD and triangle DMC. Wait, no—if you connect M to D, then the two polygons are triangle AMB and quadrilateral MDAC? No, wait, hold on.

Wait, no—when you draw a line from M (on AB) to D (on AC), you split the triangle into two smaller triangles: triangle AM D and quadrilateral MDCB. Wait, actually, that's not correct either because both M and D are points on different sides.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think that splitting line through M divides the triangle into a smaller triangle and a quadrilateral. So, depending on where the splitting line intersects, one polygon will be a triangle, and the other will be a quadrilateral.

But in any case, both polygons must have equal perimeters.

So, for example, if the splitting line through M intersects AC at D, then the perimeter of triangle AMD must equal the perimeter of quadrilateral DMCB. Similarly, if the splitting line intersects BC at E, then the perimeter of triangle AME must equal the perimeter of quadrilateral EMBC.

Wait, but is that always the case? Or does it depend on whether the splitting line intersects another side?

Hmm, perhaps I need to define variables for the intersection points.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or property for splitting lines that can help us compute their direction or something else.

Wait, thinking back, splitting lines can sometimes be constructed using the concept of equalizing perimeters. Maybe there's a way to parameterize the point where the splitting line intersects another side so that the perimeters are equal.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use mass point geometry or similar concepts.

Wait, but since M and N are midpoints, maybe the splitting lines have some symmetric properties.

Wait, but given that the splitting lines through M and N intersect at 30 degrees, which is a specific angle, perhaps we can relate the slopes of these splitting lines to get an equation involving the sides AB and AC.

This seems a bit abstract. Let me try to approach it step by step.

First, let's denote:

- Let’s let AB = c, AC = b, and BC = a = 219.

We know that a, b, c are sides opposite angles A, B, C respectively. But in standard notation, usually, a is BC, b is AC, c is AB.

Given that, then:

Perimeter P = a + b + c = 219 + b + c.

We need to find b and c such that the splitting lines through M and N intersect at 30 degrees, and M and N are midpoints.

So, M is the midpoint of AB, so AM = MB = c/2.

Similarly, N is the midpoint of AC, so AN = NC = b/2.

So, the splitting lines through M and N.

Let me try to parametrize the splitting line through M.

Let’s assume that the splitting line through M intersects AC at some point D. Then, the perimeter of triangle AMD must equal the perimeter of quadrilateral DMCB.

So, perimeter of AMD: AM + MD + DA.

Perimeter of DMCB: DM + MC + CB + BD.

Wait, but actually, if you split along MD, the two figures are triangle AMD and quadrilateral DMCB.

But the perimeter of AMD is AM + MD + DA.

The perimeter of DMCB is DM + MC + CB + BD.

Wait, but is that right? Because when you split the triangle along MD, the two perimeters include the splitting line MD and parts of the original triangle's sides.

So, perimeter of AMD is AM + MD + DA.

Perimeter of DMCB is DM + MC + CB + BD.

But since both perimeters must be equal, we have:

AM + MD + DA = DM + MC + CB + BD

Simplify: AM - DM = MC + CB + BD - MD - DA

Wait, this seems messy. Maybe there's a better way.

Alternatively, perhaps the sum of the perimeters of the two resulting polygons is equal to the perimeter of the original triangle plus twice the length of the splitting line.

But since we want them equal, each must be half of the total perimeter minus the splitting line? Wait, no, not exactly.

Wait, perhaps it's better to write the perimeters.

Let me denote:

After splitting along MD, the two perimeters are:

Perimeter of AMD: AM + MD + DA

Perimeter of DMCB: DM + MC + CB + BD

Since these must be equal,

AM + MD + DA = DM + MC + CB + BD

Subtracting DM from both sides,

AM + DA = MC + CB + BD

But AM = c/2, DA = x (let me denote DA = x), so left side is c/2 + x.

Right side: MC is the remaining part of AC after D, so if AC = b, then MC = b - x.

CB is 219, BD is the remaining part of BC after D? Wait, no, BD is along AB? Wait, no, point D is on AC, so BD is not a side.

Wait, hold on. If the splitting line is MD, connecting M on AB to D on AC, then in the quadrilateral DMCB, the sides would be DM, MC, CB, and BD. Wait, BD isn't a side of the original triangle—it's a segment from B to D, but D is on AC.

Wait, no, actually, BD is not a side, but rather, the sides of the quadrilateral are DM, MC, CB, and BD. But BD is a new segment inside the triangle.

Wait, now I'm confused. Maybe my initial assumption is wrong about what the two perimeters are.

Wait, perhaps I need to rethink this.

When we draw a line from M to D on AC, the two resulting figures are triangle AMD and triangle DMB? No, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, no, if you draw a line from M on AB to D on AC, the two resulting figures are triangle AMD and quadrilateral DMB... Hmm, perhaps it's triangle AMD and quadrilateral DMCB.

But then, in the quadrilateral DMCB, the sides are DC, CM, MB, and BD? No, I'm getting tangled up.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to note that the perimeter of triangle AMD is AM + MD + DA.

The perimeter of the other part, which is quadrilateral DMCB, is DM + MC + CB + BD.

Wait, but BD is not a side of the original triangle. It's a segment from B to D, where D is on AC.

Therefore, in terms of the original triangle's sides, the perimeters would include MD (the splitting line) and segments along the original sides.

So, perimeter of AMD: AM + MD + DA.

Perimeter of DMCB: DM + MC + CB + BD.

But BD is a new segment, not part of the original perimeter.

Wait, this suggests that the perimeter of DMCB includes BD, which is not part of the original triangle's perimeter, so perhaps my initial idea is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the perimeters are meant to include the outer edges only? So, the perimeter of the two resulting polygons would be the sum of their outer edges, which include parts of the original triangle and the splitting line.

In that case, for triangle AMD, the perimeter would be AM + MD + DA.

For the quadrilateral DMCB, the perimeter would be DM + MC + CB + BD, but BD is not a side of the original triangle, so maybe it's considered as just the boundary from D to B, which is not part of the original perimeter.

Wait, I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, maybe the perimeters refer to the sum of all edges, including the splitting line.

So, for triangle AMD, the perimeter is AM + MD + DA.

For quadrilateral DMCB, the perimeter is DM + MC + CB + BD.

But BD is not a side of the original triangle, so perhaps it's included as part of the perimeter.

But in that case, the perimeters would be:

Perimeter of AMD: c/2 + MD + x

Perimeter of DMCB: MD + (b - x) + 219 + y

Where y is the length from D to B? Wait, but D is on AC, so how does it connect to B?

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Perhaps instead, I should use the fact that the perimeters must be equal, so:

c/2 + MD + x = MD + (b - x) + 219 + y

But I don't know what y is. Alternatively, perhaps I can express y in terms of x using triangle similarity or something else.

Wait, perhaps if I can relate the lengths using coordinates.

Earlier, I placed B at (0,0), C at (219,0), and A at (p,q). Then, M is at (p/2, q/2), and D is a point on AC.

Parametrize AC: from A(p,q) to C(219,0). So, any point D on AC can be expressed as D = ( (1 - t)p + t*219, (1 - t)q + t*0 ) = ( p + t(219 - p), q(1 - t) ), where t is between 0 and 1.

Similarly, the line MD connects M(p/2, q/2) to D(p + t(219 - p), q(1 - t)).

So, the equation of line MD can be found, and perhaps we can find the value of t such that the perimeters are equal.

But this seems quite involved. Let me see if I can find a relationship.

Let’s denote t as the fraction along AC from A to C. So, when t=0, D is at A, and t=1, D is at C.

So, the length AD = t * AC = t*b, and DC = (1 - t)*b.

Similarly, the perimeter condition would be:

Perimeter of AMD = Perimeter of DMCB

Which translates to:

AM + MD + DA = DM + MC + CB + BD

Wait, but again, BD is a bit tricky because it's a segment from B to D, which is not along the original triangle.

Wait, perhaps instead of trying to compute perimeters directly, I can use vector methods or coordinate geometry to find the perimeters.

So, let's proceed with coordinates.

Point A is at (p, q), so AB is from (0,0) to (p,q), and AC is from (p,q) to (219,0).

Midpoint M is at (p/2, q/2). Midpoint N is at ( (p + 219)/2, q/2 ).

We need to find splitting lines through M and N.

Let me tackle the splitting line through M first.

Assume the splitting line through M intersects AC at D. Let's parameterize D as above.

Coordinates of D: (p + t(219 - p), q(1 - t)).

So, the line MD connects M(p/2, q/2) to D(p + t(219 - p), q(1 - t)).

Let me compute the distance MD.

Distance between M and D:

MD^2 = [ (p + t(219 - p) - p/2)^2 + (q(1 - t) - q/2)^2 ]

Simplify:

x-coordinate difference: p + t(219 - p) - p/2 = p/2 + t(219 - p)

y-coordinate difference: q(1 - t) - q/2 = q(1/2 - t)

Thus,

MD^2 = [ p/2 + t(219 - p) ]^2 + [ q(1/2 - t) ]^2

Similarly, DA is the length from D to A.

DA = sqrt[ (p - (p + t(219 - p)))^2 + (q - q(1 - t))^2 ]

Simplify:

x-coordinate difference: -t(219 - p)

y-coordinate difference: qt

Thus,

DA^2 = [ t(219 - p) ]^2 + [ qt ]^2 = t^2 ( (219 - p)^2 + q^2 )

Similarly, perimeter of AMD is AM + MD + DA.

AM is c/2, since M is the midpoint.

Wait, hold on: AB is from (0,0) to (p,q), so AB length is c = sqrt(p^2 + q^2).

Similarly, AC is from (p,q) to (219,0), so AC length is b = sqrt( (219 - p)^2 + q^2 )

Therefore, AM = c/2, DA = t * b.

So, perimeter of AMD is:

AM + MD + DA = c/2 + sqrt( [ p/2 + t(219 - p) ]^2 + [ q(1/2 - t) ]^2 ) + t*b

Similarly, perimeter of DMCB.

Quadrilateral DMCB consists of points D, M, C, B.

Wait, D is on AC, M is on AB, so connecting D-M-C-B-D.

So, the sides are DM, MC, CB, and BD.

Wait, BD is from B(0,0) to D(p + t(219 - p), q(1 - t)).

So, BD length is sqrt( [p + t(219 - p)]^2 + [q(1 - t)]^2 )

Similarly, MC is the length from M to C.

M is at (p/2, q/2), C is at (219, 0). So,

MC^2 = (219 - p/2)^2 + (0 - q/2)^2 = (219 - p/2)^2 + (q/2)^2

And CB is 219.

So, perimeter of DMCB is:

DM + MC + CB + BD

Which is:

sqrt( [ p/2 + t(219 - p) ]^2 + [ q(1/2 - t) ]^2 ) + sqrt( (219 - p/2)^2 + (q/2)^2 ) + 219 + sqrt( [p + t(219 - p)]^2 + [q(1 - t)]^2 )

That's complicated. So, setting perimeters equal:

c/2 + sqrt( [ p/2 + t(219 - p) ]^2 + [ q(1/2 - t) ]^2 ) + t*b = sqrt( [ p/2 + t(219 - p) ]^2 + [ q(1/2 - t) ]^2 ) + sqrt( (219 - p/2)^2 + (q/2)^2 ) + 219 + sqrt( [p + t(219 - p)]^2 + [q(1 - t)]^2 )

Wow, that's a mouthful. Let me try to simplify.

First, notice that sqrt( [ p/2 + t(219 - p) ]^2 + [ q(1/2 - t) ]^2 ) appears on both sides, so we can subtract that term from both sides.

Thus, we have:

c/2 + t*b = sqrt( (219 - p/2)^2 + (q/2)^2 ) + 219 + sqrt( [p + t(219 - p)]^2 + [q(1 - t)]^2 )

Okay, so that's a bit simpler.

Now, let's denote s = sqrt( (219 - p/2)^2 + (q/2)^2 ). That's the length of MC.

So, we have:

c/2 + t*b = s + 219 + sqrt( [p + t(219 - p)]^2 + [q(1 - t)]^2 )

Let me rearrange:

sqrt( [p + t(219 - p)]^2 + [q(1 - t)]^2 ) = c/2 + t*b - s - 219

Hmm, this is still complex.

Alternatively, perhaps I can square both sides to eliminate the square roots.

But before doing that, let me note that c = sqrt(p^2 + q^2), b = sqrt( (219 - p)^2 + q^2 ), s is defined as above.

Let me also note that p^2 + q^2 = c^2, and (219 - p)^2 + q^2 = b^2.

So, expanding [p + t(219 - p)]^2 + [q(1 - t)]^2:

= p^2 + 2pt(219 - p) + t^2(219 - p)^2 + q^2(1 - t)^2

= (p^2 + q^2) + 2pt(219 - p) + t^2(219 - p)^2 + q^2(1 - 2t + t^2)

= c^2 + 2pt(219 - p) + t^2(219 - p)^2 + q^2 - 2t q^2 + t^2 q^2

But since c^2 = p^2 + q^2, so substitute:

= c^2 + 2pt(219 - p) + t^2(219 - p)^2 + (c^2 - p^2) - 2t(c^2 - p^2)^(1/2 ?) Wait, no, q^2 is just (q)^2, which is same as c^2 - p^2.

Wait, no, q^2 = c^2 - p^2. So, yes, substituting:

= c^2 + 2pt(219 - p) + t^2(219 - p)^2 + (c^2 - p^2) - 2t(c^2 - p^2) + t^2(c^2 - p^2)

Wait, but this seems messy. Perhaps a different approach is needed.

Alternatively, perhaps instead of going through coordinates, I can use ratios.

Because M is the midpoint of AB, so AM = MB = c/2.

If the splitting line through M meets AC at D, then the ratio AD/DC can be determined by the perimeter condition.

Similarly, perhaps using the concept that the splitting line divides the perimeter in some proportion.

Wait, I remember that in a triangle, a line drawn from a vertex that divides the opposite side in the ratio of the adjacent sides relates to equal perimeters.

Is that applicable here?

Wait, more precisely, if a line is drawn from a point on one side such that the ratio of the segments is equal to the ratio of the other two sides, then the perimeter is divided equally.

But in our case, the splitting line isn't from a vertex, but from a midpoint. So, maybe a similar concept applies.

Wait, suppose in triangle ABC, a line is drawn from M (midpoint of AB) to D on AC such that AD/DC = AB/BC.

Would that ensure equal perimeters?

Let me check.

AD/DC = AB/BC => AD/DC = c/a

Then, perimeter of AMD would be AM + MD + AD = c/2 + MD + (c/(a + c)) * b

Similarly, perimeter of DMCB would be DM + MC + CB + BD = MD + (a + c - c/(a + c) * b ) + a + BD

Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can look up the formula for equal perimeter division.

Wait, upon reflection, I recall that for a line to split the perimeter equally, the ratio of the segments on the opposite side is proportional to the ratio of the adjacent sides.

Specifically, if a line from a point on side AB divides AB into segments with ratio k:1, then it divides the opposite side AC into segments proportional to k times the ratio of the other sides.

Wait, perhaps it's better to refer to the formula.

Wait, according to some sources, if a line is drawn from a point dividing one side of a triangle in the ratio m:n, then the line will divide the opposite side in the ratio related to the other sides.

But I might be misremembering.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the concept of similar triangles or area ratios.

But maybe that's not directly helpful here.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the fact that since M is the midpoint, the splitting line through M must satisfy certain properties.

Wait, let me think about the perimeter condition.

Suppose the splitting line through M intersects AC at D.

Then, the perimeter of triangle AMD is equal to the perimeter of quadrilateral DMCB.

So,

Perimeter(AMD) = AM + MD + DA = c/2 + MD + DA

Perimeter(DMCB) = DM + MC + CB + BD = MD + (b - DA) + 219 + BD

Setting equal:

c/2 + MD + DA = MD + (b - DA) + 219 + BD

Simplify:

c/2 + DA = b - DA + 219 + BD

Bring like terms together:

c/2 + DA + DA = b + 219 + BD

c/2 + 2 DA = b + 219 + BD

But BD is a segment from B to D on AC.

Wait, how can we express BD in terms of known quantities?

Using coordinates, BD can be expressed as sqrt( (p + t(219 - p))^2 + (q(1 - t))^2 )

But this is getting too complex.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use vectors or trigonometry.

Wait, considering triangle ABC with AB = c, AC = b, BC = 219.

Let me denote angle at B as angle B, and angle at C as angle C.

Wait, using the Law of Cosines, perhaps.

But without knowing the angles, it's difficult.

Wait, but if we denote coordinates, maybe it's manageable.

Wait, earlier, I set coordinates as follows:

- B(0,0), C(219,0), A(p,q)

Then, AB = c = sqrt(p^2 + q^2)

AC = b = sqrt( (219 - p)^2 + q^2 )

Midpoints:

M(p/2, q/2), N( (p + 219)/2, q/2 )

Splitting line through M intersects AC at D(t) = (p + t(219 - p), q(1 - t)) for t in [0,1]

Similarly, splitting line through N intersects AB or BC at some point.

But this is getting too involved.

Wait, perhaps it's better to switch approaches.

Let me consider that the splitting lines through M and N are such that they form equal perimeters.

Moreover, the angle between them is 30 degrees.

So, if I can find the equations of the splitting lines through M and N, find the angle between them, set it to 30 degrees, and solve for b and c.

But how?

Wait, perhaps using vectors or coordinate geometry.

Wait, let me try to model the splitting lines through M and N.

Given that M is the midpoint of AB, and N is the midpoint of AC.

From point M, the splitting line goes to some point on AC, say D.

Similarly, from N, the splitting line goes to some point on AB, say E.

But perhaps they go to other sides, not necessarily the ones I thought.

Wait, perhaps for the splitting line through M, it can intersect BC instead of AC.

Depending on the shape of the triangle, the splitting line might intersect a different side.

So, perhaps the splitting line through M could intersect BC at some point F, instead of AC.

Similarly, the splitting line through N could intersect AB or BC.

Wait, so it's possible that the splitting lines through M and N intersect BC.

Therefore, it's necessary to determine whether the splitting lines through M and N intersect AC or BC.

To figure this out, perhaps we can consider specific cases.

But since the problem mentions that the splitting lines intersect at 30 degrees, it's likely that both splitting lines intersect BC, hence creating two different lines intersecting BC at some points, and the angle between them is 30 degrees.

Therefore, perhaps I should model both splitting lines as lines from M and N intersecting BC.

So, let me suppose that the splitting line through M intersects BC at F, and the splitting line through N intersects BC at G.

Then, the two splitting lines MF and NG intersect at some point, say P, and angle FPG is 30 degrees.

Wait, but the problem states that the splitting lines through M and N intersect at 30 degrees. So, perhaps they intersect each other at 30 degrees.

Hence, the angle between MF and NG is 30 degrees.

So, if I can find the equations of MF and NG, then compute the angle between them, set it to 30 degrees, and solve for the sides.

Okay, so let's proceed.

First, let's find the coordinates of F and G, the points where the splitting lines through M and N intersect BC.

So, starting with splitting line through M.

Point M is (p/2, q/2). The splitting line through M must intersect BC at some point F.

Since BC is from (0,0) to (219,0), it's along the x-axis.

So, point F is (f, 0), where f is between 0 and 219.

Similarly, splitting line through N intersects BC at point G(g, 0).

Now, we can write the equations of MF and NG.

Equation of MF: passes through M(p/2, q/2) and F(f, 0).

Slope of MF: (0 - q/2)/(f - p/2) = (-q/2)/(f - p/2)

Similarly, equation of NG: passes through N( (p + 219)/2, q/2 ) and G(g, 0).

Slope of NG: (0 - q/2)/(g - (p + 219)/2 ) = (-q/2)/(g - (p + 219)/2 )

Now, once we have the slopes, we can find the angle between MF and NG.

The tangent of the angle between two lines with slopes m1 and m2 is |(m2 - m1)/(1 + m1*m2)|.

Set this equal to tan(30°) = 1/√3.

Therefore,

|(m2 - m1)/(1 + m1*m2)| = 1/√3

So, plug in the expressions for m1 and m2.

But before that, we need to find f and g such that the perimeters of the resulting polygons are equal.

So, let's first handle the perimeter condition for splitting line MF.

Splitting line MF divides the triangle into two regions with equal perimeters.

So, the perimeter of ABF should equal the perimeter of AFMC.

Wait, let me clarify.

Wait, the splitting line MF goes from M to F on BC. So, the two resulting figures are triangle MBF and quadrilateral AFMC.

Therefore, perimeter of MBF is MB + BF + FM.

Perimeter of AFMC is AF + FM + MC + CA.

Wait, but CA is the same as AC, which is b.

Wait, let me write down:

Perimeter of MBF: MB + BF + FM

Perimeter of AFMC: AF + FM + MC + CA

But MB is c/2, BF is f (since BC is from 0 to 219, and F is at (f, 0)), FM is the distance from M to F.

Similarly, AF is the length from A to F, which is sqrt( (p - f)^2 + q^2 )

MC is the distance from M to C.

Wait, no, MC is the length from M to C, which is sqrt( (219 - p/2)^2 + (0 - q/2)^2 )

Similarly, FM is sqrt( (f - p/2)^2 + (0 - q/2)^2 )

This is getting very involved.

But perhaps we can use the perimeter equality condition.

So, perimeter of MBF equals perimeter of AFMC.

Thus,

MB + BF + FM = AF + FM + MC + CA

Simplify:

MB + BF = AF + MC + CA

But MB = c/2, BF = f, AF = sqrt( (p - f)^2 + q^2 ), MC = sqrt( (219 - p/2)^2 + (q/2)^2 ), CA = b.

Thus,

c/2 + f = sqrt( (p - f)^2 + q^2 ) + sqrt( (219 - p/2)^2 + (q/2)^2 ) + b

Similarly, for splitting line NG.

Perimeter of NGB equals perimeter of AGNC.

Perimeter of NGB: NG + GB + BN

Perimeter of AGNC: AG + GN + NC + CA

Wait, but similar to above.

Wait, actually, splitting line NG goes from N to G on BC.

So, the two resulting figures are triangle NGB and quadrilateral AGNC.

Therefore,

Perimeter(NGB) = NG + GB + BN

Perimeter(AGNC) = AG + GN + NC + CA

Again, setting equal:

NG + GB + BN = AG + GN + NC + CA

But BN is c/2, GB is 219 - g, AG is sqrt( (p - g)^2 + q^2 ), GN is sqrt( (g - (p + 219)/2 )^2 + (0 - q/2 )^2 ), NC is sqrt( (219 - (p + 219)/2 )^2 + (0 - q/2 )^2 ) = sqrt( ( (219 - p)/2 )^2 + (q/2)^2 ) = same as MC.

Therefore,

NG + (219 - g) + c/2 = sqrt( (p - g)^2 + q^2 ) + GN + sqrt( ( (219 - p)/2 )^2 + (q/2)^2 ) + b

But this seems symmetric to the previous equation.

Wait, perhaps there is a relationship between f and g.

But this is getting too involved algebraically.

Maybe it's better to assume specific values or find relations.

Wait, given that both splitting lines create equal perimeters, perhaps points F and G are symmetric in some way.

But not necessarily, unless the triangle is isoceles.

But the triangle may not be isoceles.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use the fact that the splitting lines through M and N create equal perimeters, leading to certain relations on f and g.

Wait, let me attempt to write the perimeter equality equations.

Starting with splitting line MF:

c/2 + f = sqrt( (p - f)^2 + q^2 ) + s + b

Where s = sqrt( (219 - p/2)^2 + (q/2)^2 )

Similarly, for splitting line NG:

c/2 + (219 - g) = sqrt( (p - g)^2 + q^2 ) + s + b

Wait, because for NG, BN is c/2, GB is 219 - g, and the rest is similar.

Wait, but in the perimeter equation for NG, AG is sqrt( (p - g)^2 + q^2 ), GN is sqrt( (g - (p + 219)/2 )^2 + (0 - q/2 )^2 ), and NC is s.

Wait, no, actually, in the perimeter equation for NG:

Perimeter(NGB) = NG + GB + BN

Perimeter(AGNC) = AG + GN + NC + CA

Wait, but in the equation, I had:

NG + (219 - g) + c/2 = sqrt( (p - g)^2 + q^2 ) + GN + s + b

Wait, but in reality, the perimeter equation is:

NG + GB + BN = AG + GN + NC + CA

So, NG + (219 - g) + c/2 = sqrt( (p - g)^2 + q^2 ) + GN + s + b

But that seems similar to the first equation, except with (219 - g) on the left and sqrt( (p - g)^2 + q^2 ) on the right.

But perhaps if I subtract the two equations, something cancels.

Wait, let me write both equations:

From MF:

c/2 + f = sqrt( (p - f)^2 + q^2 ) + s + b

From NG:

c/2 + (219 - g) = sqrt( (p - g)^2 + q^2 ) + GN + s + b

Wait, GN is sqrt( (g - (p + 219)/2 )^2 + (0 - q/2 )^2 )

Which simplifies to sqrt( (g - p/2 - 219/2 )^2 + (q/2)^2 )

Similarly, s is sqrt( (219 - p/2 )^2 + (q/2 )^2 )

So, let me denote:

s = sqrt( (219 - p/2 )^2 + (q/2 )^2 )

GN = sqrt( (g - p/2 - 219/2 )^2 + (q/2 )^2 ) = sqrt( ( (g - 219/2 ) - p/2 )^2 + (q/2 )^2 )

Which is similar to s, but shifted by g - 219/2.

Hmm, perhaps not directly useful.

Alternatively, subtract the two perimeter equations:

(c/2 + f) - (c/2 + 219 - g) = sqrt( (p - f)^2 + q^2 ) - sqrt( (p - g)^2 + q^2 ) + s + b - ( GN + s + b )

Simplify:

f - 219 + g = sqrt( (p - f)^2 + q^2 ) - sqrt( (p - g)^2 + q^2 ) - GN

But GN is sqrt( (g - p/2 - 219/2 )^2 + (q/2 )^2 )

So, this equation is:

f + g - 219 = sqrt( (p - f)^2 + q^2 ) - sqrt( (p - g)^2 + q^2 ) - sqrt( (g - p/2 - 219/2 )^2 + (q/2 )^2 )

This is getting extremely complicated.

I think this approach is not fruitful. Maybe I need to consider alternative strategies.

Wait, perhaps the triangle is isoceles? If so, then the splitting lines through M and N would coincide, but since they intersect at 30 degrees, maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps the triangle is right-angled.

Wait, if triangle ABC is right-angled, then we can exploit Pythagoras.

But the problem didn't specify that.

Wait, but with BC = 219, and AB and AC being integers, maybe it's a Heronian triangle.

Alternatively, perhaps assuming ABC is a 219-integer-integer triangle, with AB and AC integers.

Given that, maybe the triangle is such that the splitting lines through M and N intersect at 30 degrees.

Alternatively, perhaps using trigonometric identities.

Wait, perhaps using the angle between the two splitting lines.

Given that the splitting lines through M and N intersect at 30 degrees, the angle between them is 30 degrees.

So, if I can find the slopes of MF and NG, then compute the tangent of the angle between them, set it to tan(30°) = 1/√3, and solve for the sides.

So, let me denote:

Slope of MF: m1 = (-q/2)/(f - p/2 )

Slope of NG: m2 = (-q/2)/(g - (p + 219)/2 )

Then, tan(theta) = |(m2 - m1)/(1 + m1*m2)|

Set theta = 30°, so tan(theta) = 1/√3.

Therefore,

| (m2 - m1) / (1 + m1*m2) | = 1/√3

Plugging in m1 and m2,

| [ (-q/2)/(g - (p + 219)/2 ) - (-q/2)/(f - p/2 ) ] / [ 1 + ( (-q/2)/(f - p/2 ) )*( (-q/2)/(g - (p + 219)/2 ) ) ] | = 1/√3

Simplify numerator:

= | [ (-q/2)(1/(g - (p + 219)/2 ) - 1/(f - p/2 )) ] / [ 1 + ( q^2 /4 ) / ( (f - p/2 )(g - (p + 219)/2 ) ) ] |

Let me factor out (-q/2):

= | (-q/2) [ 1/(g - (p + 219)/2 ) - 1/(f - p/2 ) ] / [ 1 + ( q^2 /4 ) / ( (f - p/2 )(g - (p + 219)/2 ) ) ] |

The absolute value makes it positive, so we can drop the negative sign:

= (q/2) | [ 1/(g - (p + 219)/2 ) - 1/(f - p/2 ) ] / [ 1 + ( q^2 /4 ) / ( (f - p/2 )(g - (p + 219)/2 ) ) ] | = 1/√3

This is getting really complex. Maybe I need a smarter approach.

Wait, perhaps instead of assigning coordinates, I can consider that the splitting lines create equal perimeters, so perhaps the triangle is such that the lengths from M and N are proportionally equal.

Wait, another thought: In a triangle, the splitting line through the midpoint that creates equal perimeters must be parallel to a side.

But I'm not sure if that's true.

Wait, no, actually, in general, a line from a midpoint creating equal perimeters is called a "perpendicular bisector," but not necessarily parallel.

Wait, actually, in a triangle, a median divides it into two triangles with equal area, but not necessarily equal perimeter.

So, perhaps in this case, the splitting line is not a median, but a different line.

Wait, but in this problem, the splitting lines are through midpoints, but not medians, since they aren't connecting to the opposite vertex.

Wait, perhaps it's a line parallel to a side.

Wait, if a line is drawn through the midpoint parallel to a side, it will create a smaller triangle similar to the original, but scaled by 1/2.

But in that case, the perimeters would be in a ratio of 1/2, so not equal.

Therefore, that might not lead to equal perimeters.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the splitting line is such that the ratio of division on the opposite side is 1:1, making it a median.

But no, because the splitting line is through a midpoint, but not necessarily the median.

Wait, perhaps in this case, since the splitting line is through M, it is a median, but we already know that the median divides the triangle into two equal areas, but not necessarily equal perimeters.

So, unless the triangle is equilateral or something, but in this case, BC is 219, which is quite large, and AB and AC are integers, so it's unlikely to be equilateral.

Alternatively, perhaps the triangle is isoceles with AB = AC.

If that were the case, then the splitting lines through M and N would coincide, but in the problem, they intersect at 30 degrees, implying they are distinct lines, so perhaps the triangle is not isoceles.

Alternatively, maybe it's a 30-60-90 triangle or something, but without knowing, hard to tell.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that the triangle ABC has AB = c, AC = b, BC = a = 219.

Let me denote semiperimeter as s = (a + b + c)/2.

But I don't see a direct connection to the splitting lines.

Alternatively, perhaps the equal perimeters imply that the splitting lines are also symmedians or something similar.

Wait, symmedians are reflections of medians over angle bisectors, and they have properties related to equal ratios.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, another idea: If the splitting line through M creates equal perimeters, then perhaps the ratio of the areas is related to the ratio of the perimeters.

But no, equal perimeters don't necessarily mean equal areas.

Alternatively, perhaps using the concept that equal perimeters can be achieved by certain proportions.

Wait, perhaps the splitting line divides the opposite side in a specific ratio related to the sides.

Wait, according to some geometric principles, if a line is drawn from a point on one side of a triangle to another side, dividing it in the ratio of the adjacent sides, then the perimeters of the two resulting figures are equal.

Wait, let me test this.

Suppose in triangle ABC, a line is drawn from M on AB to D on AC such that AD/DC = AB/BC.

Then, perhaps the perimeters of AMD and DMCB are equal.

Is that true?

Let me verify.

Let’s denote AB = c, BC = a, AC = b.

If AD/DC = AB/BC = c/a, then AD = (c/(a + c)) * b, DC = (a/(a + c)) * b.

Then, perimeter of AMD = AM + MD + DA = c/2 + MD + AD

Perimeter of DMCB = DM + MC + CB + BD = MD + (b - AD) + a + BD

Compute perimeter AMD:

= c/2 + MD + (c b)/(a + c)

Perimeter DMCB:

= MD + (b - (c b)/(a + c)) + a + BD

Simplify:

= MD + (a b)/(a + c) + a + BD

Set equal:

c/2 + MD + (c b)/(a + c) = MD + (a b)/(a + c) + a + BD

Cancel MD:

c/2 + (c b)/(a + c) = (a b)/(a + c) + a + BD

Rearrange:

c/2 = (a b)/(a + c) - (c b)/(a + c) + a + BD

Simplify:

c/2 = ( (a - c) b )/(a + c ) + a + BD

But this doesn't seem obviously zero or something, so perhaps this approach is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the condition for equal perimeters requires a different ratio.

Wait, maybe it's the harmonic mean or something.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio is such that (AD/DC) = (AM / MB) * (AB / BC). Not sure.

Wait, maybe I can refer to the concept of equal perimeters in terms of cevians.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is too complex for manual calculation, and I need to look for patterns.

Given that the splitting lines through M and N intersect at 30 degrees, which is a special angle, perhaps the triangle has sides that form a 30-60-90 triangle, or some multiple thereof.

Alternatively, perhaps the triangle is such that the sides AB and AC are multiples of √3 and 1, leading to 30-degree angles.

Alternatively, since the splitting lines intersect at 30 degrees, perhaps the triangle is designed such that the medians or splitting lines create that angle.

Wait, perhaps using trigonometric identities for the angle between two lines.

Given that, if I can express the slopes m1 and m2 in terms of the triangle's sides, then compute the angle between them.

But this seems too vague.

Alternatively, maybe using vectors to represent the splitting lines and compute the angle.

Wait, since M is the midpoint of AB, vector M is (A + B)/2.

Similarly, N is the midpoint of AC, vector N is (A + C)/2.

But splitting lines through M and N intersect at 30 degrees.

But I need more concrete relationships.

Wait, another thought: The splitting lines are such that they create equal perimeters, which as per some theorem, relates to the ratio of division on the opposite side.

Wait, in order to create equal perimeters, the ratio of division on BC must be such that the sum of the lengths on either side equals the remaining sides.

But as we saw earlier, the perimeter condition leads to a relation between AD and DC, etc.

Wait, perhaps I can consider the following: For the splitting line through M intersecting BC at F, the ratio BF / FC is equal to (AB + BM) / (AC + CM)

Wait, I recall that in some cases, the ratio is related to the sum of adjacent sides.

Wait, let me check.

If a line is drawn from M to F on BC, such that perimeter of ABF equals perimeter of AFMC.

Then, perimeter(ABF) = AB + BF + AF

perimeter(AFMC) = AF + FM + MC + AC

Set equal:

AB + BF + AF = AF + FM + MC + AC

Simplify:

AB + BF = FM + MC + AC

But AB = c, BF = x, FM = distance from M to F, which is sqrt( (f - p/2)^2 + (0 - q/2)^2 )

MC is sqrt( (219 - p/2)^2 + (q/2)^2 )

AC = b

So,

c + x = sqrt( (f - p/2)^2 + (q/2)^2 ) + sqrt( (219 - p/2)^2 + (q/2)^2 ) + b

But this is similar to earlier equations.

Wait, perhaps if I assume that F is such that BF = (AB + BM) / (AB + AC) * BC.

Wait, that might not be accurate.

Alternatively, perhaps BF / FC = (AB + BM) / (AC + CM)

Since M is the midpoint of AB, BM = AB/2 = c/2

Similarly, CM is the length from C to M.

CM can be calculated via coordinates:

CM = sqrt( (p - p/2)^2 + (q - q/2)^2 ) = sqrt( (p/2)^2 + (q/2)^2 ) = (1/2)sqrt(p^2 + q^2 ) = (1/2)AB = c/2

Wait, interesting! So, CM = c/2

Similarly, AC = b = sqrt( (219 - p)^2 + q^2 )

Also, AB = c = sqrt( p^2 + q^2 )

So, the ratio BF / FC = (AB + BM)/(AC + CM) = (c + c/2)/(b + c/2) = (3c/2)/(b + c/2 )

= (3c) / (2b + c )

Therefore, BF / FC = 3c / (2b + c )

Similarly, for the splitting line through N.

Similarly, for splitting line through N intersecting BC at G.

By the same logic, BG / GC = (AB + AN)/(AC + CN )

But AN = AC / 2 = b / 2

CN is the length from C to N.

Point N is midpoint of AC, so CN = AC / 2 = b / 2

Therefore, BG / GC = (AB + AN)/(AC + CN ) = (c + b/2 ) / (b + b/2 ) = (c + b/2 ) / (3b/2 ) = (2c + b ) / (3b )

So, BG / GC = (2c + b ) / (3b )

Therefore, now we have BF / FC = 3c / (2b + c ) and BG / GC = (2c + b ) / (3b )

Therefore, points F and G divide BC in known ratios.

Therefore, BF = [3c / (3c + 2b + c ) ] * BC ?

Wait, no, BF / FC = 3c / (2b + c )

Therefore, BF = [ 3c / (3c + 2b + c ) ] * BC? Wait, no, more accurately,

BF / FC = 3c / (2b + c )

Therefore, BF = (3c / (3c + 2b + c )) * BC ?

Wait, no, the sum of the ratio is 3c + (2b + c ) = 4c + 2b.

Wait, no, BF / FC = 3c : (2b + c )

Therefore, BF = [ 3c / (3c + 2b + c ) ] * BC = [ 3c / (4c + 2b ) ] * 219

Wait, no, BC is 219, so BF = (3c / (3c + 2b )) * 219

Wait, no, wait, ratio is 3c : (2b + c )

Total parts = 3c + 2b + c = 4c + 2b

Wait, no, the ratio BF : FC = 3c : (2b + c )

Therefore, BF = (3c / (3c + 2b + c )) * BC

Wait, no, actually, BF : FC = 3c : (2b + c )

Therefore, BF = (3c / (3c + 2b + c )) * BC

Wait, no, that's not correct.

Wait, BF / FC = 3c / (2b + c )

So, BF = (3c / (3c + 2b )) * BC

Wait, no, if BF / FC = m / n, then BF = (m / (m + n )) * BC

So, BF = (3c / (3c + 2b + c )) * 219? Wait, no.

Wait, the ratio is m:n = 3c : (2b + c )

Therefore, BF = (3c / (3c + 2b + c )) * BC?

Wait, no, m:n corresponds to BF:FC, so BF = (m / (m + n )) * BC.

Here, m = 3c, n = 2b + c

Therefore, BF = (3c / (3c + 2b + c )) * 219 = (3c / (4c + 2b )) * 219

Similarly, FC = (2b + c ) / (4c + 2b ) * 219

Similarly, for point G.

BG / GC = (2c + b ) / (3b )

So, BG = (2c + b ) / (2c + b + 3b ) * 219 = (2c + b ) / (2c + 4b ) * 219

Wait, no, BG / GC = (2c + b ) / (3b )

Therefore, BG = (2c + b ) / ( (2c + b ) + 3b ) * 219 = (2c + b ) / (2c + 4b ) * 219

Simplify denominator: 2c + 4b = 2(c + 2b )

Similarly, numerator: 2c + b

So, BG = (2c + b ) / (2(c + 2b )) * 219

Similarly, GC = 3b / (2c + 4
