 The problem: 
Find the three-digit positive integer $\underline{a}\,\underline{b}\,\underline{c}$ whose representation in base nine is $\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\,\underline{a}_{\,\text{nine}},$ where $a,$ $b,$ and $c$ are (not necessarily distinct) digits.


To solve for the three-digit positive integer \(\underline{a}\,\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\) whose representation in base nine is \(\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\,\underline{a}_{\,\text{nine}}\), we start by expressing both numbers in base ten.

First, let's express \(\underline{a}\,\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\) in base ten:
\[
\underline{a}\,\underline{b}\,\underline{c} = 100a + 10b + c
\]

Next, let's express \(\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\,\underline{a}_{\,\text{nine}}\) in base ten. Since \(\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\,\underline{a}_{\,\text{nine}}\) is a number in base nine, we convert it as follows:
\[
\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\,\underline{a}_{\,\text{nine}} = b \cdot 9^2 + c \cdot 9^1 + a \cdot 9^0 = 81b + 9c + a
\]

We are given that these two expressions are equal:
\[
100a + 10b + c = 81b + 9c + a
\]

To find \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\), we rearrange the equation:
\[
100a + 10b + c - a - 81b - 9c = 0
\]
\[
99a - 71b - 8c = 0
\]

Rearrange to isolate \(a\):
\[
99a = 71b + 8c
\]

Since \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are digits (0 through 9), we need to find values that satisfy this equation. We start by testing possible values for \(a\).

### Testing \(a = 1\):
\[
99 \cdot 1 = 71b + 8c
\]
\[
99 = 71b + 8c
\]
We need to find integer solutions for \(b\) and \(c\) such that \(0 \leq b, c \leq 9\). Testing values of \(b\):

- For \(b = 1\):
  \[
  99 = 71 \cdot 1 + 8c
  \]
  \[
  99 = 71 + 8c
  \]
  \[
  28 = 8c
  \]
  \[
  c = 3.5 \quad (\text{not an integer})
  \]

- For \(b = 2\):
  \[
  99 = 71 \cdot 2 + 8c
  \]
  \[
  99 = 142 + 8c
  \]
  \[
  -43 = 8c \quad (\text{not possible since } c \geq 0)
  \]

- For \(b = 3\):
  \[
  99 = 71 \cdot 3 + 8c
  \]
  \[
  99 = 213 + 8c
  \]
  \[
  -114 = 8c \quad (\text{not possible since } c \geq 0)
  \]

Since none of these values work, we move to the next value of \(a\).

### Testing \(a = 2\):
\[
99 \cdot 2 = 71b + 8c
\]
\[
198 = 71b + 8c
\]
We need to find integer solutions for \(b\) and \(c\) such that \(0 \leq b, c \leq 9\). Testing values of \(b\):

- For \(b = 2\):
  \[
  198 = 71 \cdot 2 + 8c
  \]
  \[
  198 = 142 + 8c
  \]
  \[
  56 = 8c
  \]
  \[
  c = 7
  \]

Thus, \(a = 2\), \(b = 2\), and \(c = 7\) satisfy the equation. Therefore, the three-digit integer is:
\[
\underline{a}\,\underline{b}\,\underline{c} = 227
\]

To verify, we convert \(227\) to base nine:
\[
227_{\,\text{base 10}} = 2 \cdot 9^2 + 2 \cdot 9^1 + 7 \cdot 9^0 = 162 + 18 + 7 = 187_{\,\text{base 9}}
\]

Thus, the representation in base nine is indeed \(\underline{2}\,\underline{7}\,\underline{2}_{\,\text{nine}}\), confirming our solution.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{227}
\]
