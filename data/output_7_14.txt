 The problem: 
Find the three-digit positive integer $\underline{a}\,\underline{b}\,\underline{c}$ whose representation in base nine is $\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\,\underline{a}_{\,\text{nine}},$ where $a,$ $b,$ and $c$ are (not necessarily distinct) digits.


To solve the problem, we need to find a three-digit positive integer \(\underline{a}\,\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\) such that its representation in base nine is \(\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\,\underline{a}_{\,\text{nine}}\). This means that the number \(100a + 10b + c\) in base ten is equal to the number \(81b + 9c + a\) in base nine.

Let's set up the equation:
\[100a + 10b + c = 81b + 9c + a.\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[100a - a + 10b - 81b + c - 9c = 0,\]
\[99a - 71b - 8c = 0.\]
This simplifies to:
\[99a = 71b + 8c.\]
Since \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are digits (i.e., integers from 0 to 8 for \(b\) and \(c\), and from 1 to 9 for \(a\)), we need to find values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) that satisfy this equation.

First, let's check if there are any simple solutions. We can start by testing small values for \(a\).

If \(a = 1\):
\[99 = 71b + 8c.\]
We need to find \(b\) and \(c\) such that this equation holds. Testing \(b = 1\):
\[99 = 71 \cdot 1 + 8c,\]
\[99 = 71 + 8c,\]
\[28 = 8c,\]
\[c = \frac{28}{8} = 3.5,\]
which is not an integer. So, \(b = 1\) does not work.

Testing \(b = 2\):
\[99 = 71 \cdot 2 + 8c,\]
\[99 = 142 + 8c,\]
which is not possible since 142 is already greater than 99.

Testing \(b = 3\):
\[99 = 71 \cdot 3 + 8c,\]
\[99 = 213 + 8c,\]
which is also not possible.

Since increasing \(b\) further will only increase the left side of the equation more than necessary, we should try \(a = 2\).

If \(a = 2\):
\[198 = 71b + 8c.\]
Testing \(b = 2\):
\[198 = 71 \cdot 2 + 8c,\]
\[198 = 142 + 8c,\]
\[56 = 8c,\]
\[c = 7.\]
So, \(a = 2\), \(b = 2\), and \(c = 7\) is a solution. Let's verify this solution:
The number in base ten is \(227\), and in base nine, it is \(272\). Converting \(272\) to base ten, we get:
\[2 \cdot 81 + 7 \cdot 9 + 2 = 162 + 63 + 2 = 227.\]
The solution is correct. Therefore, the three-digit positive integer is \(\boxed{227}\).
