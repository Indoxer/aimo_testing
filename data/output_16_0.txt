 The problem: 
Find the remainder when\[\binom{\binom{3}{2}}{2} + \binom{\binom{4}{2}}{2} + \dots +  \binom{\binom{40}{2}}{2}\]is divided by $1000$.


Alright, let me try to figure out this problem. So, we need to find the remainder when the sum from n=3 to n=40 of binomial coefficients squared is divided by 1000. More specifically, it's the sum of binomial(binomial(n,2), 2) for each n from 3 to 40, and then take that total modulo 1000.

First off, I need to understand what binomial(binomial(n,2), 2) actually represents. Let's break it down. The inner binomial coefficient is binomial(n,2), which is the number of ways to choose 2 items from n, right? That equals n*(n-1)/2. Then, we're taking binomial of that result with 2 again. So, binomial(k, 2) where k = binomial(n,2). So, binomial(k,2) is k*(k - 1)/2.

Putting it all together, binomial(binomial(n,2), 2) would be [binomial(n,2)] * [binomial(n,2) - 1] / 2. Let me write that out:

binomial(binomial(n,2), 2) = [ (n(n - 1)/2) * (n(n - 1)/2 - 1) ] / 2

Simplify that expression a bit. Let me compute the numerator first:

Numerator = (n(n - 1)/2) * (n(n - 1)/2 - 1)
Let me denote m = n(n - 1)/2 for simplicity, so Numerator = m*(m - 1)

So, Numerator = m^2 - m

Therefore, binomial(binomial(n,2), 2) = (m^2 - m)/2

Substituting back m = n(n - 1)/2,

We have:
binomial(binomial(n,2), 2) = [ (n(n - 1)/2)^2 - (n(n - 1)/2) ] / 2
= [ (n²(n - 1)²)/4 - n(n - 1)/2 ] / 2
= [ (n²(n - 1)²)/4 - 2n(n - 1)/4 ] / 2
Wait, maybe it's better to just expand it step by step without substituting variables.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a combinatorial interpretation or a formula that can simplify this expression.

Wait, another thought: binomial(k,2) is equal to (k^2 - k)/2. So if k = binomial(n,2), then binomial(k,2) = (k^2 - k)/2 = [ (binomial(n,2))^2 - binomial(n,2) ] / 2

But since we already know binomial(n,2) is n(n - 1)/2, plugging that in:

[ ( (n(n - 1)/2 )^2 - (n(n - 1)/2) ) ] / 2

Which simplifies to:

[ (n²(n - 1)²)/4 - n(n - 1)/2 ] / 2

Multiplying numerator and denominator:

= (n²(n - 1)²)/8 - n(n - 1)/4

Hmm, okay, so now we have an expression for each term in the sum. Therefore, our sum S is:

S = sum_{n=3}^{40} [ (n²(n - 1)²)/8 - n(n - 1)/4 ]

We can split this into two separate sums:

S = (1/8) * sum_{n=3}^{40} n²(n - 1)² - (1/4) * sum_{n=3}^{40} n(n - 1)

Let me handle these two sums separately.

First, let's compute Sum1 = sum_{n=3}^{40} n²(n - 1)²

Second, compute Sum2 = sum_{n=3}^{40} n(n - 1)

Then, S = (1/8)*Sum1 - (1/4)*Sum2

Now, let's compute Sum2 first because it seems simpler.

Sum2 = sum_{n=3}^{40} n(n - 1) = sum_{n=3}^{40} (n² - n) = sum_{n=3}^{40} n² - sum_{n=3}^{40} n

I remember that the sum of squares formula is sum_{k=1}^m k² = m(m + 1)(2m + 1)/6, and the sum of integers is sum_{k=1}^m k = m(m + 1)/2.

Therefore, Sum2 can be expressed as:

Sum2 = [sum_{n=1}^{40} n² - 1² - 2²] - [sum_{n=1}^{40} n - 1 - 2]

Compute each part:

sum_{n=1}^{40} n² = 40*41*81/6. Let me compute that:

40*41 = 1640; 1640*81 = let's compute 1640*80 = 131200, plus 1640*1 = 1640, so 131200 + 1640 = 132840. Divide by 6: 132840 / 6 = 22140.

Similarly, sum_{n=1}^{40} n = 40*41/2 = 820.

Therefore,

Sum2 = [22140 - 1 - 4] - [820 - 1 - 2] = (22140 - 5) - (820 - 3) = 22135 - 817 = 21318.

Wait, let me verify that calculation.

First, sum from n=3 to 40 of n² is sum from 1 to 40 minus 1² and 2², so 22140 - 1 - 4 = 22135.

Sum from n=3 to 40 of n is sum from 1 to 40 minus 1 and 2, so 820 - 1 - 2 = 817.

Thus, Sum2 = 22135 - 817 = 21318. Okay, that seems correct.

Now, moving on to Sum1, which is sum_{n=3}^{40} n²(n - 1)².

This looks a bit more complicated. Let's see if we can express this in terms of known summations.

First, note that n²(n - 1)² = [n(n - 1)]² = (n² - n)^2.

Expanding that, (n² - n)^2 = n^4 - 2n³ + n².

So, Sum1 = sum_{n=3}^{40} (n^4 - 2n³ + n²) = sum_{n=3}^{40} n^4 - 2*sum_{n=3}^{40} n³ + sum_{n=3}^{40} n².

Again, we can use standard formulas for sums of powers.

Recall that:

sum_{k=1}^m k = m(m + 1)/2,

sum_{k=1}^m k² = m(m + 1)(2m + 1)/6,

sum_{k=1}^m k³ = [m(m + 1)/2]^2,

sum_{k=1}^m k^4 = m(m + 1)(2m + 1)(3m² - 3m + 1)/30.

So, let's compute each component:

First, compute sum_{n=3}^{40} n^4 = sum_{n=1}^{40} n^4 - 1^4 - 2^4 = sum_{n=1}^{40} n^4 - 1 - 16.

Similarly,

sum_{n=3}^{40} n³ = sum_{n=1}^{40} n³ - 1³ - 2³ = sum_{n=1}^{40} n³ - 1 - 8.

sum_{n=3}^{40} n² = sum_{n=1}^{40} n² - 1² - 2² = 22140 - 1 - 4 = 22135, which we already computed earlier.

So, let's calculate each term step by step.

First, compute sum_{n=1}^{40} n^4:

Using the formula: m(m + 1)(2m + 1)(3m² - 3m + 1)/30 where m=40.

Compute each part:

40*41 = 1640,

2m + 1 = 81,

3m² - 3m + 1: 3*(40)^2 - 3*40 + 1 = 3*1600 - 120 + 1 = 4800 - 120 + 1 = 4681.

So, multiplying all together:

1640 * 81 = 132,840,

132,840 * 4681 = Hmm, that's a big number. Maybe I should compute this step by step.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here because computing such a large product might not be feasible manually. Alternatively, maybe there's a smarter way to compute this?

Wait, perhaps I can factor things differently. Let me check the formula again.

The formula is sum_{k=1}^m k^4 = m(m + 1)(2m + 1)(3m² - 3m + 1)/30.

So, plugging m=40:

sum = 40*41*81*(3*(40)^2 - 3*40 + 1)/30.

Compute numerator:

40*41 = 1640,

1640*81: Let's compute 1600*81 = 129,600; 40*81=3,240; so total is 129,600 + 3,240 = 132,840.

Next, compute (3*40² - 3*40 + 1):

3*1600 = 4800,

4800 - 120 = 4680,

4680 + 1 = 4681.

So, numerator is 132,840 * 4681.

Wow, that's a huge number. Maybe instead of calculating the exact value, I can compute it modulo something later? But wait, hold on, because eventually, we'll have to compute (Sum1)/8 - (Sum2)/4, and then take mod 1000.

Maybe instead of computing the entire Sum1, which is going to be a massive number, we can compute it modulo 1000*8 or something. Wait, but perhaps we can compute each term modulo 1000 and keep track.

Wait, no, because we are dealing with division by 8 and 4, which complicates matters when working modulo 1000. Maybe an alternative approach is better.

Wait, perhaps instead of trying to compute each Sum1 and Sum2 directly, maybe there's a telescoping series or some combinatorial identity that can help us simplify the original expression.

Looking back at the original expression for each term: binomial(binomial(n, 2), 2).

Wait, another idea: binomial(binomial(n,2), 2) counts the number of ways to choose 2 pairs from n elements, where order doesn't matter. Hmm, but maybe that's not helpful.

Wait, alternatively, think of binomial(n,2) as the number of edges in a complete graph with n vertices. Then binomial(binomial(n,2), 2) is the number of ways to choose 2 edges from that complete graph. So, the sum is counting the number of ways to choose 2 edges across all complete graphs from 3 to 40 vertices.

But that's a combinatorial interpretation, but I don't see how that helps immediately. Perhaps we can find a generating function or some other combinatorial identity, but maybe that's overcomplicating.

Wait, let me go back to the algebraic approach. We had:

Sum1 = sum_{n=3}^{40} [n^4 - 2n³ + n²]

We can compute this as:

sum_{n=3}^{40} n^4 = sum_{n=1}^{40} n^4 - 1 - 16 = sum_{n=1}^{40} n^4 - 17

Similarly, sum_{n=3}^{40} n³ = sum_{n=1}^{40} n³ - 1 - 8 = sum_{n=1}^{40} n³ - 9

And sum_{n=3}^{40} n² = sum_{n=1}^{40} n² - 1 - 4 = 22140 - 5 = 22135

So, Sum1 = [sum_{n=1}^{40} n^4 - 17] - 2*[sum_{n=1}^{40} n³ - 9] + [22135]

Let me compute each sum:

First, compute sum_{n=1}^{40} n^4. As before, using the formula:

sum = 40*41*81*(3*40² - 3*40 + 1)/30

But 40*41*81 is 132,840 as before, multiplied by 4681 gives:

132,840 * 4681

This is going to be a huge number, but maybe we can compute it modulo 10000 or something to make it manageable? Wait, but perhaps not, because we have to subtract 17, multiply by -2, add 22135, etc., and then divide by 8 and subtract something else.

Alternatively, maybe we can compute each term modulo 1000000 or something, but that still may not be helpful.

Wait, perhaps it's better to note that the entire expression S is being taken modulo 1000, so perhaps we can compute each term modulo 1000 and then sum them up modulo 1000.

But considering that each term is binomial(binomial(n,2), 2), which is a very large number even for n=40, computing each term modulo 1000 might not be straightforward either.

Wait, maybe we can find a pattern or recurrence relation for binomial(binomial(n,2), 2) modulo 1000.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider expanding the expression algebraically further.

Earlier, we had:

binomial(binomial(n,2), 2) = [n(n - 1)/2]^2 - [n(n - 1)/2]/2

Wait, so that simplifies to [n²(n - 1)²]/4 - [n(n - 1)]/4

Which is equal to [n²(n - 1)² - n(n - 1)] / 4

So, each term is [n²(n - 1)² - n(n - 1)] / 4

Therefore, the entire sum S is:

sum_{n=3}^{40} [n²(n - 1)² - n(n - 1)] / 4

Which can be written as (1/4) * sum_{n=3}^{40} [n²(n - 1)² - n(n - 1)]

So, S = (1/4)*(Sum1 - Sum2)

Where Sum1 was defined as sum_{n=3}^{40} n²(n - 1)² and Sum2 as sum_{n=3}^{40} n(n - 1), which we already computed as 21318.

Therefore, S = (1/4)*(Sum1 - 21318)

But we still need to compute Sum1.

Alternatively, maybe we can find a way to express Sum1 - Sum2 in a form that can be simplified.

Wait, looking back, we had:

Each term is [n²(n - 1)² - n(n - 1)] / 4

But n²(n - 1)² is [n(n - 1)]², which is similar to (n² - n)^2.

Wait, perhaps we can express this as [ (n(n - 1))² - n(n - 1) ] / 4

Factor out n(n - 1):

= [n(n - 1)(n(n - 1) - 1)] / 4

So, each term is [n(n - 1)(n² - n - 1)] / 4

Hmm, not sure if that helps much.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to compute Sum1 and Sum2 separately.

Given that Sum2 is 21318, we just need Sum1.

Wait, maybe we can compute Sum1 modulo 4000 or something so that when we subtract Sum2, which is 21318, and then divide by 4, we can manage the modulus.

Alternatively, since we need the result modulo 1000, perhaps we can compute everything modulo 4000, because 4 divides 4000, and 4000 is a multiple of 1000. So, computing modulo 4000 could allow us to take modulo 1000 at the end.

Wait, let me think about this.

If I compute each term modulo 4000, then sum them up, and then take modulo 1000, it should give me the same result as computing the entire sum modulo 1000.

But given that the terms themselves are quite large, even for n=40, the term binomial(binomial(40,2), 2) is enormous, but modulo 4000 might reduce it.

Wait, but maybe even more manageable: since each term is being added, and we can compute each term modulo 4000, then sum them modulo 4000, and then take modulo 1000.

Yes, that could work.

So, plan:

1. For each n from 3 to 40, compute binomial(binomial(n,2), 2) modulo 4000.

2. Sum all those values modulo 4000.

3. Take the result modulo 1000 to get the final answer.

That sounds feasible, though computationally intensive by hand, but perhaps we can find patterns or periodicity in binomial(binomial(n,2), 2) modulo 4000.

Alternatively, note that 4000 is 16 * 250, which is 16 * 2 * 125, so 32 * 125. Maybe using Chinese Remainder Theorem? But perhaps that complicates things.

Alternatively, note that 4000 is 16 * 250, so perhaps compute modulo 16 and modulo 250, then combine.

But that also might not save much time. Alternatively, perhaps recognize that binomial(binomial(n,2),2) grows polynomially, so modulo 4000 will cycle every certain period. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe compute each term modulo 4000 directly.

Wait, let's consider that binomial(k,2) is k(k - 1)/2. So, for each n, binomial(n,2) is k = n(n - 1)/2.

Then, binomial(k,2) is k(k - 1)/2 = [n(n - 1)/2][n(n - 1)/2 - 1]/2.

So, for each n, compute k = n(n - 1)/2, then compute [k(k - 1)] / 2.

But k = n(n - 1)/2, so k must be an integer because n(n - 1) is always even.

Therefore, k is integer, so k(k - 1) is even, so dividing by 2 gives an integer.

Thus, binomial(k,2) is an integer.

So, for each n, compute binomial(k,2) where k = binomial(n,2).

Therefore, let's define f(n) = binomial(binomial(n,2),2). Our task is to compute sum_{n=3}^{40} f(n) mod 1000.

So, perhaps the best approach is to compute each f(n) modulo 4000 and then sum them up, and finally take modulo 1000.

But computing f(n) for n from 3 to 40 is 38 terms. It might be tedious, but perhaps manageable if we find a pattern or formula.

Wait, let's see if we can express f(n) in a different way.

f(n) = binomial(k,2) where k = binomial(n,2) = n(n - 1)/2

So, f(n) = [k(k - 1)] / 2 = [ (n(n - 1)/2)(n(n - 1)/2 - 1) ] / 2

As before, simplifying:

f(n) = [ (n(n - 1)/2)^2 - (n(n - 1)/2) ] / 2

= [n²(n - 1)² / 4 - n(n - 1)/2] / 2

= n²(n - 1)² / 8 - n(n - 1)/4

Therefore, f(n) = (n²(n - 1)² - 2n(n - 1)) / 8

So, f(n) = [n(n - 1)(n² - n - 2)] / 8

Wait, factoring numerator:

n(n - 1)(n² - n - 2) = n(n - 1)(n - 2)(n + 1)

Because n² - n - 2 factors into (n - 2)(n + 1).

So, f(n) = [n(n - 1)(n - 2)(n + 1)] / 8

That's interesting! So, f(n) is equal to n(n - 1)(n - 2)(n + 1)/8

Which can be written as:

f(n) = [n(n - 1)(n - 2)(n + 1)] / 8

So, that's a quartic in n, which makes sense.

So, f(n) = [n(n - 1)(n - 2)(n + 1)] / 8

Perhaps this form is more useful for computation modulo 4000.

Note that n(n - 1)(n - 2)(n + 1) is a product of four consecutive integers: n, n - 1, n - 2, n + 1.

Wait, except that n - 2 and n + 1 are not adjacent. So, it's n, n - 1, n - 2, and n + 1.

Wait, but n+1 is two apart from n-1, so they are not consecutive.

But regardless, the product is n(n - 1)(n - 2)(n + 1). Let's rearrange:

n(n - 1)(n - 2)(n + 1) = [n(n - 1)(n - 2)](n + 1)

But n(n - 1)(n - 2) is n³ - 3n² + 2n, multiplied by (n + 1):

(n³ - 3n² + 2n)(n + 1) = n⁴ - 3n³ + 2n² + n³ - 3n² + 2n = n⁴ - 2n³ - n² + 2n

Wait, but this contradicts our previous expression where f(n) = [n²(n - 1)² - 2n(n - 1)] / 8. Wait, maybe my expansion was wrong.

Wait, n(n - 1)(n - 2)(n + 1) = n(n - 1)(n² - n - 2). Let's confirm:

(n - 1)(n² - n - 2) = n³ - n² - 2n - n² + n + 2 = n³ - 2n² - n + 2

Multiply by n: n⁴ - 2n³ - n² + 2n

So yes, that matches.

But earlier, we had f(n) = [n²(n - 1)² - 2n(n - 1)] / 8

Let's compute n²(n - 1)² - 2n(n - 1):

= n²(n² - 2n + 1) - 2n² + 2n

= n⁴ - 2n³ + n² - 2n² + 2n

= n⁴ - 2n³ - n² + 2n

Which is exactly the same as above. So, f(n) = (n⁴ - 2n³ - n² + 2n)/8

Therefore, f(n) = [n⁴ - 2n³ - n² + 2n] / 8

So, perhaps this expression is more useful.

So, f(n) = (n⁴ - 2n³ - n² + 2n)/8

Therefore, the sum S = sum_{n=3}^{40} f(n) = sum_{n=3}^{40} (n⁴ - 2n³ - n² + 2n)/8

Which is the same as (1/8)*sum_{n=3}^{40}(n⁴ - 2n³ - n² + 2n)

Which can be separated as:

(1/8)[sum_{n=3}^{40}n⁴ - 2sum_{n=3}^{40}n³ - sum_{n=3}^{40}n² + 2sum_{n=3}^{40}n]

So, let's compute each of these sums:

We already computed sum_{n=3}^{40}n² = 22135

sum_{n=3}^{40}n = 21318

We need sum_{n=3}^{40}n³ and sum_{n=3}^{40}n⁴

Earlier, we had the formula for sum_{n=1}^m n³ = [m(m + 1)/2]^2

Similarly, sum_{n=1}^m n⁴ = m(m + 1)(2m + 1)(3m² - 3m + 1)/30

So, let's compute sum_{n=3}^{40}n³ = sum_{n=1}^{40}n³ - 1 - 8 = [40*41/2]^2 - 9

Compute [40*41/2]^2:

40*41 = 1640; 1640/2 = 820; 820² = 672,400

Therefore, sum_{n=1}^{40}n³ = 672,400

Hence, sum_{n=3}^{40}n³ = 672,400 - 1 - 8 = 672,391

Similarly, sum_{n=3}^{40}n⁴ = sum_{n=1}^{40}n⁴ - 1 - 16

Compute sum_{n=1}^{40}n⁴ using the formula:

sum_{n=1}^{40}n⁴ = 40*41*81*(3*40² - 3*40 + 1)/30

Compute each part:

40*41 = 1640

1640*81 = let's compute 1600*81 = 129,600; 40*81=3,240; total=129,600 + 3,240=132,840

3*40² = 3*1600=4800; 4800 - 120=4680; 4680 + 1=4681

So, numerator is 132,840 * 4681

This is a huge number. Let me see if I can compute this modulo 32000 or something, but wait, perhaps I can compute it step by step.

Wait, 132,840 * 4681. Let me see:

First, 132,840 * 4000 = 531,360,000

132,840 * 600 = 79,704,000

132,840 * 80 = 10,627,200

132,840 * 1 = 132,840

Adding them together:

531,360,000 + 79,704,000 = 611,064,000

611,064,000 + 10,627,200 = 621,691,200

621,691,200 + 132,840 = 621,824,040

Therefore, sum_{n=1}^{40}n⁴ = 621,824,040 / 30

Divide 621,824,040 by 30:

621,824,040 ÷ 10 = 62,182,404

62,182,404 ÷ 3 = 20,727,468

Therefore, sum_{n=1}^{40}n⁴ = 20,727,468

Therefore, sum_{n=3}^{40}n⁴ = 20,727,468 - 1 - 16 = 20,727,451

Therefore, now we can plug back into the expression for S:

S = (1/8)[sum_{n=3}^{40}n⁴ - 2sum_{n=3}^{40}n³ - sum_{n=3}^{40}n² + 2sum_{n=3}^{40}n]

Plugging in the numbers:

sum_{n=3}^{40}n⁴ = 20,727,451

sum_{n=3}^{40}n³ = 672,391

sum_{n=3}^{40}n² = 22,135

sum_{n=3}^{40}n = 21,318

So,

S = (1/8)[20,727,451 - 2*672,391 - 22,135 + 2*21,318]

Compute each term inside the brackets:

20,727,451

- 2*672,391 = -1,344,782

- 22,135

+ 2*21,318 = +42,636

So, adding these together:

Start with 20,727,451

Subtract 1,344,782: 20,727,451 - 1,344,782 = 19,382,669

Subtract 22,135: 19,382,669 - 22,135 = 19,360,534

Add 42,636: 19,360,534 + 42,636 = 19,403,170

Therefore, S = 19,403,170 / 8

Compute 19,403,170 ÷ 8:

19,403,170 ÷ 8 = ?

Well, 8 goes into 19 twice (16), remainder 3.

Bring down 4: 34. 8 goes into 34 four times (32), remainder 2.

Bring down 0: 20. 8 goes into 20 twice (16), remainder 4.

Bring down 3: 43. 8 goes into 43 five times (40), remainder 3.

Bring down 1: 31. 8 goes into 31 three times (24), remainder 7.

Bring down 7: 77. 8 goes into 77 nine times (72), remainder 5.

Bring down 0: 50. 8 goes into 50 six times (48), remainder 2.

So, writing it all together: 2,425,396.25

Wait, that can't be right because 8*2,425,396 = 19,403,168, and adding 0.25*8=2, so 19,403,170. So, it's 2,425,396.25

But S must be an integer because we're summing integers. So, clearly, I must have messed up somewhere.

Wait, hold on, let me double-check the calculations.

First, sum_{n=3}^{40}n⁴ = 20,727,451

sum_{n=3}^{40}n³ = 672,391

sum_{n=3}^{40}n² = 22,135

sum_{n=3}^{40}n = 21,318

So,

20,727,451 - 2*672,391 = 20,727,451 - 1,344,782 = 19,382,669

19,382,669 - 22,135 = 19,360,534

19,360,534 + 2*21,318 = 19,360,534 + 42,636 = 19,403,170

So, that's correct.

19,403,170 / 8 = ?

Let me compute 19,403,170 ÷ 8:

8 × 2,425,396 = 19,403,168

So, 19,403,170 - 19,403,168 = 2

Therefore, 19,403,170 ÷ 8 = 2,425,396 with a remainder of 2.

Wait, that means S = 2,425,396 + 2/8 = 2,425,396.25

But S must be an integer, so there must be a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing sum_{n=1}^{40}n⁴.

Earlier, I computed sum_{n=1}^{40}n⁴ = 20,727,468, then subtracted 1 and 16 to get 20,727,451.

Wait, let me recompute sum_{n=1}^{40}n⁴ using the formula:

sum_{n=1}^m n⁴ = m(m + 1)(2m + 1)(3m² - 3m + 1)/30

For m=40:

Compute numerator:

40*41 = 1640

2*40 + 1 = 81

3*(40)^2 - 3*40 + 1 = 4800 - 120 + 1 = 4681

So, numerator = 1640 * 81 * 4681

Earlier, I computed 1640*81 = 132,840

Then, 132,840 * 4681 = ?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in multiplying 132,840 * 4681.

Wait, 132,840 * 4000 = 531,360,000

132,840 * 600 = 79,704,000

132,840 * 80 = 10,627,200

132,840 * 1 = 132,840

Adding these:

531,360,000 + 79,704,000 = 611,064,000

611,064,000 + 10,627,200 = 621,691,200

621,691,200 + 132,840 = 621,824,040

So, numerator is 621,824,040

Divide by 30: 621,824,040 ÷ 30 = 20,727,468

So, that's correct. Therefore, sum_{n=1}^{40}n⁴ = 20,727,468

Therefore, sum_{n=3}^{40}n⁴ = 20,727,468 - 1 - 16 = 20,727,451

So that part is correct.

Similarly, sum_{n=1}^{40}n³ = [40*41/2]^2 = 820² = 672,400

sum_{n=3}^{40}n³ = 672,400 - 1 - 8 = 672,391

Correct.

sum_{n=3}^{40}n² = 22140 - 1 - 4 = 22135

Correct.

sum_{n=3}^{40}n = 820 - 1 - 2 = 817

Wait, hold on! Earlier, I thought sum_{n=1}^{40}n = 820, so sum_{n=3}^{40}n = 820 - 1 - 2 = 817, right? But earlier, I wrote 21318, which is incorrect.

Wait, that's a big mistake.

Wait, hold on, sum_{n=1}^{40}n = (40*41)/2 = 820

Therefore, sum_{n=3}^{40}n = sum_{n=1}^{40}n - 1 - 2 = 820 - 3 = 817

Similarly, sum_{n=1}^{40}n³ = 672,400

sum_{n=3}^{40}n³ = 672,400 - 1 - 8 = 672,391

sum_{n=1}^{40}n² = (40*41*81)/6 = 22140

sum_{n=3}^{40}n² = 22140 - 1 - 4 = 22135

sum_{n=1}^{40}n⁴ = 20,727,468

sum_{n=3}^{40}n⁴ = 20,727,468 - 1 - 16 = 20,727,451

Therefore, putting back into S:

S = (1/8)[20,727,451 - 2*672,391 - 22,135 + 2*817]

Compute each term:

20,727,451

- 2*672,391 = -1,344,782

- 22,135

+ 2*817 = +1,634

So, compute:

20,727,451 - 1,344,782 = 19,382,669

19,382,669 - 22,135 = 19,360,534

19,360,534 + 1,634 = 19,362,168

Therefore, S = 19,362,168 / 8

Compute 19,362,168 ÷ 8:

19,362,168 ÷ 8 = 2,420,271

Because 8*2,420,271 = 19,362,168

Therefore, S = 2,420,271

So, the sum S is 2,420,271

Therefore, we need to find 2,420,271 mod 1000

To find the remainder when 2,420,271 is divided by 1000, we look at the last three digits.

2,420,271 -> last three digits are 271

Therefore, the remainder is 271.

Wait, but let me confirm:

2,420,271 ÷ 1000 = 2,420 with a remainder of 271.

Yes, so 2,420,271 mod 1000 is 271.

Therefore, the answer is 271.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{271}
</think>

To solve the problem of finding the remainder when the sum \(\binom{\binom{n}{2}}{2} + \binom{\binom{n}{2}}{2} + \dots + \binom{\binom{40}{2}}{2}\) is divided by 1000, we start by understanding the binomial coefficient expressions involved.

The binomial coefficient \(\binom{\binom{n}{2}}{2}\) can be expanded as:
\[
\binom{\binom{n}{2}}{2} = \frac{\left(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\right)\left(\frac{n(n-1)}{2} - 1\right)}{2}
\]
Simplifying this expression, we get:
\[
\binom{\binom{n}{2}}{2} = \frac{n^2(n-1)^2 - 2n(n-1)}{8}
\]
This can be further factored as:
\[
\binom{\binom{n}{2}}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)(n^2 - n - 2)}{8} = \frac{n(n-1)(n-2)(n+1)}{8}
\]

We need to compute the sum \(S\) from \(n=3\) to \(n=40\):
\[
S = \sum_{n=3}^{40} \binom{\binom{n}{2}}{2}
\]

We express this sum as:
\[
S = \frac{1}{8} \sum_{n=3}^{40} \left(n^4 - 2n^3 - n^2 + 2n\right)
\]

We compute each part of the sum separately using known formulas and results:
- The sum of squares and cubes for the range from 1 to 40.
- Subtracting the contributions from \(n=1\) and \(n=2\).

After detailed calculations, we find:
- The sum of fourth powers from 3 to 40.
- The sum of cubes from 3 to 40.
- The sum of squares from 3 to 40.
- The sum of linear terms from 3 to 40.

Combining these results, we compute:
\[
S = \frac{1}{8} \left(20,727,451 - 2 \times 672,391 - 22,135 + 2 \times 817\right)
\]
Simplifying inside the brackets, we find:
\[
S = \frac{19,362,168}{8} = 2,420,271
\]

Finally, we find the remainder when 2,420,271 is divided by 1000, which is the last three digits:
\[
2,420,271 \mod 1000 = 271
\]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{271}
\]
