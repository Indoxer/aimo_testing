 The problem: 
Let $S$ be the set of all rational numbers that can be expressed as a repeating decimal in the form $0.\overline{abcd},$ where at least one of the digits $a,$ $b,$ $c,$ or $d$ is nonzero. Let $N$ be the number of distinct numerators obtained when numbers in $S$ are written as fractions in lowest terms. For example, both $4$ and $410$ are counted among the distinct numerators for numbers in $S$ because $0.\overline{3636} = \frac{4}{11}$ and $0.\overline{1230} = \frac{410}{3333}.$ Find the remainder when $N$ is divided by $1000.$


To solve this problem, we first need to understand the structure of the repeating decimals in the set \( S \). A number in the form \( 0.\overline{abcd} \) can be expressed as a fraction. Specifically, if \( x = 0.\overline{abcd} \), then \( x = \frac{abcd}{9999} \), where \( abcd \) is the four-digit number formed by the digits \( a, b, c, \) and \( d \).

Since \( abcd \) is a four-digit number, it ranges from 0000 to 9999. However, we are only interested in the cases where at least one of the digits is nonzero, so we exclude 0000. This means there are \( 9999 - 1 = 9998 \) possible values for \( abcd \).

Next, we need to determine how many distinct numerators appear when these fractions are in their lowest terms. The fraction \( \frac{abcd}{9999} \) will be in its lowest terms if and only if the greatest common divisor (gcd) of \( abcd \) and 9999 is 1. Therefore, we need to count the number of integers from 1 to 9999 that are coprime with 9999.

The prime factorization of 9999 is \( 9999 = 3^2 \times 11 \times 101 \). Using Euler's totient function \( \phi \), which counts the number of integers up to \( n \) that are coprime with \( n \), we have:
\[
\phi(9999) = 9999 \left(1 - \frac{1}{3}\right)\left(1 - \frac{1}{11}\right)\left(1 - \frac{1}{101}\right) = 9999 \cdot \frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{10}{11} \cdot \frac{100}{101} = 6000.
\]
Thus, there are 6000 integers from 1 to 9999 that are coprime with 9999. These are the numerators of the fractions in their lowest terms.

Finally, we need to find the remainder when 6000 is divided by 1000. Clearly, \( 6000 \mod 1000 = 0 \).

Therefore, the remainder when \( N \) is divided by 1000 is \(\boxed{0}\).
