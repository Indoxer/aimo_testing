 The problem: 
Let $S$ be the set of all rational numbers that can be expressed as a repeating decimal in the form $0.\overline{abcd},$ where at least one of the digits $a,$ $b,$ $c,$ or $d$ is nonzero. Let $N$ be the number of distinct numerators obtained when numbers in $S$ are written as fractions in lowest terms. For example, both $4$ and $410$ are counted among the distinct numerators for numbers in $S$ because $0.\overline{3636} = \frac{4}{11}$ and $0.\overline{1230} = \frac{410}{3333}.$ Find the remainder when $N$ is divided by $1000.$


To solve the problem, we first need to understand the structure of the repeating decimals in the set \( S \). A number in \( S \) can be expressed as \( 0.\overline{abcd} \), which means it is a repeating decimal with a period of 4 digits. Any such number can be written as a fraction of the form \( \frac{n}{9999} \), where \( n \) is an integer between 0 and 9999 (inclusive), and \( n \) is not zero (since at least one of the digits \( a, b, c, d \) is nonzero).

The fraction \( \frac{n}{9999} \) is in its lowest terms if and only if the greatest common divisor (gcd) of \( n \) and 9999 is 1. Therefore, we need to count the number of integers \( n \) from 1 to 9999 that are coprime to 9999.

First, we factorize 9999:
\[ 9999 = 3^2 \times 11 \times 101. \]
An integer \( n \) is coprime to 9999 if it is not divisible by 3, 11, or 101. We use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to count the number of such integers.

The number of integers from 1 to 9999 that are divisible by 3 is \( \left\lfloor \frac{9999}{3} \right\rfloor = 3333 \).
The number of integers from 1 to 9999 that are divisible by 11 is \( \left\lfloor \frac{9999}{11} \right\rfloor = 909 \).
The number of integers from 1 to 9999 that are divisible by 101 is \( \left\lfloor \frac{9999}{101} \right\rfloor = 99 \).
The number of integers from 1 to 9999 that are divisible by 33 is \( \left\lfloor \frac{9999}{33} \right\rfloor = 303 \).
The number of integers from 1 to 9999 that are divisible by 333 is \( \left\lfloor \frac{9999}{333} \right\rfloor = 30 \).
The number of integers from 1 to 9999 that are divisible by 1113 is \( \left\lfloor \frac{9999}{1113} \right\rfloor = 9 \).
The number of integers from 1 to 9999 that are divisible by 10101 is \( \left\lfloor \frac{9999}{10101} \right\rfloor = 0 \).

By the principle of inclusion-exclusion, the number of integers from 1 to 9999 that are divisible by 3, 11, or 101 is:
\[ 3333 + 909 + 99 - 303 - 30 - 9 = 3999. \]
Therefore, the number of integers from 1 to 9999 that are coprime to 9999 is:
\[ 9999 - 3999 = 6000. \]

Thus, the number of distinct numerators obtained when numbers in \( S \) are written as fractions in lowest terms is 6000. The remainder when 6000 is divided by 1000 is:
\[ \boxed{000}. \]
