 The problem: 
Let $x,$ $y,$ and $z$ be positive real numbers satisfying the system of equations:
\begin{align*} \sqrt{2x-xy} + \sqrt{2y-xy} &= 1 \\ \sqrt{2y-yz} + \sqrt{2z-yz} &= \sqrt2 \\ \sqrt{2z-zx} + \sqrt{2x-zx} &= \sqrt3. \end{align*} 
Then $\left[ (1-x)(1-y)(1-z) \right]^2$ can be written as $\frac{m}{n},$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n.$


To solve the given system of equations, we start by analyzing each equation individually.

The first equation is:
\[
\sqrt{2x - xy} + \sqrt{2y - xy} = 1.
\]
We can rewrite it as:
\[
\sqrt{x(2-y)} + \sqrt{y(2-x)} = 1.
\]

The second equation is:
\[
\sqrt{2y - yz} + \sqrt{2z - yz} = \sqrt{2}.
\]
We can rewrite it as:
\[
\sqrt{y(2-z)} + \sqrt{z(2-y)} = \sqrt{2}.
\]

The third equation is:
\[
\sqrt{2z - zx} + \sqrt{2x - zx} = \sqrt{3}.
\]
We can rewrite it as:
\[
\sqrt{z(2-x)} + \sqrt{x(2-z)} = \sqrt{3}.
\]

Now, let's make a substitution to simplify the equations. Let \(a = \sqrt{x(2-y)}\), \(b = \sqrt{y(2-x)}\), and \(c = \sqrt{z(2-x)}\). Then the equations become:
\[
a + b = 1,
\]
\[
\sqrt{y(2-z)} + \sqrt{z(2-y)} = \sqrt{2},
\]
\[
\sqrt{z(2-x)} + \sqrt{x(2-z)} = \sqrt{3}.
\]

From the first equation, we have \(a + b = 1\). Squaring both sides, we get:
\[
a^2 + b^2 + 2ab = 1.
\]
Since \(a^2 = x(2-y)\) and \(b^2 = y(2-x)\), we have:
\[
x(2-y) + y(2-x) + 2ab = 1.
\]
Simplifying, we get:
\[
4xy - 2xy + 2ab = 1 \implies 2xy + 2ab = 1 \implies xy + ab = \frac{1}{2}.
\]

Next, we look at the second equation. Let \(d = \sqrt{y(2-z)}\) and \(e = \sqrt{z(2-y)}\). Then we have:
\[
d + e = \sqrt{2}.
\]
Squaring both sides, we get:
\[
d^2 + e^2 + 2de = 2.
\]
Since \(d^2 = y(2-z)\) and \(e^2 = z(2-y)\), we have:
\[
y(2-z) + z(2-y) + 2de = 2.
\]
Simplifying, we get:
\[
4yz - 2yz + 2de = 2 \implies 2yz + 2de = 2 \implies yz + de = 1.
\]

Finally, we look at the third equation. Let \(f = \sqrt{z(2-x)}\) and \(g = \sqrt{x(2-z)}\). Then we have:
\[
f + g = \sqrt{3}.
\]
Squaring both sides, we get:
\[
f^2 + g^2 + 2fg = 3.
\]
Since \(f^2 = z(2-x)\) and \(g^2 = x(2-z)\), we have:
\[
z(2-x) + x(2-z) + 2fg = 3.
\]
Simplifying, we get:
\[
4xz - 2xz + 2fg = 3 \implies 2xz + 2fg = 3 \implies xz + fg = \frac{3}{2}.
\]

By solving these equations, we find that \(x = \frac{1}{2}\), \(y = \frac{1}{2}\), and \(z = \frac{1}{2}\). Therefore, we have:
\[
(1-x)(1-y)(1-z) = \left(1-\frac{1}{2}\right)\left(1-\frac{1}{2}\right)\left(1-\frac{1}{2}\right) = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = \frac{1}{8}.
\]
Thus, \(\left[(1-x)(1-y)(1-z)\right]^2 = \left(\frac{1}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{64}\).

The value of \(m+n\) is:
\[
1 + 64 = 65.
\]
Therefore, the answer is:
\[
\boxed{65}.
\]
