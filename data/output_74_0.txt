 The problem: 
Let $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ be point on the hyperbola $\frac{x^2}{20}- \frac{y^2}{24} = 1$ such that $ABCD$ is a rhombus whose diagonals intersect at the origin. Find the greatest real number that is less than $BD^2$ for all such rhombi.


</think>

Alright, so I have this problem where there are four points \( A \), \( B \), \( C \), and \( D \) on the hyperbola \( \frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \). These points form a rhombus \( ABCD \), and the diagonals of this rhombus intersect at the origin. My goal is to find the greatest real number that is less than \( BD^2 \) for all such rhombi.

First, let me recall some properties of hyperbolas and rhombuses. The given hyperbola is centered at the origin, with its transverse axis along the x-axis. For such a hyperbola, any point \( (x, y) \) on it satisfies \( \frac{x^2}{a^2} - \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1 \), where \( a^2 = 20 \) and \( b^2 = 24 \).

Since \( ABCD \) is a rhombus with diagonals intersecting at the origin, the diagonals must bisect each other. Let’s denote the diagonals as \( AC \) and \( BD \). Because they intersect at the origin, the coordinates of the vertices can be expressed in terms of vectors from the origin.

Let’s assume that diagonal \( AC \) has endpoints \( (p, q) \) and \( (-p, -q) \), and diagonal \( BD \) has endpoints \( (r, s) \) and \( (-r, -s) \). Since all four points lie on the hyperbola, they must satisfy the hyperbola equation.

So, for point \( (p, q) \):
\[
\frac{p^2}{20} - \frac{q^2}{24} = 1
\]
Similarly, for point \( (r, s) \):
\[
\frac{r^2}{20} - \frac{s^2}{24} = 1
\]

Now, since \( ABCD \) is a rhombus, all sides are equal in length. This implies that the distances between consecutive points are equal. Let's calculate the distance between \( (p, q) \) and \( (r, s) \), which should be equal to the distance between \( (r, s) \) and \( (-p, -q) \), and so on.

The distance squared between \( (p, q) \) and \( (r, s) \) is:
\[
(p - r)^2 + (q - s)^2
\]
And the distance squared between \( (r, s) \) and \( (-p, -q) \) is:
\[
(r + p)^2 + (s + q)^2
\]
Setting these equal gives:
\[
(p - r)^2 + (q - s)^2 = (r + p)^2 + (s + q)^2
\]
Expanding both sides:
\[
p^2 - 2pr + r^2 + q^2 - 2qs + s^2 = r^2 + 2pr + p^2 + s^2 + 2qs + q^2
\]
Simplifying:
\[
-2pr - 2qs = 2pr + 2qs
\]
\[
-4pr - 4qs = 0
\]
Dividing both sides by -4:
\[
pr + qs = 0
\]
This equation tells us that the dot product of vectors \( (p, q) \) and \( (r, s) \) is zero, meaning they are perpendicular to each other. So, the diagonals \( AC \) and \( BD \) are perpendicular.

Given that, we can use the property of rhombuses that the area is half the product of the lengths of the diagonals. However, our main focus is on \( BD^2 \).

To find \( BD^2 \), note that \( BD \) is the distance between \( (r, s) \) and \( (-r, -s) \), which is:
\[
BD^2 = (2r)^2 + (2s)^2 = 4r^2 + 4s^2
\]
So, we need to minimize \( BD^2 = 4(r^2 + s^2) \) subject to the constraint that \( \frac{r^2}{20} - \frac{s^2}{24} = 1 \).

Let’s express \( r^2 \) in terms of \( s^2 \):
\[
\frac{r^2}{20} = 1 + \frac{s^2}{24}
\]
\[
r^2 = 20\left(1 + \frac{s^2}{24}\right) = 20 + \frac{20s^2}{24} = 20 + \frac{5s^2}{6}
\]
Substituting into \( BD^2 \):
\[
BD^2 = 4\left(20 + \frac{5s^2}{6} + s^2\right) = 4\left(20 + \frac{11s^2}{6}\right) = 80 + \frac{44s^2}{6} = 80 + \frac{22s^2}{3}
\]
To minimize \( BD^2 \), we need to minimize \( s^2 \). However, \( s^2 \) cannot be zero because then the points would coincide, which isn't possible for a rhombus. 

But wait, actually, since \( pr + qs = 0 \) and \( p^2/20 - q^2/24 = 1 \), there might be constraints on \( r \) and \( s \) beyond just the hyperbola equation.

Let me reconsider. From \( pr + qs = 0 \), we can express \( p = -\frac{qs}{r} \). Substituting into the hyperbola equation for \( (p, q) \):
\[
\frac{\left(-\frac{qs}{r}\right)^2}{20} - \frac{q^2}{24} = 1
\]
\[
\frac{q^2s^2}{20r^2} - \frac{q^2}{24} = 1
\]
Factor out \( q^2 \):
\[
q^2\left(\frac{s^2}{20r^2} - \frac{1}{24}\right) = 1
\]
From the hyperbola equation for \( (r, s) \), we have:
\[
\frac{r^2}{20} - \frac{s^2}{24} = 1
\]
Let’s solve for \( \frac{s^2}{24} \):
\[
\frac{s^2}{24} = \frac{r^2}{20} - 1
\]
So,
\[
\frac{s^2}{20r^2} = \frac{1}{20r^2} \cdot s^2 = \frac{1}{20r^2} \cdot 24\left(\frac{r^2}{20} - 1\right) = \frac{24}{20r^2} \cdot \left(\frac{r^2}{20} - 1\right)
\]
Simplify:
\[
= \frac{6}{5r^2} \cdot \left(\frac{r^2}{20} - 1\right) = \frac{6}{5r^2} \cdot \frac{r^2 - 20}{20} = \frac{6(r^2 - 20)}{100r^2} = \frac{3(r^2 - 20)}{50r^2}
\]
Substitute back into the earlier equation:
\[
q^2\left(\frac{3(r^2 - 20)}{50r^2} - \frac{1}{24}\right) = 1
\]
Find a common denominator for the terms inside the parentheses:
\[
\frac{3(r^2 - 20)}{50r^2} - \frac{1}{24} = \frac{72(r^2 - 20) - 25r^2}{1200r^2} = \frac{72r^2 - 1440 - 25r^2}{1200r^2} = \frac{47r^2 - 1440}{1200r^2}
\]
So, the equation becomes:
\[
q^2 \cdot \frac{47r^2 - 1440}{1200r^2} = 1
\]
Thus,
\[
q^2 = \frac{1200r^2}{47r^2 - 1440}
\]
Since \( q^2 \) must be positive, the denominator must also be positive:
\[
47r^2 - 1440 > 0 \implies r^2 > \frac{1440}{47} \approx 30.638
\]
Therefore, \( r^2 > \frac{1440}{47} \).

Recall that \( BD^2 = 4(r^2 + s^2) \). We need to express \( s^2 \) in terms of \( r^2 \) using the hyperbola equation:
\[
\frac{r^2}{20} - \frac{s^2}{24} = 1 \implies s^2 = 24\left(\frac{r^2}{20} - 1\right) = \frac{24r^2}{20} - 24 = \frac{6r^2}{5} - 24
\]
So,
\[
BD^2 = 4\left(r^2 + \frac{6r^2}{5} - 24\right) = 4\left(\frac{11r^2}{5} - 24\right) = \frac{44r^2}{5} - 96
\]
We need to minimize \( BD^2 \), so we should find the minimum value of \( \frac{44r^2}{5} - 96 \) given that \( r^2 > \frac{1440}{47} \).

Since \( \frac{44}{5} \) is positive, the expression \( \frac{44r^2}{5} - 96 \) increases as \( r^2 \) increases. Therefore, the minimum occurs when \( r^2 \) is at its smallest allowed value, which is \( \frac{1440}{47} \).

Substitute \( r^2 = \frac{1440}{47} \) into \( BD^2 \):
\[
BD^2 = \frac{44}{5} \cdot \frac{1440}{47} - 96 = \frac{44 \times 1440}{5 \times 47} - 96 = \frac{63360}{235} - 96
\]
Simplify \( \frac{63360}{235} \):
\[
\frac{63360}{235} = 269.787...
\]
Then,
\[
BD^2 = 269.787... - 96 = 173.787...
\]
So, the minimal \( BD^2 \) is approximately \( 173.787 \). However, since the problem asks for the greatest real number less than \( BD^2 \) for all such rhombi, we need the infimum of \( BD^2 \), which is \( \frac{63360}{235} - 96 \).

Let me compute this exactly:
\[
\frac{63360}{235} - 96 = \frac{63360 - 96 \times 235}{235} = \frac{63360 - 22680}{235} = \frac{40680}{235}
\]
Simplify \( \frac{40680}{235} \):
Divide numerator and denominator by 5:
\[
\frac{8136}{47} \approx 173.085...
\]
Wait, but earlier calculation gave approximately 173.787. There seems to be a discrepancy here. Let me double-check the calculations.

Starting again:
\[
BD^2 = \frac{44r^2}{5} - 96
\]
With \( r^2 = \frac{1440}{47} \),
\[
BD^2 = \frac{44}{5} \times \frac{1440}{47} - 96 = \frac{44 \times 1440}{5 \times 47} - 96 = \frac{63360}{235} - 96
\]
Convert 96 to a fraction over 235:
\[
96 = \frac{96 \times 235}{235} = \frac{22680}{235}
\]
So,
\[
BD^2 = \frac{63360 - 22680}{235} = \frac{40680}{235}
\]
Simplify \( \frac{40680}{235} \):
Divide numerator and denominator by 5:
\[
\frac{8136}{47} \approx 173.085
\]
Wait, this contradicts my previous approximate calculation. Let me check the arithmetic.

\( 63360 - 22680 = 40680 \). Correct.

\( 40680 ÷ 235 \):

Calculate \( 235 × 173 = 235 × 170 + 235 × 3 = 39950 + 705 = 40655 \).

Subtract: \( 40680 - 40655 = 25 \).

So, \( \frac{40680}{235} = 173 + \frac{25}{235} = 173 + \frac{5}{47} \approx 173 + 0.106 = 173.106 \).

Thus, \( BD^2 \) is exactly \( \frac{8136}{47} \) or approximately 173.106.

However, the question asks for the greatest real number less than \( BD^2 \) for all such rhombi. Since \( BD^2 \) can be as small as \( \frac{8136}{47} \), the supremum of numbers less than \( BD^2 \) across all rhombi is just below \( \frac{8136}{47} \).

But wait, actually, as \( r^2 \) approaches \( \frac{1440}{47} \) from above, \( BD^2 \) approaches \( \frac{8136}{47} \). Therefore, the greatest real number less than \( BD^2 \) for all such rhombi is the infimum of \( BD^2 \), which is \( \frac{8136}{47} \).

But \( \frac{8136}{47} \) simplifies as follows:

Divide 8136 by 47:

47 × 173 = 8131 (since 47 × 170 = 7990, plus 47 × 3 = 141, totaling 8131).

So, \( \frac{8136}{47} = 173 + \frac{5}{47} \).

Thus, the exact value is \( 173 \frac{5}{47} \).

Therefore, the greatest real number less than \( BD^2 \) for all such rhombi is \( \boxed{\frac{8136}{47}} \).

**Final Answer**
The greatest real number less than \( BD^2 \) for all such rhombi is \boxed{\dfrac{8136}{47}}.
</think>

Given the hyperbola \(\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1\) and a rhombus \(ABCD\) with diagonals intersecting at the origin, we need to find the greatest real number less than \(BD^2\) for all such rhombi.

1. **Hyperbola Equation**: Points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) lie on the hyperbola, so they satisfy \(\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1\).

2. **Rhombus Properties**: The diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\) intersect at the origin and are perpendicular. The coordinates of the vertices are \((p, q)\), \((-p, -q)\), \((r, s)\), and \((-r, -s)\).

3. **Dot Product Condition**: The diagonals being perpendicular implies \(pr + qs = 0\).

4. **Expressing \(BD^2\)**: The length of \(BD\) is \(2\sqrt{r^2 + s^2}\), so \(BD^2 = 4(r^2 + s^2)\).

5. **Hyperbola Constraint**: Using the hyperbola equation for points \((r, s)\), we have \(\frac{r^2}{20} - \frac{s^2}{24} = 1\).

6. **Minimizing \(BD^2\)**: Express \(s^2\) in terms of \(r^2\): \(s^2 = \frac{6r^2}{5} - 24\). Substitute into \(BD^2\):
   \[
   BD^2 = 4\left(r^2 + \frac{6r^2}{5} - 24\right) = \frac{44r^2}{5} - 96
   \]

7. **Finding Minimum Value**: The minimum value of \(r^2\) is \(\frac{1440}{47}\). Substituting this into the expression for \(BD^2\):
   \[
   BD^2 = \frac{44}{5} \cdot \frac{1440}{47} - 96 = \frac{8136}{47}
   \]

Thus, the greatest real number less than \(BD^2\) for all such rhombi is \(\boxed{\dfrac{8136}{47}}\).
