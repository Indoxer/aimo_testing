 The problem: 
Azar, Carl, Jon, and Sergey are the four players left in a singles tennis tournament. They are randomly assigned opponents in the semifinal matches, and the winners of those matches play each other in the final match to determine the winner of the tournament. When Azar plays Carl, Azar will win the match with probability $\frac23$. When either Azar or Carl plays either Jon or Sergey, Azar or Carl will win the match with probability $\frac34$. Assume that outcomes of different matches are independent. The probability that Carl will win the tournament is $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$.


Alright, so I have this probability problem to solve about a tennis tournament. Let me read it again and try to break it down.

We've got four players: Azar, Carl, Jon, and Sergey. They're in the semifinals, which means they'll be paired up into two matches. The winners of those semifinal matches will then play each other in the final to decide the tournament winner. 

The problem gives me some probabilities:
- When Azar plays Carl, Azar wins with probability 2/3.
- When either Azar or Carl plays against Jon or Sergey, the Azar/Carl player has a 3/4 chance of winning.

All right, so first off, we need to figure out the probability that Carl wins the tournament. They mention that outcomes of different matches are independent, which is important because it means we can multiply probabilities without worrying about dependencies.

So, let's think about the structure of the tournament. In the semifinals, there are two matches. The initial pairing is random, so we need to consider all possible ways to pair these four players. Then, depending on who Carl plays in the semifinal, his chances of winning the tournament vary.

First, let's figure out how many possible semifinal pairings there are. We have four players: Azar (A), Carl (C), Jon (J), and Sergey (S). The number of ways to pair them is 3, since once you fix one person's opponent, the rest are determined. But wait, actually, the number of ways to partition four players into two pairs is 3. For example, if A is paired with C, then J and S are paired; if A is paired with J, then C and S are paired; if A is paired with S, then C and J are paired. So, three possible semifinal pairings.

But maybe another way to look at it is considering that the pairings are equally likely? Hmm, no, actually, the initial assignment is random, but the pairings aren't necessarily equally likely because some matchups might be more probable based on the given probabilities.

Wait, hold on. Let me clarify: the problem says "randomly assigned opponents," so each possible semifinal matchup is equally likely. So, we have three possible pairings, each with equal probability of 1/3.

But is that correct? Wait, actually, when assigning opponents, the number of possible pairings is 3, yes, but sometimes people consider the total number of ways as 4!/(2!2!) = 6, but since the order of the pairs doesn't matter, it's 3. So yeah, each of the three possible pairings has a probability of 1/3.

Therefore, we have three cases for the semifinal pairings:

1. Azar vs. Carl and Jon vs. Sergey
2. Azar vs. Jon and Carl vs. Sergey
3. Azar vs. Sergey and Carl vs. Jon

Each of these occurs with probability 1/3.

Now, for each case, we need to compute the probability that Carl wins the tournament and then combine them using the law of total probability.

Let me outline each case:

**Case 1: Azar vs. Carl and Jon vs. Sergey**

In this case, Carl is playing Azar in the semifinal. So, the probability that Carl wins his semifinal is 2/3. If he loses, he can't win the tournament, so we only need to consider him winning his semifinal.

If Carl beats Azar (prob 2/3), he moves on to the final. Now, in the final, he will face whoever wins between Azar and the other semifinalist, which is Jon vs. Sergey. So, the final opponent could be Jon or Sergey.

What's the probability that Jon or Sergey wins their semifinal? Since Jon and Sergey are playing each other, and both have a certain probability of winning. However, looking back at the problem statement, when either Azar or Carl plays Jon or Sergey, the Azar/Carl player has a 3/4 chance of winning. But in this case, it's Jon vs. Sergey. What's the probability that Jon wins?

Hmm, the problem doesn't specify any particular probability when Jon plays Sergey. It only gives probabilities when Azar or Carl plays Jon or Sergey. So, perhaps we can assume that when Jon plays Sergey, each has an equal chance of winning, i.e., 1/2 each.

Is that a valid assumption? Well, the problem doesn't provide any information about Jon vs. Sergey, so unless stated otherwise, we might have to assume that it's a fair match, so each has a 50% chance.

Alternatively, perhaps it's implied that Jon and Sergey are equally strong, so they each have a 1/2 chance. That seems reasonable.

So, in the final, Carl will face either Jon or Sergey, each with probability 1/2. Since the final is just one match, regardless of who he faces, the probability that Carl wins the final is dependent on his probability against each opponent.

Wait, but the problem states that when Azar or Carl plays Jon or Sergey, the Azar/Carl player has a 3/4 chance. So, in the final, Carl will be playing either Jon or Sergey, each of whom he has a 3/4 chance against.

Therefore, in this case, after beating Azar in the semifinal (with probability 2/3), Carl has a 3/4 chance of winning the final, regardless of whether it's Jon or Sergey. So, the probability that Carl wins the tournament in this scenario is (2/3) * (3/4) = 1/2.

But wait, actually, no. Because if Carl is facing Jon or Sergey, each with a 3/4 chance of Carl winning. But the opponent isn't fixed yet—it's determined by Jon vs. Sergey.

So, first, we need to find the probability that Carl gets to the final, which is 2/3, and then the probability that he wins the final is 3/4, regardless of who he plays. So, multiplying those together: 2/3 * 3/4 = 1/2.

So, in Case 1, the probability that Carl wins the tournament is 1/2, and since this case happens with probability 1/3 overall, the contribution to the total probability is (1/3)*(1/2) = 1/6.

Wait, hold on, is that correct? Let me double-check.

No, actually, the 1/2 is conditional on Case 1 occurring. So, the overall probability contributed by Case 1 is P(Case 1) * P(Carl wins tournament | Case 1) = (1/3) * (2/3 * 3/4) = (1/3)*(1/2) = 1/6. Yeah, that's correct.

**Case 2: Azar vs. Jon and Carl vs. Sergey**

In this case, Carl is playing Sergey in the semifinal. So, the probability that Carl wins his semifinal is... well, when Carl plays Sergey, the probability Carl wins is 3/4, as per the given data.

If Carl beats Sergey (prob 3/4), he moves on to the final. Now, in the other semifinal, Azar is playing Jon. So, what's the probability that Azar wins his semifinal? Since Azar vs. Jon is not specified in the problem—wait, the problem says when Azar or Carl plays Jon or Sergey, the Azar/Carl player has a 3/4 chance. So, Azar vs. Jon is such a match, so Azar has a 3/4 chance of winning.

Thus, the probability that Azar wins his semifinal is 3/4, meaning Jon has a 1/4 chance.

So, in the final, Carl will face either Azar or Jon. Each with probability 3/4 and 1/4 respectively.

Now, if Carl plays Azar in the final, the probability that Carl wins is 2/3, as given.

If Carl plays Jon in the final, the probability that Carl wins is 3/4, since Azar/Carl vs. Jon/Sergey gives Carl 3/4 chance.

Therefore, the probability that Carl wins the tournament in this case is:

P(Carl wins final) = P(Carl vs. Azar) * P(Carl beats Azar) + P(Carl vs. Jon) * P(Carl beats Jon)
= (3/4) * (2/3) + (1/4) * (3/4)
= (6/12) + (3/16)
= Wait, let me compute that correctly.

Wait, 3/4 times 2/3 is (3*2)/(4*3) = 6/12 = 1/2.

And 1/4 times 3/4 is 3/16.

So, adding them together: 1/2 + 3/16 = 8/16 + 3/16 = 11/16.

Therefore, the probability that Carl wins the tournament given Case 2 is 11/16.

But wait, hold on—that can’t be right, because 1/2 is 8/16, plus 3/16 is 11/16. That seems high, but let's see.

But let me verify the steps again.

In Case 2, Carl plays Sergey in the semifinal, so he has a 3/4 chance to get to the final. If he does, he faces either Azar or Jon.

Azar has a 3/4 chance of winning his semifinal, so P(Azar in final) = 3/4, P(Jon in final) = 1 - 3/4 = 1/4.

Then, in the final, against Azar: Carl has 2/3 chance.

Against Jon: Carl has 3/4 chance.

Hence, overall:

(3/4)*(2/3) + (1/4)*(3/4) = (6/12) + (3/16) = (1/2) + (3/16) = 11/16. Yeah, that's correct.

So, the probability that Carl wins the tournament given Case 2 is 11/16, and since Case 2 occurs with probability 1/3, the contribution to the total probability is (1/3)*(11/16) = 11/48.

**Case 3: Azar vs. Sergey and Carl vs. Jon**

This is similar to Case 2, but with Sergey and Jon swapped.

So, in this case, Carl is playing Jon in the semifinal. Therefore, the probability that Carl wins his semifinal is 3/4, same as in Case 2.

If he wins, he moves on to the final. The other semifinal is Azar vs. Sergey. Again, since it's Azar vs. Sergey, which is an Azar/Carl vs. Jon/Sergey matchup, so Azar has a 3/4 chance of winning.

Therefore, in the final, Carl will face either Azar or Sergey.

Azar has a 3/4 chance, Sergey has a 1/4 chance.

Again, against Azar, Carl has a 2/3 chance; against Sergey, Carl has a 3/4 chance.

Therefore, the probability that Carl wins the tournament in this case is:

(3/4)*(2/3) + (1/4)*(3/4) = same as before, which is 11/16.

Therefore, similar to Case 2, the probability contributed by Case 3 is (1/3)*(11/16) = 11/48.

Now, putting it all together, the total probability that Carl wins the tournament is the sum of the contributions from each case:

Total P = P(Case1) + P(Case2) + P(Case3)
= (1/6) + (11/48) + (11/48)

First, convert 1/6 to 8/48, so:

Total P = 8/48 + 11/48 + 11/48 = (8 + 11 + 11)/48 = 30/48

Simplify 30/48: divide numerator and denominator by 6: 5/8.

So, the probability that Carl wins the tournament is 5/8.

Wait, 5/8? Let me check my calculations again because I feel like 5/8 is a bit high.

Wait, in Case 1, we had 1/6, which is approximately 0.1667.

In Cases 2 and 3, each gave us 11/48, which is approximately 0.2292 each.

Adding them up: 0.1667 + 0.2292 + 0.2292 ≈ 0.625, which is 5/8. So, that seems consistent.

But let me go through the steps again to make sure I didn't make any mistake.

Starting with Case 1: Azar vs. Carl and Jon vs. Sergey.

Probability Carl wins semifinal: 2/3.

Probability he wins final: 3/4.

Total: 2/3 * 3/4 = 1/2.

Contribution to total: 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6.

Case 2: Azar vs. Jon and Carl vs. Sergey.

Probability Carl wins semifinal: 3/4.

Probability he wins semifinal: 3/4.

Then, in the final, he can face Azar with 3/4 chance or Jon with 1/4 chance.

Probability he wins against Azar: 2/3.

Probability he wins against Jon: 3/4.

So, expected probability: (3/4)(2/3) + (1/4)(3/4) = (6/12) + (3/16) = (1/2) + (3/16) = 11/16.

Contribution to total: 1/3 * 11/16 = 11/48.

Similarly, Case 3 is symmetric to Case 2, so same calculation, 11/48.

Total P = 1/6 + 11/48 + 11/48.

Convert 1/6 to 8/48: 8 + 11 + 11 = 30 over 48, reduces to 5/8.

Yes, that seems correct.

So, the probability is 5/8, so p = 5, q = 8, p + q = 13.

Wait, hold on, 5 and 8 are coprime, so yeah, that should be the answer.

Just to recap, because sometimes when dealing with multiple cases, especially with conditional probabilities, it's easy to miss something, but in this case, I considered all three possible pairings, calculated the probability for each, multiplied by their respective probabilities, and added them up. It seems thorough.

Another thing to note is that Jon and Sergey were interchangeable in Cases 2 and 3, which is why both cases gave the same contribution. That makes sense because whether Carl plays Jon or Sergey in the semifinal, the result is symmetric in terms of probabilities.

So, yeah, I think 5/8 is correct. Thus, p + q = 5 + 8 = 13.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{13}
</think>

To determine the probability that Carl will win the tournament, we need to consider the different possible semifinal pairings and calculate the probability for each case.

1. **Case 1: Azar vs. Carl and Jon vs. Sergey**
   - Probability Carl wins the semifinal: \( \frac{2}{3} \)
   - Probability Carl wins the final: \( \frac{3}{4} \)
   - Contribution to total probability: \( \frac{1}{3} \times \left( \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{3}{4} \right) = \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{6} \)

2. **Case 2: Azar vs. Jon and Carl vs. Sergey**
   - Probability Carl wins the semifinal: \( \frac{3}{4} \)
   - Probability Azar wins his semifinal: \( \frac{3}{4} \)
   - Probability Jon wins his semifinal: \( \frac{1}{4} \)
   - Probability Carl wins the final against Azar: \( \frac{2}{3} \)
   - Probability Carl wins the final against Jon: \( \frac{3}{4} \)
   - Contribution to total probability: \( \frac{1}{3} \times \left( \left( \frac{3}{4} \times \frac{2}{3} \right) + \left( \frac{1}{4} \times \frac{3}{4} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{11}{16} = \frac{11}{48} \)

3. **Case 3: Azar vs. Sergey and Carl vs. Jon**
   - This case is symmetric to Case 2, so the contribution is the same: \( \frac{11}{48} \)

Summing the contributions from all cases:
- Total probability: \( \frac{1}{6} + \frac{11}{48} + \frac{11}{48} \)
- Convert \( \frac{1}{6} \) to \( \frac{8}{48} \): \( \frac{8}{48} + \frac{11}{48} + \frac{11}{48} = \frac{30}{48} = \frac{5}{8} \)

Thus, the probability that Carl wins the tournament is \( \frac{5}{8} \). Therefore, \( p = 5 \) and \( q = 8 \), giving \( p + q = 13 \).

\[
\boxed{13}
