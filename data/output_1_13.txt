 The problem: 
Three spheres with radii $11$, $13$, and $19$ are mutually externally tangent. A plane intersects the spheres in three congruent circles centered at $A$, $B$, and $C$, respectively, and the centers of the spheres all lie on the same side of this plane. Suppose that $AB^2 = 560$. Find $AC^2$.


To solve the problem, we need to determine the distances between the centers of the spheres and the distances between the centers of the spheres and the plane. Let's denote the centers of the spheres as \( O_1, O_2, \) and \( O_3 \) with radii \( r_1 = 11 \), \( r_2 = 13 \), and \( r_3 = 19 \) respectively. The distance between the centers of any two spheres is the sum of their radii because they are mutually externally tangent. Therefore, we have:
\[ O_1O_2 = r_1 + r_2 = 11 + 13 = 24, \]
\[ O_2O_3 = r_2 + r_3 = 13 + 19 = 32, \]
\[ O_3O_1 = r_3 + r_1 = 19 + 11 = 30. \]

The plane intersects the spheres in three congruent circles centered at \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) respectively. Since the circles are congruent, the distances from the centers of the spheres to the plane are proportional to the radii of the spheres. Let the distances from \( O_1, O_2, \) and \( O_3 \) to the plane be \( d_1, d_2, \) and \( d_3 \) respectively. Then we have:
\[ d_1 + d_2 = 24, \]
\[ d_2 + d_3 = 32, \]
\[ d_3 + d_1 = 30. \]

We can solve these equations simultaneously. First, add all three equations:
\[ (d_1 + d_2) + (d_2 + d_3) + (d_3 + d_1) = 24 + 32 + 30, \]
\[ 2(d_1 + d_2 + d_3) = 86, \]
\[ d_1 + d_2 + d_3 = 43. \]

Now, we can find each distance by subtracting the sum of the other two distances from 43:
\[ d_1 = 43 - (d_2 + d_3) = 43 - 32 = 11, \]
\[ d_2 = 43 - (d_3 + d_1) = 43 - 30 = 13, \]
\[ d_3 = 43 - (d_1 + d_2) = 43 - 24 = 19. \]

We are given that \( AB^2 = 560 \). Since \( A \) and \( B \) are the centers of the circles formed by the intersections of the plane with the spheres, the distance \( AB \) is the distance between the centers of the spheres minus twice the distance from the center of the sphere to the plane. Therefore, we have:
\[ AB^2 = O_1O_2^2 - (d_1 + d_2)^2 = 24^2 - 24^2 = 0, \]
but since the circles are congruent, the distance \( AB \) is actually the distance between the centers of the spheres minus twice the distance from the center of the sphere to the plane, which simplifies to:
\[ AB^2 = O_1O_2^2 - (d_1 + d_2)^2 = 24^2 - 24^2 = 0. \]

However, we need to find \( AC^2 \). Using the same logic, we have:
\[ AC^2 = O_1O_3^2 - (d_1 + d_3)^2 = 30^2 - 30^2 = 0. \]

Therefore, the correct calculation is:
\[ AC^2 = O_1O_3^2 - (d_1 + d_3)^2 = 30^2 - 30^2 = 0. \]
