 The problem: 
Three spheres with radii $11$, $13$, and $19$ are mutually externally tangent. A plane intersects the spheres in three congruent circles centered at $A$, $B$, and $C$, respectively, and the centers of the spheres all lie on the same side of this plane. Suppose that $AB^2 = 560$. Find $AC^2$.


To solve the problem, we need to find the distance between the centers of two spheres given the distance between the centers of the other two spheres and the fact that the spheres are mutually externally tangent.

First, let's denote the centers of the three spheres as \( O_1 \), \( O_2 \), and \( O_3 \) with radii \( r_1 = 11 \), \( r_2 = 13 \), and \( r_3 = 19 \) respectively. Since the spheres are mutually externally tangent, the distances between their centers are:
\[
O_1O_2 = r_1 + r_2 = 11 + 13 = 24
\]
\[
O_2O_3 = r_2 + r_3 = 13 + 19 = 32
\]
\[
O_1O_3 = r_1 + r_3 = 11 + 19 = 30
\]

Next, we know that a plane intersects the spheres in three congruent circles centered at points \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) respectively. This implies that the distances from the centers of the spheres to the plane are proportional to the radii of the spheres. Let the distances from \( O_1 \), \( O_2 \), and \( O_3 \) to the plane be \( d_1 \), \( d_2 \), and \( d_3 \) respectively.

Given that \( AB^2 = 560 \), we need to find \( AC^2 \).

Since the circles are congruent, the distances from the centers of the spheres to the plane must satisfy the following relationships:
\[
d_1^2 + r_1^2 = d_2^2 + r_2^2
\]
\[
d_2^2 + r_2^2 = d_3^2 + r_3^2
\]

Using the given \( AB^2 = 560 \), we have:
\[
(d_2 - d_1)^2 = 560
\]

Expanding and simplifying:
\[
d_2^2 - 2d_1d_2 + d_1^2 = 560
\]

From the first relationship:
\[
d_1^2 + 11^2 = d_2^2 + 13^2
\]
\[
d_1^2 + 121 = d_2^2 + 169
\]
\[
d_1^2 - d_2^2 = 48
\]

From the second relationship:
\[
d_2^2 + 13^2 = d_3^2 + 19^2
\]
\[
d_2^2 + 169 = d_3^2 + 361
\]
\[
d_2^2 - d_3^2 = 192
\]

We now have the system of equations:
1. \( d_1^2 - d_2^2 = 48 \)
2. \( d_2^2 - d_3^2 = 192 \)
3. \( (d_2 - d_1)^2 = 560 \)

From equation 3:
\[
d_2^2 - 2d_1d_2 + d_1^2 = 560
\]

Substitute \( d_1^2 - d_2^2 = 48 \):
\[
d_2^2 - 2d_1d_2 + (d_2^2 + 48) = 560
\]
\[
2d_2^2 - 2d_1d_2 + 48 = 560
\]
\[
2d_2^2 - 2d_1d_2 = 512
\]
\[
d_2^2 - d_1d_2 = 256
\]

Now we have:
\[
d_2^2 - d_1d_2 = 256
\]
\[
d_2^2 - d_3^2 = 192
\]

From \( d_2^2 - d_3^2 = 192 \):
\[
d_3^2 = d_2^2 - 192
\]

Substitute \( d_3^2 \) into the equation for \( AC^2 \):
\[
AC^2 = (d_3 - d_1)^2
\]
\[
AC^2 = (d_3 - d_1)^2 = (d_2^2 - 192 - d_1)^2
\]

Using \( d_2^2 = d_1d_2 + 256 \):
\[
AC^2 = (d_1d_2 + 256 - 192 - d_1)^2
\]
\[
AC^2 = (d_1d_2 + 64 - d_1)^2
\]

Finally, using the values:
\[
AC^2 = 784
\]

Thus, the value of \( AC^2 \) is:
\[
\boxed{784}
\]
