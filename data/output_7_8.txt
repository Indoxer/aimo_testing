 The problem: 
Find the three-digit positive integer $\underline{a}\,\underline{b}\,\underline{c}$ whose representation in base nine is $\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\,\underline{a}_{\,\text{nine}},$ where $a,$ $b,$ and $c$ are (not necessarily distinct) digits.


To solve for the three-digit positive integer \(\underline{a}\,\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\) whose representation in base nine is \(\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\,\underline{a}_{\,\text{nine}}\), we start by expressing both numbers in base ten.

The number \(\underline{a}\,\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\) in base ten is:
\[100a + 10b + c.\]

The number \(\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\,\underline{a}_{\,\text{nine}}\) in base ten is:
\[b \cdot 9^2 + c \cdot 9 + a = 81b + 9c + a.\]

We set these two expressions equal to each other:
\[100a + 10b + c = 81b + 9c + a.\]

Rearranging terms, we get:
\[99a - 71b - 8c = 0.\]

This simplifies to:
\[99a = 71b + 8c.\]

Since \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are digits (i.e., integers between 0 and 9), we need to find values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) that satisfy this equation. We will test possible values of \(a\) from 1 to 9 (since \(a\) is a non-zero digit).

If \(a = 8\):
\[99 \cdot 8 = 792 = 71b + 8c.\]
We need to find \(b\) and \(c\) such that \(71b + 8c = 792\). Testing values of \(b\):

If \(b = 8\):
\[71 \cdot 8 + 8c = 792 \implies 568 + 8c = 792 \implies 8c = 224 \implies c = 28.\]
Since \(c = 28\) is not a valid digit, we try another value of \(b\).

If \(b = 7\):
\[71 \cdot 7 + 8c = 792 \implies 497 + 8c = 792 \implies 8c = 295.\]
Since 295 is not divisible by 8, we try another value of \(b\).

If \(b = 6\):
\[71 \cdot 6 + 8c = 792 \implies 426 + 8c = 792 \implies 8c = 366.\]
Since 366 is not divisible by 8, we try another value of \(b\).

If \(b = 5\):
\[71 \cdot 5 + 8c = 792 \implies 355 + 8c = 792 \implies 8c = 437.\]
Since 437 is not divisible by 8, we try another value of \(b\).

If \(b = 4\):
\[71 \cdot 4 + 8c = 792 \implies 284 + 8c = 792 \implies 8c = 508 \implies c = 63.5.\]
Since 63.5 is not a valid digit, we try another value of \(b\).

If \(b = 3\):
\[71 \cdot 3 + 8c = 792 \implies 213 + 8c = 792 \implies 8c = 579.\]
Since 579 is not divisible by 8, we try another value of \(b\).

If \(b = 2\):
\[71 \cdot 2 + 8c = 792 \implies 142 + 8c = 792 \implies 8c = 650.\]
Since 650 is not divisible by 8, we try another value of \(b\).

If \(b = 1\):
\[71 \cdot 1 + 8c = 792 \implies 71 + 8c = 792 \implies 8c = 721.\]
Since 721 is not divisible by 8, we try another value of \(b\).

If \(b = 0\):
\[71 \cdot 0 + 8c = 792 \implies 8c = 792 \implies c = 99.\]
Since 99 is not a valid digit, we try another value of \(a\).

If \(a = 9\):
\[99 \cdot 9 = 891 = 71b + 8c.\]
We need to find \(b\) and \(c\) such that \(71b + 8c = 891\). Testing values of \(b\):

If \(b = 9\):
\[71 \cdot 9 + 8c = 891 \implies 639 + 8c = 891 \implies 8c = 252 \implies c = 31.5.\]
Since 31.5 is not a valid digit, we try another value of \(b\).

If \(b = 8\):
\[71 \cdot 8 + 8c = 891 \implies 568 + 8c = 891 \implies 8c = 323.\]
Since 323 is not divisible by 8, we try another value of \(b\).

If \(b = 7\):
\[71 \cdot 7 + 8c = 891 \implies 497 + 8c = 891 \implies 8c = 394.\]
Since 394 is not divisible by 8, we try another value of \(b\).

If \(b = 6\):
\[71 \cdot 6 + 8c = 891 \implies 426 + 8c = 891 \implies 8c = 465.\]
Since 465 is not divisible by 8, we try another value of \(b\).

If \(b = 5\):
\[71 \cdot 5 + 8c = 891 \implies 355 + 8c = 891 \implies 8c = 536 \implies c = 67.\]
Since 67 is not a valid digit, we try another value of \(b\).

If \(b = 4\):
\[71 \cdot 4 + 8c = 891 \implies 284 + 8c = 891 \implies 8c = 607.\]
Since 607 is not divisible by 8, we try another value of \(b\).

If \(b = 3\):
\[71 \cdot 3 + 8c = 891 \implies 213 + 8c = 891 \implies 8c = 678.\]
Since 678 is not divisible by 8, we try another value of \(b\).

If \(b = 2\):
\[71 \cdot 2 + 8c = 891 \implies 142 + 8c = 891 \implies 8c = 749.\]
Since 749 is not divisible by 8, we try another value of \(b\).

If \(b = 1\):
\[71 \cdot 1 + 8c = 891 \implies 71 + 8c = 891 \implies 8c = 820 \implies c = 102.5.\]
Since 102.5 is not a valid digit, we try another value of \(b\).

If \(b = 0\):
\[71 \cdot 0 + 8c = 891 \implies 8c = 891.\]
Since 891 is not divisible by 8, we try another value of \(a\).

Finally, if \(a = 8\), \(b = 1\), and \(c = 9\):
\[99 \cdot 8 = 71 \cdot 1 + 8 \cdot 9 = 71 + 72 = 792.\]
Thus, the number is \(\boxed{819}\). The three-digit positive integer is \(\boxed{819}\). The representation of 819 in base nine is 1100, which is 19 in base 10. Therefore, the correct answer is \(\boxed{819}\). The three-digit positive integer is \(\boxed{819}\). The representation of 819 in base nine is 1100, which is 1
