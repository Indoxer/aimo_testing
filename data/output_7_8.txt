 The problem: 
Find the three-digit positive integer $\underline{a}\,\underline{b}\,\underline{c}$ whose representation in base nine is $\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\,\underline{a}_{\,\text{nine}},$ where $a,$ $b,$ and $c$ are (not necessarily distinct) digits.


To find the three-digit positive integer \(\underline{a}\,\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\) whose representation in base nine is \(\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\,\underline{a}_{\,\text{nine}}\), we need to express both numbers in base ten and set them equal to each other.

First, let's express the number \(\underline{a}\,\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\) in base ten. The number \(\underline{a}\,\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\) can be written as:
\[ 100a + 10b + c. \]

Next, let's express the number \(\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\,\underline{a}_{\,\text{nine}}\) in base ten. The number \(\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\,\underline{a}_{\,\text{nine}}\) can be written as:
\[ b \cdot 9^2 + c \cdot 9^1 + a \cdot 9^0 = 81b + 9c + a. \]

Since these two expressions represent the same number, we can set them equal to each other:
\[ 100a + 10b + c = 81b + 9c + a. \]

Rearranging the terms, we get:
\[ 100a - a + 10b - 81b + c - 9c = 0, \]
\[ 99a - 71b - 8c = 0, \]
\[ 99a = 71b + 8c. \]

We need to find integer values for \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) that satisfy this equation, with the constraints that \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are digits (i.e., \(0 \leq a, b, c \leq 9\)) and \(a \neq 0\) because it is a three-digit number.

Let's test possible values for \(a\):

If \(a = 1\):
\[ 99 = 71b + 8c. \]
Since \(71b\) must be less than 99, \(b\) can only be 1 (because if \(b = 2\), \(71 \cdot 2 = 142\), which is greater than 99). So, we have:
\[ 99 = 71 \cdot 1 + 8c, \]
\[ 99 = 71 + 8c, \]
\[ 28 = 8c, \]
\[ c = 3.5. \]
Since \(c\) must be an integer, \(a = 1\) is not a solution.

If \(a = 2\):
\[ 198 = 71b + 8c. \]
Since \(71b\) must be less than 198, \(b\) can only be 2 (because if \(b = 3\), \(71 \cdot 3 = 213\), which is greater than 198). So, we have:
\[ 198 = 71 \cdot 2 + 8c, \]
\[ 198 = 142 + 8c, \]
\[ 56 = 8c, \]
\[ c = 7. \]
So, \(a = 2\), \(b = 2\), and \(c = 7\) is a solution.

We should check if there are any other solutions. If \(a = 3\):
\[ 297 = 71b + 8c. \]
Since \(71b\) must be less than 297, \(b\) can only be 4 (because if \(b = 5\), \(71 \cdot 5 = 355\), which is greater than 297). So, we have:
\[ 297 = 71 \cdot 4 + 8c, \]
\[ 297 = 284 + 8c, \]
\[ 13 = 8c, \]
\[ c = 1.625. \]
Since \(c\) must be an integer, \(a = 3\) is not a solution.

If \(a = 4\):
\[ 396 = 71b + 8c. \]
Since \(71b\) must be less than 396, \(b\) can only be 5 (because if \(b = 6\), \(71 \cdot 6 = 426\), which is greater than 396). So, we have:
\[ 396 = 71 \cdot 5 + 8c, \]
\[ 396 = 355 + 8c, \]
\[ 41 = 8c, \]
\[ c = 5.125. \]
Since \(c\) must be an integer, \(a = 4\) is not a solution.

If \(a = 5\):
\[ 495 = 71b + 8c. \]
Since \(71b\) must be less than 495, \(b\) can only be 7 (because if \(b = 8\), \(71 \cdot 8 = 568\), which is greater than 495). So, we have:
\[ 495 = 71 \cdot 7 + 8c, \]
\[ 495 = 497 + 8c, \]
\[ -2 = 8c, \]
\[ c = -0.25. \]
Since \(c\) must be a non-negative integer, \(a = 5\) is not a solution.

If \(a = 6\):
\[ 594 = 71b + 8c. \]
Since \(71b\) must be less than 594, \(b\) can only be 8 (because if \(b = 9\), \(71 \cdot 9 = 639\), which is greater than 594). So, we have:
\[ 594 = 71 \cdot 8 + 8c, \]
\[ 594 = 568 + 8c, \]
\[ 26 = 8c, \]
\[ c = 3.25. \]
Since \(c\) must be an integer, \(a = 6\) is not a solution.

If \(a = 7\):
\[ 693 = 71b + 8c. \]
Since \(71b\) must be less than 693, \(b\) can only be 9 (because if \(b = 10\), \(71 \cdot 10 = 710\), which is greater than 693). So, we have:
\[ 693 = 71 \cdot 9 + 8c, \]
\[ 693 = 639 + 8c, \]
\[ 54 = 8c, \]
\[ c = 6.75. \]
Since \(c\) must be an integer, \(a = 7\) is not a solution.

If \(a = 8\):
\[ 792 = 71b + 8c. \]
Since \(71b\) must be less than 792, \(b\) can only be 11 (because if \(b = 12\), \(71 \cdot 12 = 852\), which is greater than 792). So, we have:
\[ 792 = 71 \cdot 11 + 8c, \]
\[ 792 = 781 + 8c, \]
\[ 11 = 8c, \]
\[ c = 1.375. \]
Since \(c\) must be an integer, \(a = 8\) is not a solution.

If \(a = 9\):
\[ 891 = 71b + 8c. \]
Since \(71b\) must be less than 891, \(b\) can only be 12 (because if \(b = 13\), \(71 \cdot 13 = 923\), which is greater than 891). So, we have:
\[ 891 = 71 \cdot 12 + 8c, \]
\[ 891 = 852 + 8c, \]
\[ 39 = 8c, \]
\[ c = 4.875. \]
Since \(c\) must be an integer, \(a = 9\) is not a solution.

Therefore, the only solution is \(a = 2\), \(b = 2\), and \(c = 7\). The three-digit number is \(\boxed{227}\).
