 The problem: 
Let $S$ be the set of all rational numbers that can be expressed as a repeating decimal in the form $0.\overline{abcd},$ where at least one of the digits $a,$ $b,$ $c,$ or $d$ is nonzero. Let $N$ be the number of distinct numerators obtained when numbers in $S$ are written as fractions in lowest terms. For example, both $4$ and $410$ are counted among the distinct numerators for numbers in $S$ because $0.\overline{3636} = \frac{4}{11}$ and $0.\overline{1230} = \frac{410}{3333}.$ Find the remainder when $N$ is divided by $1000.$


To solve the problem, we first need to understand the structure of the repeating decimals in the set \( S \). A repeating decimal of the form \( 0.\overline{abcd} \) can be expressed as a fraction. Specifically, if we let \( x = 0.\overline{abcd} \), then

\[
x = \frac{abcd}{9999},
\]

where \( abcd \) represents the four-digit number formed by the digits \( a, b, c, \) and \( d \). This fraction can be simplified to its lowest terms by dividing the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor (gcd). The denominator 9999 factors as

\[
9999 = 3^2 \times 11 \times 101.
\]

Thus, the fraction \( \frac{abcd}{9999} \) will be in its lowest terms if and only if \( \gcd(abcd, 9999) = 1 \). The number \( abcd \) ranges from 1 to 9999, since \( abcd \) is a four-digit number (or less if it is zero).

We need to count the number of distinct numerators when these fractions are in their lowest terms. This is equivalent to counting the number of integers from 1 to 9999 that are coprime to 9999. This count is given by Euler's totient function \( \phi(9999) \).

The totient function \( \phi(n) \) for \( n = p_1^{k_1} p_2^{k_2} \cdots p_m^{k_m} \) is calculated as

\[
\phi(n) = n \left(1 - \frac{1}{p_1}\right)\left(1 - \frac{1}{p_2}\right) \cdots \left(1 - \frac{1}{p_m}\right).
\]

For \( n = 9999 = 3^2 \times 11 \times 101 \),

\[
\phi(9999) = 9999 \left(1 - \frac{1}{3}\right)\left(1 - \frac{1}{11}\right)\left(1 - \frac{1}{101}\right) = 9999 \cdot \frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{10}{11} \cdot \frac{100}{101} = 6000.
\]

Therefore, the number of distinct numerators obtained when numbers in \( S \) are written as fractions in lowest terms is 6000. The remainder when 6000 is divided by 1000 is

\[
\boxed{000}.
\]
