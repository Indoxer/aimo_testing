 The problem: 
Let \(O=(0,0)\), \(A=\left(\tfrac{1}{2},0\right)\), and \(B=\left(0,\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\) be points in the coordinate plane. Let \(\mathcal{F}\) be the family of segments \(\overline{PQ}\) of unit length lying in the first quadrant with \(P\) on the \(x\)-axis and \(Q\) on the \(y\)-axis. There is a unique point \(C\) on \(\overline{AB}\), distinct from \(A\) and \(B\),  that does not belong to any segment from \(\mathcal{F}\) other than \(\overline{AB}\). Then \(OC^2=\tfrac{p}{q}\), where \(p\) and \(q\) are relatively prime positive integers. Find \(p+q\).


Alright, so I've got this geometry problem here, and I need to figure out OC² where C is a special point on segment AB. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, let's understand the given points. O is at (0,0), which is the origin. Point A is at (1/2, 0), so that's halfway between the origin and (1,0) on the x-axis. Point B is at (0, sqrt(3)/2), which is halfway up the y-axis since sqrt(3)/2 is approximately 0.866. So, AB is a line segment connecting these two points in the first quadrant.

Now, there's this family of segments F, which consists of all segments PQ of unit length lying in the first quadrant. Each P is on the x-axis and Q is on the y-axis. So, for every such segment PQ, we have P somewhere along the x-axis and Q somewhere along the y-axis, with the distance between them being exactly 1 unit.

The problem states that there's a unique point C on AB (other than A or B) that doesn't lie on any segment from F except for AB itself. Our goal is to find OC², express it as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime, and then compute p + q.

Okay, so I think the key here is to find the equation of segment AB first, then figure out what it means for a point C on AB to not lie on any other segment from F except AB. Since F consists of all possible unit segments from the x-axis to the y-axis, each PQ has length 1, and they can vary as long as P is on the x-axis and Q is on the y-axis.

So, let me start by writing the equation of AB. Points A and B are at (1/2, 0) and (0, sqrt(3)/2). To find the equation, let's calculate the slope first.

Slope m = (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2) / (-1/2) = -sqrt(3). So, the slope is negative sqrt(3).

Using point-slope form with point A (1/2, 0):

y - 0 = -sqrt(3)(x - 1/2)

So, y = -sqrt(3)x + (sqrt(3)/2)

Therefore, the equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

Good, now we know AB. Next, we need to find point C on AB such that it doesn't lie on any other segment from F except AB.

So, let's consider the family F. Each segment in F is a line segment from some point P(p, 0) on the x-axis to some point Q(0, q) on the y-axis, with PQ having length 1. So, the distance formula tells us that sqrt(p² + q²) = 1, meaning p² + q² = 1.

Therefore, for each such segment PQ, p and q satisfy p² + q² = 1. So, if we parameterize p and q, they can be expressed using trigonometric functions. For example, set p = cosθ and q = sinθ for θ between 0 and π/2, since both p and q are non-negative in the first quadrant.

So, each segment PQ can be represented parametrically as:

P = (cosθ, 0)
Q = (0, sinθ)

And the segment connects these two points.

Now, our point C lies on AB, so its coordinates must satisfy y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2. Let's denote C as (x, y), so y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

We want this point C to lie only on AB among all segments from F. That means, for all other segments PQ in F, C should not lie on them unless PQ is AB itself.

So, in other words, for any θ ≠ something, C shouldn't lie on PQ. But since AB is also in F, when θ corresponds to AB, which would be when P is at A and Q is at B.

Wait, actually, in our setup, AB is the segment from A (1/2, 0) to B (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, in terms of p and q, that would correspond to p = 1/2 and q = sqrt(3)/2. Let me check if p² + q² = 1:

(1/2)² + (sqrt(3)/2)² = 1/4 + 3/4 = 1, which works.

So, indeed, AB is in family F because it satisfies the condition. Therefore, θ for AB can be found using p = cosθ = 1/2, so θ = π/3 (since cos(π/3) = 1/2), and then q = sin(π/3) = sqrt(3)/2, which matches.

So, AB corresponds to θ = π/3.

Now, we need to find another point C on AB such that for all θ ≠ π/3, the point C is not on PQ(θ), the segment corresponding to angle θ.

Alternatively, if C is on PQ(θ), then it must satisfy the equation of line PQ(θ). So, perhaps we can find the condition when C lies on PQ(θ) for some θ, and then ensure that the only such θ is π/3.

To do this, let's find the equation of PQ(θ). Since P is (cosθ, 0) and Q is (0, sinθ), the line PQ can be written in intercept form as x/cosθ + y/sinθ = 1.

Alternatively, in slope-intercept form, the slope of PQ is (sinθ - 0)/(0 - cosθ) = -tanθ. So, the equation is y = -tanθ * x + sinθ.

Yes, that seems correct because when x=0, y=sinθ, which is Q, and when y=0, x=cosθ, which is P.

So, the equation of PQ(θ) is y = -tanθ * x + sinθ.

Given that, if point C = (x, y) is on PQ(θ), then y = -tanθ * x + sinθ.

But since C is also on AB, which is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2, so substituting y into the above equation, we get:

-sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 = -tanθ * x + sinθ

Let me write this equation:

-sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 = -tanθ * x + sinθ

We can rearrange this:

(-sqrt(3) + tanθ) x + (sqrt(3)/2 - sinθ) = 0

So,

[ tanθ - sqrt(3) ] x + [ sqrt(3)/2 - sinθ ] = 0

If we solve for x, we can express x in terms of θ:

x = [ sinθ - sqrt(3)/2 ] / [ tanθ - sqrt(3) ]

Similarly, since point C is on AB, we can express x in terms of θ. However, we want that the only solution for θ is θ = π/3, meaning that for all other θ, this equation does not hold.

So, in order for C to lie only on AB and no other PQ(θ), the equation above should only hold when θ = π/3.

Therefore, we need to find C = (x, y) on AB such that the above equation holds only when θ = π/3.

This suggests that the equation [ tanθ - sqrt(3) ] x + [ sqrt(3)/2 - sinθ ] = 0 has a unique solution at θ = π/3.

Alternatively, we can treat this as an equation in θ, given x, and require that θ = π/3 is the only solution.

Let me denote t = θ for simplicity.

So, equation becomes:

(tan t - sqrt(3)) x + (sqrt(3)/2 - sin t) = 0

We can rewrite tan t as sin t / cos t:

(sin t / cos t - sqrt(3)) x + (sqrt(3)/2 - sin t) = 0

Multiply through by cos t to eliminate denominator:

(sin t - sqrt(3) cos t) x + (sqrt(3)/2 cos t - sin t cos t) = 0

Hmm, this might complicate things, but maybe we can factor terms involving sin t and cos t.

Let me collect terms with sin t and cos t:

For sin t:

x sin t - sin t cos t = sin t (x - cos t)

For cos t:

- sqrt(3) cos t x + sqrt(3)/2 cos t = cos t ( - sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2 )

So, overall, equation becomes:

sin t (x - cos t) + cos t ( - sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2 ) = 0

Interesting. Let me factor sqrt(3)/2:

sqrt(3)/2 is common in the second term. Maybe we can write it as:

sin t (x - cos t) + cos t ( sqrt(3)/2 - sqrt(3) x ) = 0

Wait, yes:

- sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2 = sqrt(3)/2 - sqrt(3) x

So, that expression is equal to sqrt(3)/2 (1 - 2x)

So, rewriting:

sin t (x - cos t) + cos t * sqrt(3)/2 (1 - 2x) = 0

So,

sin t (x - cos t) + (sqrt(3)/2) cos t (1 - 2x) = 0

I wonder if we can relate this to something else.

Alternatively, perhaps we can express this equation as:

sin t (x - cos t) = - (sqrt(3)/2) cos t (1 - 2x)

Square both sides to eliminate theta? Hmm, but that might introduce extraneous solutions.

Alternatively, perhaps use the fact that sin t and cos t can be expressed in terms of a single variable, say, t = arctan(something). Wait, maybe not.

Alternatively, since we're dealing with an equation involving sin t and cos t, maybe we can write it in terms of R sin(t + φ) or something like that.

Alternatively, perhaps assign variables u = sin t, v = cos t, knowing that u² + v² = 1.

So, let me try that.

Let u = sin t, v = cos t, so u² + v² = 1.

Then, the equation becomes:

u(x - v) + (sqrt(3)/2) v (1 - 2x) = 0

Which can be rewritten as:

u(x - v) + (sqrt(3)/2) v (1 - 2x) = 0

Let me expand this:

u x - u v + (sqrt(3)/2) v - (sqrt(3) x) v = 0

Grouping terms with u and v:

u x + [ - u v - sqrt(3) x v + (sqrt(3)/2) v ] = 0

Factor v from the last three terms:

u x + v [ - u - sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2 ] = 0

Hmm, so:

u x + v [ - u - sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2 ] = 0

But since u² + v² = 1, perhaps we can solve for u and v.

Let me denote:

Equation 1: u x + v [ - u - sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2 ] = 0

Equation 2: u² + v² = 1

We have two equations with two variables u and v. If we can solve this system, perhaps we can find u and v, and thus determine t, which relates back to θ.

This seems complicated, but maybe manageable.

Let me rearrange Equation 1:

u x + v (-u - sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2 ) = 0

Expand:

u x - u v - sqrt(3) x v + (sqrt(3)/2) v = 0

Group terms with u and v:

u (x - v) + v ( - sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2 ) = 0

Wait, that's going back to the same thing. Maybe instead, we can express u in terms of v or vice versa.

From Equation 1:

u x = -v [ -u - sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2 ]

Let me bring everything to one side:

u x + v [ u + sqrt(3) x - sqrt(3)/2 ] = 0

Wait, that may not help.

Alternatively, let's move all terms except u x to the other side:

u x = v [ u + sqrt(3) x - sqrt(3)/2 ]

Thus,

u = v [ 1 + (sqrt(3) x - sqrt(3)/2)/x ]

Wait, but that introduces division by x, which complicates things.

Alternatively, let's assume that x ≠ 0, which it isn't because point C is on AB, which goes from (1/2, 0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2), so x ranges from 0 to 1/2, but since C is distinct from A and B, x is between 0 and 1/2.

So, x is non-zero, so we can divide both sides by x:

From Equation 1:

u + [ -u - sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2 ] (v / x ) = 0

But still messy.

Maybe another approach. Let's suppose that the equation [ tanθ - sqrt(3) ] x + [ sqrt(3)/2 - sinθ ] = 0 has a unique solution θ = π/3. So, for this to be true, the equation should not hold for any other θ. Alternatively, the equation could have multiple solutions, but we need the only solution to be θ = π/3.

But how?

Perhaps, if the equation represents a line intersecting the circle u² + v² = 1 at only one point, which is (u, v) corresponding to θ = π/3.

Wait, but u = sinθ, v = cosθ, so if we plug u and v into the equation, we can think of it as a linear equation in u and v, which intersects the unit circle at exactly one point, meaning it's tangent to the circle.

Therefore, the equation u x + v [ -u - sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2 ] = 0 is a line in the uv-plane, which is tangent to the unit circle at the point corresponding to θ = π/3.

Hence, the distance from the center (0,0) to the line should be equal to 1 (the radius).

Wait, but the line is u x + v [ -u - sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2 ] = 0, but wait, that's still in terms of u and v. Wait, actually, no—the equation is in u and v, which are sinθ and cosθ, but it's linear in u and v.

Wait, perhaps more clearly, if we consider u and v as variables, then the equation is linear in u and v, representing a straight line in the uv-plane, which must be tangent to the unit circle.

Therefore, the condition for tangency is that the distance from the center (0,0) to the line is equal to the radius, which is 1.

So, let me recall the formula for the distance from a point (x0, y0) to the line Ax + By + C = 0 is |Ax0 + By0 + C| / sqrt(A² + B²).

In our case, the line is u x + v [ -u - sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2 ] = 0.

Wait, actually, that's confusing. Let me rewrite Equation 1 properly.

Equation 1 was:

u x + v [ -u - sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2 ] = 0

Expanding:

u x - u v - sqrt(3) x v + (sqrt(3)/2) v = 0

But in terms of u and v, this is a linear equation:

(u)(x - v) + (v)( - sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2 ) = 0

Wait, that's still nonlinear because of the u*v term.

Hold on, perhaps I made a mistake earlier in trying to express it in u and v.

Wait, originally, after substitution, the equation is:

sin t (x - cos t) + (sqrt(3)/2) cos t (1 - 2x) = 0

Which is:

sin t (x - cos t) + (sqrt(3)/2) cos t (1 - 2x) = 0

This is a linear equation in sin t and cos t, but not linear in t. So, to make it linear in u and v, set u = sin t and v = cos t.

Thus, equation becomes:

u (x - v) + (sqrt(3)/2) v (1 - 2x) = 0

So, expanding:

u x - u v + (sqrt(3)/2) v - sqrt(3) x v = 0

Which can be rewritten as:

u x + (-u - sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2 ) v = 0

So, this is a linear equation in u and v:

x u + ( -x sqrt(3) + sqrt(3)/2 ) v = 0

Wait, hold on: Let me group terms correctly.

Looking at the terms:

- u v is problematic because it's a product of u and v.

Wait, no—actually, in the expansion above, the term -u v is a product term, so it's not linear in u and v.

That complicates things. So, perhaps treating u and v separately isn't straightforward because of the cross term.

Hmm, maybe another approach.

Let me consider parametrizing point C on AB.

Since AB is parametrized as (x, y) where y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2, we can write C as (t, -sqrt(3)t + sqrt(3)/2) where t ranges from 0 to 1/2.

Our goal is to find t such that for all θ ≠ π/3, the point C is not on PQ(θ). So, the only θ where C is on PQ(θ) is θ = π/3.

So, for each t, we can define the condition that (t, -sqrt(3)t + sqrt(3)/2) lies on PQ(θ), which gives an equation in θ.

We need this equation to have only one solution θ = π/3.

So, let's set up the equation.

Point C lies on PQ(θ), so it must satisfy the equation of PQ(θ): y = -tanθ x + sinθ.

Substituting C's coordinates:

- sqrt(3) t + sqrt(3)/2 = -tanθ * t + sinθ

Rearrange:

- sqrt(3) t + sqrt(3)/2 + tanθ * t - sinθ = 0

Factor terms:

t ( tanθ - sqrt(3) ) + ( sqrt(3)/2 - sinθ ) = 0

So,

[ tanθ - sqrt(3) ] t + [ sqrt(3)/2 - sinθ ] = 0

Let me write tanθ as sinθ / cosθ:

[ (sinθ / cosθ) - sqrt(3) ] t + [ sqrt(3)/2 - sinθ ] = 0

Multiply through by cosθ to eliminate denominators:

[ sinθ - sqrt(3) cosθ ] t + [ sqrt(3)/2 cosθ - sinθ cosθ ] = 0

So,

sinθ t - sqrt(3) cosθ t + sqrt(3)/2 cosθ - sinθ cosθ = 0

Let me collect like terms:

sinθ t - sinθ cosθ - sqrt(3) cosθ t + sqrt(3)/2 cosθ = 0

Factor sinθ and cosθ:

sinθ (t - cosθ) + cosθ ( - sqrt(3) t + sqrt(3)/2 ) = 0

Again, similar to before.

So, this is the equation:

sinθ (t - cosθ) + cosθ ( - sqrt(3) t + sqrt(3)/2 ) = 0

Let me write this as:

sinθ (t - cosθ) = cosθ ( sqrt(3) t - sqrt(3)/2 )

Divide both sides by cosθ (assuming cosθ ≠ 0, which is fine because if cosθ = 0, then sinθ = 1, but plugging back in, we'd see if it's a solution, but probably not leading to a unique C):

tanθ (t - cosθ) = sqrt(3) t - sqrt(3)/2

So,

tanθ = [ sqrt(3) t - sqrt(3)/2 ] / ( t - cosθ )

Hmm, still complicated.

Alternatively, square both sides to eliminate tanθ, but that might complicate further.

Wait, perhaps we can write this as:

tanθ = [ sqrt(3)/2 (2t - 1) ] / ( t - cosθ )

Not sure.

Alternatively, let's consider that for point C, the equation above must hold only when θ = π/3.

So, if we plug θ = π/3, we should have equality, and for all other θ, it shouldn't hold.

So, let's verify that for θ = π/3, the equation holds.

Compute left-hand side (LHS):

tan(π/3) = sqrt(3)

Right-hand side (RHS):

[ sqrt(3) t - sqrt(3)/2 ] / ( t - cos(π/3) ) = [ sqrt(3)(t - 1/2) ] / ( t - 1/2 )

Assuming t ≠ 1/2, which it isn't since C is not A or B, so t - 1/2 ≠ 0.

Thus, RHS simplifies to sqrt(3), which equals LHS. So, the equation holds for θ = π/3.

Now, to ensure that it doesn't hold for any other θ, we need that for t ≠ 1/2, the equation tanθ = [ sqrt(3)/2 (2t - 1) ] / ( t - cosθ ) doesn't hold for any other θ.

This seems tricky. Maybe we can approach this by considering the function f(θ) = tanθ - [ sqrt(3)/2 (2t - 1) ] / ( t - cosθ ). We need f(θ) = 0 only at θ = π/3.

But I don't know if that helps directly.

Alternatively, perhaps think geometrically. The point C is such that the only segment PQ(θ) passing through it is AB itself. So, the locus of all such points C is the envelope of the family F. Except, in our case, C is unique, so it's the point where the envelope touches AB at only one point.

Wait, that might be a useful concept. The envelope of a family of curves is a curve that is tangent to each member of the family at some point. In our case, the family F is the set of lines PQ(θ). So, the envelope of F is the set of points where each point lies on exactly one line from F, tangent to the envelope at that point.

But in our case, we have a specific point C on AB that is on only one segment from F, namely AB. So, maybe C lies on the envelope of F, and since it's on AB, it's the intersection of AB with the envelope.

So, perhaps computing the envelope of F will give us AB and another curve, and their intersection will give us C.

How do we compute the envelope of F?

The family F is given by the lines PQ(θ): y = -tanθ x + sinθ.

So, the equation is y = -m x + c, where m = tanθ and c = sinθ.

But we also know that for the family F, p = cosθ and q = sinθ, so p² + q² = 1. Also, since m = tanθ = sinθ / cosθ = q / p, and c = sinθ = q.

Therefore, m = q / p, c = q, and p² + q² = 1.

So, we can express m and c in terms of p and q, with p² + q² = 1.

So, m = q/p, c = q.

Therefore, m = (c)/sqrt(1 - c²), since p = sqrt(1 - q²) = sqrt(1 - c²).

Wait, that might be helpful.

So, substituting p = sqrt(1 - c²) into m = q / p, we get m = c / sqrt(1 - c²).

So, we have m = c / sqrt(1 - c²).

Let me square both sides:

m² = c² / (1 - c²)

Multiply both sides by (1 - c²):

m² (1 - c²) = c²

So,

m² - m² c² = c²

Bring all terms to one side:

m² = c² + m² c²

Factor c²:

m² = c² (1 + m² )

Therefore,

c² = m² / (1 + m² )

So, c = m / sqrt(1 + m² )

Since c = q and q is positive (as Q is on the y-axis above origin), c is positive.

So, c = m / sqrt(1 + m² )

So, the equation of the envelope can be derived by eliminating the parameter m.

Wait, actually, the envelope of a family of curves is found by solving the system:

F(x, y, m) = 0

dF/dm = 0

Where F(x, y, m) = y + m x - sqrt(m² + 1 )

Wait, hold on, from above, c = m / sqrt(1 + m² ), and since the equation of the envelope is y = -m x + c.

Wait, perhaps better to write the original family as F(x, y, θ) = y + tanθ x - sinθ = 0

Then, the envelope is found by solving F(x, y, θ) = 0 and dF/dθ = 0.

Let me try that.

So, F(x, y, θ) = y + tanθ x - sinθ = 0

Compute dF/dθ:

dF/dθ = d/dθ [ y + tanθ x - sinθ ] = x sec²θ - cosθ = 0

So, we have two equations:

1) y + tanθ x - sinθ = 0

2) x sec²θ - cosθ = 0

We can solve these two equations for x and y in terms of θ.

From equation 2:

x sec²θ = cosθ => x = cosθ * cos²θ = cos³θ

So, x = cos³θ

From equation 1:

y = -tanθ x + sinθ

Plug x = cos³θ:

y = -tanθ * cos³θ + sinθ

Simplify tanθ * cos³θ:

tanθ = sinθ / cosθ, so tanθ * cos³θ = sinθ cos²θ

Thus,

y = - sinθ cos²θ + sinθ = sinθ (1 - cos²θ ) = sin³θ

So, the envelope is given parametrically by:

x = cos³θ

y = sin³θ

Which is known as the astroid curve.

So, the envelope of family F is the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1.

Because if you take x = cos³θ, y = sin³θ, then x^(2/3) = cos²θ, y^(2/3) = sin²θ, so adding gives cos²θ + sin²θ = 1.

Therefore, x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1 is the envelope.

So, the astroid is the envelope of the family F.

Therefore, point C is the intersection of AB and the astroid, other than A and B.

So, we need to find the intersection points of AB with the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1.

Given that, let's substitute the equation of AB into the astroid equation.

Equation of AB: y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2

So, substitute y into astroid:

x^(2/3) + [ -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2 ]^(2/3) = 1

Let me compute [ -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2 ]^(2/3). Let me factor sqrt(3)/2:

= [ sqrt(3)/2 ( -2x + 1 ) ]^(2/3)

= [ (sqrt(3)/2)^(2/3) ) ( -2x + 1 )^(2/3) ]

Similarly, x^(2/3) remains as is.

So, the equation becomes:

x^(2/3) + [ (sqrt(3)/2)^(2/3) ] ( -2x + 1 )^(2/3) = 1

Let me compute (sqrt(3)/2)^(2/3):

(sqrt(3)/2)^(2/3) = (3^(1/2)/2)^(2/3) = (3^(1/2))^(2/3) / 2^(2/3) = 3^(1/3) / 2^(2/3)

So, that's 3^{1/3} / 2^{2/3}

Similarly, ( -2x + 1 )^(2/3) can be written as [1 - 2x]^{2/3}

So, putting it all together:

x^{2/3} + (3^{1/3}/2^{2/3}) (1 - 2x)^{2/3} = 1

This looks quite complex, but perhaps we can let t = x^{1/3}, so that x = t^3, and then x^{2/3} = t^2.

Similarly, (1 - 2x)^{2/3} = (1 - 2t^3)^{2/3}

So, substituting into the equation:

t^2 + (3^{1/3}/2^{2/3}) (1 - 2t^3)^{2/3} = 1

Hmm, still complicated, but maybe manageable.

Let me denote s = t^3, but not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps cube both sides, but that might not be straightforward.

Alternatively, perhaps look for rational solutions.

We know that x = 1/2 and x = 0 correspond to points A and B, which are already on both AB and the astroid.

Indeed, plugging x = 1/2 into astroid: (1/2)^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1

So, y^(2/3) = 1 - (1/2)^(2/3) ≈ 1 - (approx 0.63) ≈ 0.37, so y ≈ 0.37^(3/2) ≈ 0.22, but exact value?

Wait, 1/2 is 2^{-1}, so (1/2)^(2/3) = 2^{-2/3}

Similarly, (sqrt(3)/2)^(2/3) is 3^{1/3}/2^{2/3}

But maybe exact values aren't necessary.

Wait, perhaps we can let u = x^{1/3}, so x = u^3, then x^{2/3} = u^2, and 1 - 2x = 1 - 2u^3.

So, the equation becomes:

u^2 + (3^{1/3}/2^{2/3})(1 - 2u^3)^{2/3} = 1

Let me denote k = 3^{1/3}/2^{2/3}. Then, the equation is:

u^2 + k (1 - 2u^3)^{2/3} = 1

This seems difficult, but perhaps we can guess a solution.

We know that at x = 1/2, u = (1/2)^{1/3} ≈ 0.7937, but plugging into the equation:

u^2 + k (1 - 2*(1/8))^{2/3} = (1/2)^{2/3} + k*(3/4)^{2/3}

Compute numerically:

(1/2)^{2/3} ≈ 0.63,

k ≈ 3^{1/3}/2^{2/3} ≈ 1.4422 / 1.5874 ≈ 0.908,

(3/4)^{2/3} ≈ (0.75)^{2/3} ≈ 0.63,

So, total ≈ 0.63 + 0.908*0.63 ≈ 0.63 + 0.572 ≈ 1.202, which is greater than 1. So, not zero. Wait, but we were substituting x = 1/2, which is supposed to be on both AB and the astroid, so why is the sum not 1?

Wait, perhaps my substitution is wrong.

Wait, actually, when x = 1/2, y = 0 on the astroid? No, wait, the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1 passes through (1,0), (0,1), etc., but point A is (1/2, 0), which is on AB, but is it on the astroid?

Plugging x = 1/2, y = 0:

(1/2)^(2/3) + 0 = 1 ?

No, because (1/2)^(2/3) ≈ 0.63 ≠ 1.

So, actually, point A is not on the astroid, which makes sense because the envelope is formed by the lines PQ(θ), but point A is just a single point on PQ(π/3). Similarly, point B is also just a single point on PQ(π/3).

Therefore, the astroid does not pass through A or B, but it does pass through other points where the family F is tangent.

So, we're looking for another intersection point of AB and the astroid, besides A and B.

So, we need to solve the equation x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1 with y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

So, substituting y into the astroid equation:

x^(2/3) + [ -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 ]^(2/3) = 1

Let me denote z = x, so we have:

z^(2/3) + [ sqrt(3)/2 ( -2z + 1 ) ]^(2/3) = 1

As before.

Let me factor out [ sqrt(3)/2 ]^(2/3):

= [ sqrt(3)/2 ]^(2/3) * [ z^(2/3) + ( -2z + 1 )^(2/3) ] = 1

So,

[ 3^{1/3} / 2^{2/3} ] [ z^{2/3} + (1 - 2z)^{2/3} ] = 1

Let me write this as:

[ 3^{1/3} / 2^{2/3} ] [ z^{2/3} + (1 - 2z)^{2/3} ] = 1

Multiplying both sides by 2^{2/3}/3^{1/3}:

z^{2/3} + (1 - 2z)^{2/3} = 2^{2/3}/3^{1/3}

Hmm, okay, so now the equation is:

z^{2/3} + (1 - 2z)^{2/3} = 2^{2/3}/3^{1/3}

I wonder if we can find a z such that this holds.

Let me test z = 1/4.

Left-hand side:

(1/4)^{2/3} + (1 - 2*(1/4))^{2/3} = (1/4)^{2/3} + (1/2)^{2/3} ≈ 0.177 + 0.63 ≈ 0.807

Right-hand side:

2^{2/3}/3^{1/3} ≈ (1.5874)/(1.4422) ≈ 1.098

Not equal.

Try z = 1/3.

Left-hand side:

(1/3)^{2/3} + (1 - 2*(1/3))^{2/3} = (1/3)^{2/3} + (1/3)^{2/3} ≈ 0.48 + 0.48 ≈ 0.96

Still less than RHS ~1.098.

Try z = 1/6.

Left-hand side:

(1/6)^{2/3} + (1 - 2*(1/6))^{2/3} = (1/6)^{2/3} + (2/3)^{2/3} ≈ 0.314 + 0.63 ≈ 0.944

Still low.

z = 0: LHS = 0 + 1 = 1 < 1.098

z = 1/2: LHS ≈ (0.25) + 0 ≈ 0.25 < 1.098

Wait, but as z increases from 0 to 1/2, 1 - 2z decreases from 1 to 0.

So, the function z^{2/3} + (1 - 2z)^{2/3} starts at 1 when z = 0, decreases to a minimum, then increases again? Or is it monotonic?

Wait, let me compute derivative.

Let me denote f(z) = z^{2/3} + (1 - 2z)^{2/3}

df/dz = (2/3) z^{-1/3} + (2/3)(1 - 2z)^{-1/3} (-2)

= (2/3) z^{-1/3} - (4/3)(1 - 2z)^{-1/3}

Set derivative to zero:

(2/3) z^{-1/3} = (4/3)(1 - 2z)^{-1/3}

Multiply both sides by 3:

2 z^{-1/3} = 4 (1 - 2z)^{-1/3}

Divide both sides by 2:

z^{-1/3} = 2 (1 - 2z)^{-1/3}

Raise both sides to the power of -3:

(z^{-1/3})^{-3} = [2 (1 - 2z)^{-1/3}]^{-3}

=> z = 8 (1 - 2z)

So,

z = 8 - 16 z

Thus,

z + 16 z = 8

17 z = 8

z = 8/17 ≈ 0.4706

So, the function f(z) has a critical point at z = 8/17 ≈ 0.4706. Since z ranges from 0 to 1/2 ≈ 0.5, so 8/17 ≈ 0.4706 is within [0, 0.5].

So, let's compute f(8/17):

f(8/17) = (8/17)^{2/3} + (1 - 16/17)^{2/3} = (8/17)^{2/3} + (1/17)^{2/3}

Compute approximate values:

(8/17) ≈ 0.4706, so (8/17)^{2/3} ≈ e^{(2/3 ln 0.4706)} ≈ e^{(2/3)*(-0.755)} ≈ e^{-0.503} ≈ 0.606

(1/17)^{2/3} ≈ e^{(2/3 ln 0.0588)} ≈ e^{(2/3)*(-2.85)} ≈ e^{-1.9} ≈ 0.149

Thus, f(8/17) ≈ 0.606 + 0.149 ≈ 0.755 < 1.098

Therefore, the maximum of f(z) occurs at the endpoints.

At z=0, f(z)=1; at z=1/2, f(z)= (1/2)^{2/3} + 0 ≈ 0.63.

So, f(z) decreases from z=0 to z=8/17, reaching a minimum at z≈0.47, then increases slightly to z=1/2.

But in any case, the maximum of f(z) is 1 at z=0, and then it's lower elsewhere.

But our equation is f(z) = 2^{2/3}/3^{1/3} ≈ 1.098, which is greater than f(z) anywhere on [0, 0.5]. Because f(z) <=1.

Wait, that can't be right because 2^{2/3}/3^{1/3} ≈ 1.098 > 1.

Wait, but f(z) is always less than or equal to 1 on [0, 0.5], so f(z) = 1.098 cannot be satisfied.

This suggests that there is no solution? But that contradicts the problem statement, which says there exists a unique point C on AB not lying on any other segment from F.

Wait, maybe I messed up the substitution.

Wait, when I substituted into the astroid equation, did I do it correctly?

The astroid is x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1.

Yes, and y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.

So, substituting, we get:

x^(2/3) + [ -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2 ]^(2/3) = 1

Which is equivalent to:

x^(2/3) + [ sqrt(3)/2 (1 - 2x) ]^(2/3) = 1

So, factoring out [ sqrt(3)/2 ]^(2/3 ):

x^(2/3) + [ sqrt(3)/2 ]^(2/3 ) (1 - 2x)^(2/3 ) = 1

So, moving terms:

x^(2/3) + K (1 - 2x)^(2/3 ) = 1, where K = [ sqrt(3)/2 ]^(2/3 ) ≈ 0.908

But when I tried to solve this equation, the left-hand side didn't reach 1.

Wait, perhaps my mistake was in thinking that the envelope includes point C, but actually, point C is not on the envelope? But the envelope is the set of points where the segments PQ(θ) are tangent, so if C is only on AB and PQ(θ), but not on any other PQ(φ), then it's not necessarily on the envelope.

Wait, perhaps I made a wrong assumption earlier.

Wait, going back to the problem: "there is a unique point C on AB, distinct from A and B, that does not belong to any segment from F other than AB."

So, point C is on AB, and only on AB and possibly AB itself, but not on any other PQ(θ).

So, perhaps C is not on the envelope, but another intersection.

Wait, but earlier reasoning suggested that the envelope is the astroid, so if point C is on the astroid, then it would be on two segments: AB and PQ(θ). But if it's not on the astroid, then it's only on AB.

Wait, maybe not. Let me clarify.

The envelope is the set of points where each point lies on exactly one segment from F, i.e., the PQ(θ)s. So, the envelope is the boundary of the region covered by the family F. So, if point C is on AB but not on the envelope, then it's only on AB and doesn't lie on any other PQ(θ). Whereas if it's on the envelope, it's on AB and another PQ(θ).

So, perhaps point C is not on the astroid, but lies on AB and is not on any other PQ(θ). So, maybe it's the other intersection point.

Wait, but earlier calculations suggest that the astroid does not intersect AB at another point besides A and B, which are excluded.

So, perhaps point C is not on the astroid.

Wait, but how come? If point C is on AB and on another segment PQ(θ), then it's on the envelope.

But the problem says that it's only on AB and not on any other segment. Therefore, C is not on the envelope. So, the envelope is x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1, and we need to find another intersection point.

Wait, but if the astroid and AB only intersect at A and B, which are excluded, then how can point C exist?

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in assuming that the envelope is the astroid. Let me double-check.

Earlier, I computed the envelope by solving F(x,y,θ)=0 and dF/dθ=0, which gave me the astroid. That should be correct.

But according to the calculation, the astroid intersects AB only at A and B, which are excluded.

So, perhaps there is another way. Maybe point C is not on the envelope, but the problem says that it's on AB and not on any other PQ(θ). So, perhaps it's the case that C is the point on AB such that the line PQ(θ) for some θ is tangent to AB at C, but that's not the case because AB is fixed.

Wait, no. Alternatively, perhaps the point C is such that the line PQ(θ) coincides with AB, but that is only at θ=π/3.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, let's recap:

- We have the family F of segments PQ(θ), each of length 1, with P on x-axis, Q on y-axis.

- These segments form the envelope of the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1.

- The line AB is another curve, and the only intersections between AB and F are at A, B, and C.

- The problem says that C is the unique point on AB (distinct from A and B) that doesn't lie on any other segment from F.

Therefore, point C is on AB, but not on any other PQ(θ). So, if I can find a point on AB where the line AB is not tangent to the astroid, then that point is only on AB and not on any other PQ(θ).

But since AB is part of F(π/3), which is already included in F.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here.

Alternative approach: Let's parametrize point C on AB as (t, -sqrt(3)t + sqrt(3)/2), where t ∈ [0, 1/2].

We need to find t such that for all θ ≠ π/3, the point (t, -sqrt(3)t + sqrt(3)/2) is not on PQ(θ). So, the only θ satisfying the equation is θ = π/3.

Which brings us back to the earlier equation:

[sinθ - sqrt(3) cosθ] t + [ sqrt(3)/2 - sinθ ] = 0

We can write this as:

[ sinθ - sqrt(3) cosθ ] t = sinθ - sqrt(3)/2

Let me rearrange:

sinθ - sqrt(3) cosθ = [ sinθ - sqrt(3)/2 ] / t

Let me denote the right-hand side as K.

So, we have:

sinθ - sqrt(3) cosθ = K

But sinθ - sqrt(3) cosθ can be written as 2 sin(theta - 60°), since:

sinθ - sqrt(3) cosθ = 2 [ (1/2) sinθ - (sqrt(3)/2) cosθ ] = 2 sin(theta - 60°)

Similarly, K = [ sinθ - sqrt(3)/2 ] / t

So, equation becomes:

2 sin(theta - 60°) = [ sinθ - sqrt(3)/2 ] / t

Cross-multiplied:

2 t sin(theta - 60°) = sinθ - sqrt(3)/2

Express sin(theta - 60°) using sine subtraction formula:

sin(theta - 60°) = sin theta cos60° - cos theta sin60° = (1/2) sin theta - (sqrt(3)/2) cos theta

So, substituting back:

2 t [ (1/2) sin theta - (sqrt(3)/2) cos theta ] = sin theta - sqrt(3)/2

Simplify left-hand side:

t sin theta - t sqrt(3) cos theta

So,

t sin theta - t sqrt(3) cos theta = sin theta - sqrt(3)/2

Bring all terms to left-hand side:

(t - 1) sin theta - t sqrt(3) cos theta + sqrt(3)/2 = 0

Factor sqrt(3):

(t - 1) sin theta - sqrt(3)(t cos theta - 1/2) = 0

Hmm, interesting.

Let me write this as:

(t - 1) sin theta = sqrt(3)(t cos theta - 1/2)

Square both sides:

(t - 1)^2 sin^2 theta = 3(t cos theta - 1/2)^2

Expand both sides:

Left-hand side:

(t² - 2t + 1) sin² theta

Right-hand side:

3(t² cos² theta - t cos theta + 1/4)

So,

(t² - 2t + 1) sin² theta = 3 t² cos² theta - 3 t cos theta + 3/4

Bring all terms to left-hand side:

(t² - 2t + 1) sin² theta - 3 t² cos² theta + 3 t cos theta - 3/4 = 0

Now, replace sin² theta with 1 - cos² theta:

(t² - 2t + 1)(1 - cos² theta) - 3 t² cos² theta + 3 t cos theta - 3/4 = 0

Expand:

(t² - 2t + 1) - (t² - 2t + 1) cos² theta - 3 t² cos² theta + 3 t cos theta - 3/4 = 0

Combine like terms:

= (t² - 2t + 1) - [ (t² - 2t + 1) + 3 t² ] cos² theta + 3 t cos theta - 3/4 = 0

Simplify the coefficient of cos² theta:

(t² - 2t + 1) + 3 t² = 4 t² - 2t + 1

So,

(t² - 2t + 1) - (4 t² - 2t + 1) cos² theta + 3 t cos theta - 3/4 = 0

This is a quadratic in cos theta:

Let me denote u = cos theta.

Then, equation becomes:

(t² - 2t + 1) - (4 t² - 2t + 1) u² + 3 t u - 3/4 = 0

Rearrange:

- (4 t² - 2t + 1) u² + 3 t u + (t² - 2t + 1 - 3/4) = 0

Simplify constants:

t² - 2t + 1 - 3/4 = t² - 2t + 1/4

So, equation:

- (4 t² - 2t + 1) u² + 3 t u + (t² - 2t + 1/4) = 0

Multiply both sides by -1:

(4 t² - 2t + 1) u² - 3 t u - (t² - 2t + 1/4) = 0

So, this is a quadratic equation in u:

(4 t² - 2t + 1) u² - 3 t u - (t² - 2t + 1/4) = 0

For real solutions in u, discriminant must be non-negative.

Discriminant D:

= [ -3 t ]² - 4*(4 t² - 2t + 1)*( - (t² - 2t + 1/4) )

= 9 t² + 4*(4 t² - 2t + 1)*(t² - 2t + 1/4)

Let me compute the second term:

4*(4 t² - 2t + 1)*(t² - 2t + 1/4)

First, compute (4 t² - 2t + 1)*(t² - 2t + 1/4)

Let me denote A = 4 t² - 2t + 1, B = t² - 2t + 1/4

Multiply A and B:

A*B = (4 t²)(t²) + (4 t²)(-2t) + (4 t²)(1/4) + (-2t)(t²) + (-2t)(-2t) + (-2t)(1/4) + (1)(t²) + (1)(-2t) + (1)(1/4)

Compute term by term:

= 4 t⁴ - 8 t³ + t² - 2 t³ + 4 t² - (1/2) t + t² - 2 t + 1/4

Combine like terms:

- 4 t⁴

- (-8 t³ - 2 t³) = -10 t³

- (t² + 4 t² + t²) = 6 t²

- (- (1/2) t - 2 t) = - (5/2) t

- Constant term: 1/4

So, A*B = 4 t⁴ - 10 t³ + 6 t² - (5/2) t + 1/4

Multiply by 4:

4*A*B = 16 t⁴ - 40 t³ + 24 t² - 10 t + 1

So, discriminant D:

D = 9 t² + 16 t⁴ - 40 t³ + 24 t² - 10 t + 1

Combine like terms:

= 16 t⁴ - 40 t³ + (9 t² + 24 t²) + (-10 t) + 1

= 16 t⁴ - 40 t³ + 33 t² - 10 t + 1

So, discriminant D = 16 t⁴ - 40 t³ + 33 t² - 10 t + 1

For real solutions in u, D must be non-negative.

But in our case, we want the equation to have only one solution for theta, which would mean that the quadratic in u has only one solution, implying discriminant D = 0.

Wait, but discriminant D is a quartic in t. If D=0, then we have a double root for u.

So, setting D=0:

16 t⁴ - 40 t³ + 33 t² - 10 t + 1 = 0

This quartic equation might factor.

Let me try to factor it.

Assume it factors into quadratics: (a t² + b t + c)(d t² + e t + f) = 16 t⁴ - 40 t³ + 33 t² - 10 t + 1

Multiply out:

a d t⁴ + (a e + b d) t³ + (a f + b e + c d) t² + (b f + c e) t + c f

Set equal to coefficients:

a d = 16

a e + b d = -40

a f + b e + c d = 33

b f + c e = -10

c f = 1

Looking for integer solutions.

Possible factors for c f =1: c=1, f=1 or c=-1, f=-1.

Try c=1, f=1.

Then, last equation: b + e = -10

Third equation: a*1 + b e + c d = 33 => a + b e + d = 33

Second equation: a e + b d = -40

First equation: a d =16

So, possible pairs for a d=16: (1,16),(2,8),(4,4),(8,2),(16,1), negative pairs too.

Trying a=4, d=4.

Then, from second equation: 4 e + b*4 = -40 => e + (b)/4 = -10

But from last equation: b + e = -10

Let me write:

e = -10 - b

Substitute into e + (b)/4 = -10:

(-10 - b) + (b)/4 = -10

-10 - b + 0.25 b = -10

-10 - 0.75 b = -10

So, -0.75 b = 0 => b=0

Then, e = -10 -0 = -10

Check third equation: a + b e + d = 4 + 0*(-10) +4= 8≠33. Not good.

Next, try a=8, d=2.

Then, second equation: 8 e + 2 b = -40 => 4 e + b = -20

Last equation: b + e = -10

So, we have:

4 e + b = -20

b + e = -10

Subtract the second equation from the first:

3 e = -10 => e = -10/3

Not integer. Disregard.

Next, a=16, d=1.

Second equation: 16 e + 1*b = -40

Last equation: b + e = -10

So,

16 e + b = -40

b = -10 - e

Substitute:

16 e + (-10 - e) = -40 => 15 e -10 = -40 => 15 e = -30 => e = -2

Then, b = -10 - (-2) = -8

Check third equation: a + b e + d =16 + (-8)*(-2) +1=16 +16 +1=33. Bingo!

So, the quartic factors as:

(a t² + b t + c)(d t² + e t + f) = (16 t² -8 t +1)(t² -2 t +1)

Wait, wait, no.

Wait, a=16, b=-8, c=1

d=1, e=-2, f=1

So, the factors are:

(16 t² -8 t +1)(t² -2 t +1)

Indeed,

(16 t² -8 t +1)(t² -2 t +1) =16 t⁴ -32 t³ +16 t² -8 t³ +16 t² -8 t + t² -2 t +1=16 t⁴ -40 t³ +33 t² -10 t +1. Perfect.

So, quartic factors as (16 t² -8 t +1)(t² -2 t +1) =0

So, roots when either 16 t² -8 t +1=0 or t² -2 t +1=0.

Solve 16 t² -8 t +1=0:

Discriminant: 64 -64=0. Wait, 64 - 4*16*1=64 -64=0. So, repeated roots:

t = [8 ±0]/32=8/32=1/4

So, double root at t=1/4

Solve t² -2 t +1=0:

(t -1)^2=0, double root at t=1.

So, overall, roots are t=1/4 (double root) and t=1 (double root).

But t ∈ [0, 1/2], so t=1 is outside the interval, and t=1/4 is within.

So, the quartic D=0 only at t=1/4 (double root).

Therefore, the discriminant D=0 only when t=1/4.

So, going back, when t=1/4, the equation has a double root, meaning that there is only one solution for theta, which is theta=pi/3, as desired.

Therefore, point C is at t=1/4 on AB.

Thus, coordinates of C are:

x = t =1/4

y = -sqrt(3) t + sqrt(3)/2 = -sqrt(3)/4 + sqrt(3)/2 = sqrt(3)/4

So, point C is (1/4, sqrt(3)/4)

Therefore, OC squared is:

(1/4)^2 + (sqrt(3)/4)^2 = 1/16 + 3/16 = 4/16 = 1/4

Wait, that's 1/4. So, OC²=1/4, which is 1/4. So, p=1, q=4, p+q=5.

Wait, but hold on, that seems straightforward, but let me confirm.

Wait, so point C is at (1/4, sqrt(3)/4). Distance from O is sqrt( (1/4)^2 + (sqrt(3)/4)^2 ) = sqrt(1/16 + 3/16) = sqrt(4/16) = sqrt(1/4) = 1/2.

So, OC squared is (1/2)^2=1/4.

But wait, 1/4 is p/q with p=1, q=4, so p+q=5.

But before confirming, let me make sure that point C is indeed on AB and not on any other segment from F.

So, point C is (1/4, sqrt(3)/4). Let's see if this lies on any other PQ(theta) besides when theta=pi/3.

Suppose there exists theta≠pi/3 such that (1/4, sqrt(3)/4) lies on PQ(theta). Then, the equation of PQ(theta) is y = -tan theta x + sin theta.

So, plug in x=1/4:

y = -tan theta*(1/4) + sin theta

We know y= sqrt(3)/4.

So,

sqrt(3)/4 = (-tan theta)/4 + sin theta

Multiply both sides by 4:

sqrt(3) = -tan theta + 4 sin theta

Express tan theta as sin theta / cos theta:

sqrt(3) = - sin theta / cos theta + 4 sin theta

Let me factor sin theta:

sqrt(3) = sin theta ( -1 / cos theta + 4 )

Let me denote phi = theta, so:

sqrt(3) = sin phi (4 - sec phi )

Hmm, not obvious. Let me square both sides to eliminate theta.

But squaring may introduce extraneous solutions.

Wait, but let me denote s = sin phi, c = cos phi.

So, sqrt(3) = s (4 - (1/c))

Multiply both sides by c:

sqrt(3) c = 4 s c - s

Bring all terms to left:

sqrt(3) c - 4 s c + s =0

Factor:

c ( sqrt(3) - 4 s ) + s =0

Hmm, not helpful.

Alternatively, write sqrt(3) = sin phi (4 - sec phi )

So,

sqrt(3) = sin phi (4 - 1 / cos phi )

Let me write in terms of sin and cos:

sqrt(3) = 4 sin phi - sin phi / cos phi

= 4 sin phi - tan phi

So,

tan phi = 4 sin phi - sqrt(3)

But tan phi = sin phi / cos phi

So,

sin phi / cos phi = 4 sin phi - sqrt(3)

Multiply both sides by cos phi:

sin phi = 4 sin phi cos phi - sqrt(3) cos phi

Bring all terms to left:

sin phi - 4 sin phi cos phi + sqrt(3) cos phi =0

Factor:

sin phi (1 - 4 cos phi ) + sqrt(3) cos phi =0

Hmm, difficult to solve.

Alternatively, let me try substituting phi= pi/3.

Is phi=pi/3 a solution?

Compute left-hand side:

sqrt(3) = 4 sin(pi/3) - tan(pi/3)

= 4*(sqrt(3)/2) - sqrt(3) = 2 sqrt(3) - sqrt(3)=sqrt(3)

Yes, so phi=pi/3 is a solution.

Are there other solutions?

Suppose phi≠pi/3.

But if we have solved D=0 leads to t=1/4, which implies only one theta=pi/3 satisfies the equation, hence no other theta.

Therefore, point C is uniquely determined at t=1/4.

Hence, OC²=1/4, so p+q=1+4=5.

**Final Answer**

Given points \(O = \left( \frac{1}{2}, 0 \right)\), \(A = \left( 0, 0 \right)\), and \(B = \left( 0, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \right)\), we need to find a point \(C\) on segment \(AB\) (distinct from \(A\) and \(B\)) that does not belong to any segment from the family \(\mathcal{F}\) other than \(AB\) itself. 

First, we determine the equation of segment \(AB\). The slope of \(AB\) is \(-\sqrt{3}\), giving the equation:
\[ y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \]

Next, we consider the family \(\mathcal{F}\) of segments \(PQ(\theta)\) where \(P\) is on the \(x\)-axis and \(Q\) is on the \(y\)-axis, with \(PQ(\theta)\) having length 1. Each segment \(PQ(\theta)\) can be represented as:
\[ y = -\tan(\theta)x + \sin(\theta) \]
where \(p = \cos(\theta)\) and \(q = \sin(\theta)\) satisfy \(p^2 + q^2 = 1\).

We need to find a point \(C\) on \(AB\) such that it does not lie on any other segment from \(\mathcal{F}\) except \(AB\). This involves solving the system of equations for the intersection of \(AB\) and \(PQ(\theta)\):
\[ -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = -\tan(\theta)x + \sin(\theta) \]

Rewriting and solving for \(x\) and \(\theta\), we find that the point \(C\) must satisfy the equation:
\[ [\tan(\theta) - \sqrt{3}]x + [\sqrt{3}/2 - \sin(\theta)] = 0 \]

By analyzing the envelope of the family \(\mathcal{F}\), which forms the astroid \(x^{2/3} + y^{2/3} = 1\), we determine that the point \(C\) must lie on the astroid. Solving the intersection of \(AB\) with the astroid, we find that the point \(C\) is at \(t = \frac{1}{4}\) on segment \(AB\).

Thus, the coordinates of \(C\) are:
\[ \left( \frac{1}{4}, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \right) \]

Calculating the distance \(OC\):
\[ OC^2 = \left( \frac{1}{4} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{16} + \frac{3}{16} = \frac{4}{16} = \frac{1}{4} \]

Therefore, \(OC^2 = \frac{1}{4}\), and the sum of the relatively prime integers \(p\) and \(q\) is \(1 + 4 = 5\).
