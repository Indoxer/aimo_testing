 The problem: 
Find the three-digit positive integer $\underline{a}\,\underline{b}\,\underline{c}$ whose representation in base nine is $\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\,\underline{a}_{\,\text{nine}},$ where $a,$ $b,$ and $c$ are (not necessarily distinct) digits.


To find the three-digit positive integer \(\underline{a}\,\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\) whose representation in base nine is \(\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\,\underline{a}_{\,\text{nine}}\), we need to express both numbers in base ten and set them equal to each other.

First, let's express the number \(\underline{a}\,\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\) in base ten:
\[
\underline{a}\,\underline{b}\,\underline{c} = 100a + 10b + c
\]

Next, let's express the number \(\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\,\underline{a}_{\,\text{nine}}\) in base ten. Since \(\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\,\underline{a}_{\,\text{nine}}\) is a base nine number, we convert it as follows:
\[
\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\,\underline{a}_{\,\text{nine}} = b \cdot 9^2 + c \cdot 9^1 + a \cdot 9^0 = 81b + 9c + a
\]

We are given that these two expressions are equal:
\[
100a + 10b + c = 81b + 9c + a
\]

To solve for \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\), we first simplify the equation by moving all terms involving \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) to one side:
\[
100a + 10b + c - 81b - 9c - a = 0
\]
\[
99a - 71b - 8c = 0
\]

Rearrange the equation to isolate \(a\):
\[
99a = 71b + 8c
\]

Since \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are digits (0-9), we need to find values that satisfy this equation. We will test possible values for \(a\) and see if we can find corresponding values for \(b\) and \(c\).

First, let's test \(a = 1\):
\[
99 \cdot 1 = 71b + 8c
\]
\[
99 = 71b + 8c
\]

We need to find integers \(b\) and \(c\) such that \(71b + 8c = 99\). Let's test possible values for \(b\):

- If \(b = 1\):
  \[
  71 \cdot 1 + 8c = 99
  \]
  \[
  71 + 8c = 99
  \]
  \[
  8c = 28
  \]
  \[
  c = 3.5 \quad (\text{not an integer})
  \]

- If \(b = 2\):
  \[
  71 \cdot 2 + 8c = 99
  \]
  \[
  142 + 8c = 99
  \]
  \[
  8c = -43 \quad (\text{not possible since } c \geq 0)
  \]

- If \(b = 0\):
  \[
  71 \cdot 0 + 8c = 99
  \]
  \[
  8c = 99 \quad (\text{not possible since } c \leq 9)
  \]

Next, let's test \(a = 2\):
\[
99 \cdot 2 = 71b + 8c
\]
\[
198 = 71b + 8c
\]

We need to find integers \(b\) and \(c\) such that \(71b + 8c = 198\). Let's test possible values for \(b\):

- If \(b = 2\):
  \[
  71 \cdot 2 + 8c = 198
  \]
  \[
  142 + 8c = 198
  \]
  \[
  8c = 56
  \]
  \[
  c = 7
  \]

Thus, \(a = 2\), \(b = 2\), and \(c = 7\) satisfy the equation. Therefore, the three-digit number is:
\[
\underline{a}\,\underline{b}\,\underline{c} = 227
\]

Finally, we verify the solution:
\[
\underline{2}\,\underline{2}\,\underline{7} = 227
\]
\[
\underline{2}\,\underline{7}\,\underline{2}_{\,\text{nine}} = 2 \cdot 81 + 7 \cdot 9 + 2 = 162 + 63 + 2 = 227
\]

Both representations are equal, confirming our solution is correct. Thus, the three-digit number is:
\[
\boxed{227}
\]
