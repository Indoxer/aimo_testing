 The problem: 
Find the three-digit positive integer $\underline{a}\,\underline{b}\,\underline{c}$ whose representation in base nine is $\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\,\underline{a}_{\,\text{nine}},$ where $a,$ $b,$ and $c$ are (not necessarily distinct) digits.


To solve the problem, we need to find a three-digit positive integer \(\underline{a}\,\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\) such that its representation in base nine is \(\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\,\underline{a}_{\,\text{nine}}\). This means that the number \(100a + 10b + c\) in base ten is equal to the number \(81b + 9c + a\) in base nine.

We can set up the equation:
\[100a + 10b + c = 81b + 9c + a.\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[100a - a + 10b - 81b + c - 9c = 0,\]
\[99a - 71b - 8c = 0.\]
This simplifies to:
\[99a = 71b + 8c.\]
Since \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are digits (0 through 9), we need to find values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) that satisfy this equation. Let's test possible values for \(a\).

If \(a = 8\):
\[99 \cdot 8 = 71b + 8c,\]
\[792 = 71b + 8c.\]
We need to find integers \(b\) and \(c\) such that \(71b + 8c = 792\). Testing values for \(b\):
If \(b = 8\):
\[71 \cdot 8 + 8c = 792,\]
\[568 + 8c = 792,\]
\[8c = 224,\]
\[c = 28.\]
Since \(c = 28\) is not a valid digit, \(b = 8\) is not a solution.

If \(b = 7\):
\[71 \cdot 7 + 8c = 792,\]
\[497 + 8c = 792,\]
\[8c = 295,\]
\[c = 36.875.\]
Since \(c\) is not an integer, \(b = 7\) is not a solution.

If \(b = 6\):
\[71 \cdot 6 + 8c = 792,\]
\[426 + 8c = 792,\]
\[8c = 366,\]
\[c = 45.75.\]
Since \(c\) is not an integer, \(b = 6\) is not a solution.

If \(b = 5\):
\[71 \cdot 5 + 8c = 792,\]
\[355 + 8c = 792,\]
\[8c = 437,\]
\[c = 54.625.\]
Since \(c\) is not an integer, \(b = 5\) is not a solution.

If \(b = 4\):
\[71 \cdot 4 + 8c = 792,\]
\[284 + 8c = 792,\]
\[8c = 508,\]
\[c = 63.5.\]
Since \(c\) is not an integer, \(b = 4\) is not a solution.

If \(b = 3\):
\[71 \cdot 3 + 8c = 792,\]
\[213 + 8c = 792,\]
\[8c = 579,\]
\[c = 72.375.\]
Since \(c\) is not an integer, \(b = 3\) is not a solution.

If \(b = 2\):
\[71 \cdot 2 + 8c = 792,\]
\[142 + 8c = 792,\]
\[8c = 650,\]
\[c = 81.25.\]
Since \(c\) is not an integer, \(b = 2\) is not a solution.

If \(b = 1\):
\[71 \cdot 1 + 8c = 792,\]
\[71 + 8c = 792,\]
\[8c = 721,\]
\[c = 90.125.\]
Since \(c\) is not an integer, \(b = 1\) is not a solution.

If \(b = 0\):
\[71 \cdot 0 + 8c = 792,\]
\[8c = 792,\]
\[c = 99.\]
Since \(c\) is not a digit, \(b = 0\) is not a solution.

If \(a = 1\):
\[99 \cdot 1 = 71b + 8c,\]
\[99 = 71b + 8c.\]
Testing values for \(b\):
If \(b = 1\):
\[99 = 71 \cdot 1 + 8c,\]
\[99 = 71 + 8c,\]
\[28 = 8c,\]
\[c = 3.5.\]
Since \(c\) is not an integer, \(b = 1\) is not a solution.

If \(a = 2\):
\[99 \cdot 2 = 71b + 8c,\]
\[198 = 71b + 8c.\]
Testing values for \(b\):
If \(b = 2\):
\[198 = 71 \cdot 2 + 8c,\]
\[198 = 142 + 8c,\]
\[56 = 8c,\]
\[c = 7.\]
So, \(a = 2\), \(b = 2\), and \(c = 7\) is a solution. Therefore, the number is \(227\).

The three-digit positive integer is \(\boxed{227}\).
