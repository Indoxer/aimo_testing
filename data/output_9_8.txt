 The problem: 
Let $w = \dfrac{\sqrt{3} + i}{2}$ and $z = \dfrac{-1 + i\sqrt{3}}{2},$ where $i = \sqrt{-1}.$ Find the number of ordered pairs $(r,s)$ of positive integers not exceeding $100$ that satisfy the equation $i \cdot w^r = z^s.$


To solve the problem, we start by expressing \(w\) and \(z\) in polar form. We know that \(w = \frac{\sqrt{3} + i}{2}\) and \(z = \frac{-1 + i\sqrt{3}}{2}\).

First, let's find the modulus and argument of \(w\):
\[ |w| = \left| \frac{\sqrt{3} + i}{2} \right| = \frac{\sqrt{(\sqrt{3})^2 + 1^2}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3 + 1}}{2} = \frac{2}{2} = 1. \]
The argument of \(w\) is:
\[ \arg(w) = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\right) = \frac{\pi}{6}. \]
So, we can write \(w\) as:
\[ w = e^{i\pi/6}. \]

Next, let's find the modulus and argument of \(z\):
\[ |z| = \left| \frac{-1 + i\sqrt{3}}{2} \right| = \frac{\sqrt{(-1)^2 + (\sqrt{3})^2}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{1 + 3}}{2} = \frac{2}{2} = 1. \]
The argument of \(z\) is:
\[ \arg(z) = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{-1}\right) = \tan^{-1}(-\sqrt{3}) = \frac{2\pi}{3}. \]
So, we can write \(z\) as:
\[ z = e^{i2\pi/3}. \]

Now, we need to solve the equation \(i \cdot w^r = z^s\). Substituting the polar forms, we get:
\[ i \cdot e^{i\pi/6 \cdot r} = e^{i2\pi/3 \cdot s}. \]
Since \(i = e^{i\pi/2}\), we can rewrite the equation as:
\[ e^{i\pi/2} \cdot e^{i\pi/6 \cdot r} = e^{i2\pi/3 \cdot s}, \]
which simplifies to:
\[ e^{i(\pi/2 + \pi/6 \cdot r)} = e^{i2\pi/3 \cdot s}. \]
This implies:
\[ \frac{\pi}{2} + \frac{\pi}{6} r = \frac{2\pi}{3} s + 2k\pi \]
for some integer \(k\). Dividing through by \(\pi\), we get:
\[ \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{6} r = \frac{2}{3} s + 2k. \]
Multiplying through by 6, we obtain:
\[ 3 + r = 4s + 12k. \]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[ r = 4s + 12k - 3. \]
We need \(r\) and \(s\) to be positive integers not exceeding 100. So, we need to find all possible values of \(s\) such that \(r\) is a positive integer not exceeding 100.

For \(r\) to be positive, we need:
\[ 4s + 12k - 3 > 0 \implies 4s + 12k > 3. \]
Since \(s\) and \(k\) are integers, the smallest value for \(s\) is 1. Now, we need to find the range of \(s\):
\[ 4s + 12k - 3 \leq 100 \implies 4s + 12k \leq 103. \]
For the maximum value of \(s\), we consider the case when \(k = 0\):
\[ 4s \leq 103 \implies s \leq 25.75. \]
So, the maximum value for \(s\) is 25. For each value of \(s\) from 1 to 25, \(k\) can take any integer value such that \(4s + 12k - 3 \leq 100\), which simplifies to:
\[ 12k \leq 103 - 4s \implies k \leq \frac{103 - 4s}{12}. \]
Since \(k\) must be a non-negative integer, the maximum value for \(k\) is \(\left\lfloor \frac{103 - 4s}{12} \right\rfloor\). However, since \(k\) can be any non-negative integer, there are exactly 25 possible values for \(s\) (from 1 to 25), and for each \(s\), there is at least one corresponding \(k\) that satisfies the equation.

Therefore, the number of ordered pairs \((r, s)\) is:
\[ \boxed{25}. \]
