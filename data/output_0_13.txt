 The problem: 
Quadratic polynomials $P(x)$ and $Q(x)$ have leading coefficients $2$ and $-2,$ respectively. The graphs of both polynomials pass through the two points $(16,54)$ and $(20,53).$ Find $P(0) + Q(0).$


To find the values of \(P(0)\) and \(Q(0)\), we start by expressing the quadratic polynomials \(P(x)\) and \(Q(x)\) in their general forms:
\[ P(x) = 2x^2 + ax + b \]
\[ Q(x) = -2x^2 + cx + d \]

We know that both polynomials pass through the points \((16, 54)\) and \((20, 53)\). Therefore, we can substitute these points into the equations for \(P(x)\) and \(Q(x)\).

For \(P(x)\):
\[ P(16) = 2(16)^2 + 16a + b = 54 \]
\[ 512 + 16a + b = 54 \]
\[ 16a + b = -458 \quad \text{(1)} \]

\[ P(20) = 2(20)^2 + 20a + b = 53 \]
\[ 800 + 20a + b = 53 \]
\[ 20a + b = -747 \quad \text{(2)} \]

For \(Q(x)\):
\[ Q(16) = -2(16)^2 + 16c + d = 54 \]
\[ -512 + 16c + d = 54 \]
\[ 16c + d = 566 \quad \text{(3)} \]

\[ Q(20) = -2(20)^2 + 20c + d = 53 \]
\[ -800 + 20c + d = 53 \]
\[ 20c + d = 853 \quad \text{(4)} \]

We now solve the system of linear equations (1) and (2) for \(a\) and \(b\):
\[ 16a + b = -458 \]
\[ 20a + b = -747 \]

Subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (20a + b) - (16a + b) = -747 - (-458) \]
\[ 4a = -289 \]
\[ a = -\frac{289}{4} \]

Substitute \(a = -\frac{289}{4}\) back into equation (1):
\[ 16\left(-\frac{289}{4}\right) + b = -458 \]
\[ -1156 + b = -458 \]
\[ b = 698 \]

So, \(P(0) = b = 698\).

Next, we solve the system of linear equations (3) and (4) for \(c\) and \(d\):
\[ 16c + d = 566 \]
\[ 20c + d = 853 \]

Subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (20c + d) - (16c + d) = 853 - 566 \]
\[ 4c = 287 \]
\[ c = \frac{287}{4} \]

Substitute \(c = \frac{287}{4}\) back into equation (3):
\[ 16\left(\frac{287}{4}\right) + d = 566 \]
\[ 1148 + d = 566 \]
\[ d = -582 \]

So, \(Q(0) = d = -582\).

Finally, we find \(P(0) + Q(0)\):
\[ P(0) + Q(0) = 698 + (-582) = 116 \]

Thus, the answer is:
\[ \boxed{116} \]
