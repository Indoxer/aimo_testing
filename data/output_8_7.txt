 The problem: 
In isosceles trapezoid $ABCD$, parallel bases $\overline{AB}$ and $\overline{CD}$ have lengths $500$ and $650$, respectively, and $AD=BC=333$. The angle bisectors of $\angle{A}$ and $\angle{D}$ meet at $P$, and the angle bisectors of $\angle{B}$ and $\angle{C}$ meet at $Q$. Find $PQ$.


To solve for the length of \(PQ\) in the isosceles trapezoid \(ABCD\), we start by analyzing the given information and the properties of the trapezoid.

1. **Identify the coordinates of the vertices:**
   Place \(A\) at \((0, 0)\) and \(B\) at \((500, 0)\). Since \(ABCD\) is an isosceles trapezoid with \(AD = BC = 333\) and \(CD = 650\), we need to find the coordinates of \(C\) and \(D\).

2. **Determine the height of the trapezoid:**
   Drop perpendiculars from \(A\) and \(B\) to \(CD\), meeting \(CD\) at points \(E\) and \(F\) respectively. Since \(ABCD\) is isosceles, \(E\) and \(F\) are symmetric about the midpoint of \(CD\). Therefore, \(CE = FD = \frac{650 - 500}{2} = 75\).

   Now, consider triangle \(ADE\). Using the Pythagorean theorem:
   \[
   AE^2 + DE^2 = AD^2
   \]
   \[
   AE^2 + 75^2 = 333^2
   \]
   \[
   AE^2 + 5625 = 110889
   \]
   \[
   AE^2 = 105264
   \]
   \[
   AE = \sqrt{105264} = 324
   \]

   So, the height of the trapezoid is \(324\).

3. **Find the coordinates of \(C\) and \(D\):**
   Since \(E\) is 75 units away from \(C\) along \(CD\), the coordinates of \(C\) are \((500 + 75, 324) = (575, 324)\). Similarly, the coordinates of \(D\) are \((0 + 75, 324) = (75, 324)\).

4. **Determine the equations of the angle bisectors:**
   The angle bisectors of \(\angle A\) and \(\angle D\) meet at point \(P\), and the angle bisectors of \(\angle B\) and \(\angle C\) meet at point \(Q\). Since the trapezoid is isosceles, the angle bisectors of the angles at the non-parallel sides will intersect at the same distance from the midpoints of the bases.

   The angle bisectors of \(\angle A\) and \(\angle D\) will intersect at a point on the line \(y = 324\) (the height of the trapezoid), and similarly, the angle bisectors of \(\angle B\) and \(\angle C\) will also intersect at a point on the line \(y = 324\).

   The x-coordinate of point \(P\) is the average of the x-coordinates of \(A\) and \(D\):
   \[
   x_P = \frac{0 + 75}{2} = 37.5
   \]

   The x-coordinate of point \(Q\) is the average of the x-coordinates of \(B\) and \(C\):
   \[
   x_Q = \frac{500 + 575}{2} = 537.5
   \]

5. **Calculate the distance \(PQ\):**
   The distance between points \(P\) and \(Q\) is the absolute difference in their x-coordinates:
   \[
   PQ = |x_Q - x_P| = |537.5 - 37.5| = 500
   \]

Thus, the length of \(PQ\) is \(\boxed{500}\).
