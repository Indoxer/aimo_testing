 The problem: 
Three spheres with radii $11$, $13$, and $19$ are mutually externally tangent. A plane intersects the spheres in three congruent circles centered at $A$, $B$, and $C$, respectively, and the centers of the spheres all lie on the same side of this plane. Suppose that $AB^2 = 560$. Find $AC^2$.


To solve the problem, we start by considering the geometry of the situation. We have three spheres with radii \( r_1 = 11 \), \( r_2 = 13 \), and \( r_3 = 19 \) that are mutually externally tangent. The centers of these spheres form a triangle in space. Let's denote the centers of the spheres as \( O_1 \), \( O_2 \), and \( O_3 \).

Since the spheres are mutually externally tangent, the distances between their centers are:
\[
O_1O_2 = r_1 + r_2 = 11 + 13 = 24
\]
\[
O_2O_3 = r_2 + r_3 = 13 + 19 = 32
\]
\[
O_3O_1 = r_3 + r_1 = 19 + 11 = 30
\]

Next, we consider the plane that intersects the spheres in three congruent circles centered at points \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) on the spheres, respectively. The centers \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) are the projections of the centers \( O_1 \), \( O_2 \), and \( O_3 \) onto the plane.

Given that \( AB^2 = 560 \), we need to find \( AC^2 \). Since \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) are the centers of congruent circles, the distances \( O_1A \), \( O_2B \), and \( O_3C \) are all equal to the radius of the spheres minus the distance from the center of the sphere to the plane. Let \( d \) be the perpendicular distance from the center of each sphere to the plane. Then:
\[
O_1A = r_1 - d = 11 - d
\]
\[
O_2B = r_2 - d = 13 - d
\]
\[
O_3C = r_3 - d = 19 - d
\]

The distance between any two of these points \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) is given by the projection of the line segment connecting the centers onto the plane. Using the Pythagorean theorem in the plane, we have:
\[
AB^2 = (O_1A)^2 + (O_2B)^2 - 2 \cdot O_1A \cdot O_2B \cdot \cos(\theta)
\]
where \(\theta\) is the angle between \( O_1A \) and \( O_2B \). However, since \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) are the projections of the centers onto the plane, the angle \(\theta\) is zero, simplifying the equation to:
\[
AB^2 = (O_1A)^2 + (O_2B)^2
\]
Substituting the known values:
\[
560 = (11 - d)^2 + (13 - d)^2
\]
Expanding and simplifying:
\[
560 = (121 - 22d + d^2) + (169 - 26d + d^2)
\]
\[
560 = 290 - 48d + 2d^2
\]
Rearranging terms:
\[
2d^2 - 48d + 290 - 560 = 0
\]
\[
2d^2 - 48d - 270 = 0
\]
Dividing by 2:
\[
d^2 - 24d - 135 = 0
\]

We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \( d = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \):
\[
d = \frac{24 \pm \sqrt{576 + 540}}{2}
\]
\[
d = \frac{24 \pm \sqrt{1116}}{2}
\]
\[
d = \frac{24 \pm 2\sqrt{279}}{2}
\]
\[
d = 12 \pm \sqrt{279}
\]

Since \( d \) must be less than the radii of the spheres, we choose:
\[
d = 12 - \sqrt{279}
\]

Now, we find \( AC^2 \):
\[
AC^2 = (O_1A)^2 + (O_3C)^2 - 2 \cdot O_1A \cdot O_3C \cdot \cos(\phi)
\]
where \(\phi\) is the angle between \( O_1A \) and \( O_3C \). Again, since the angle \(\phi\) is zero, we have:
\[
AC^2 = (O_1A)^2 + (O_3C)^2
\]
Substituting the known values:
\[
AC^2 = (11 - d)^2 + (19 - d)^2
\]
\[
AC^2 = (11 - (12 - \sqrt{279}))^2 + (19 - (12 - \sqrt{279}))^2
\]
\[
AC^2 = (11 - 12 + \sqrt{279})^2 + (19 - 12 + \sqrt{279})^2
\]
\[
AC^2 = (-1 + \sqrt{279})^2 + (7 + \sqrt{279})^2
\]
Expanding both terms:
\[
AC^2 = (1 - 2\sqrt{279} + 279) + (49 + 14\sqrt{279} + 279)
\]
\[
AC^2 = 1 - 2\sqrt{279} + 279 + 49 + 14\sqrt{279} + 279
\]
Combining like terms:
\[
AC^2 = 1 + 49 + 279 + 279 + 12\sqrt{279}
\]
\[
AC^2 = 618
\]

Thus, the value of \( AC^2 \) is:
\[
\boxed{618}
\]
