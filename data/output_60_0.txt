 The problem: 
Every morning Aya goes for a $9$-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at $s+\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop.


<think>
Okay, so I have this problem where Aya goes for a 9-kilometer walk every morning and then stops at a coffee shop. Her walking speed affects how long the entire trip takes, including the time she spends in the coffee shop. The problem gives me two different scenarios with different walking speeds and asks me to find the total time when she walks at a different speed.

First, let's parse the information given:

1. When Aya walks at a constant speed of \( s \) km/h, the entire trip (walking plus coffee shop) takes 4 hours.
2. When she increases her speed to \( s + 2 \) km/h, the entire trip takes 2 hours and 24 minutes.
3. We need to find the total time taken when she walks at \( s + \frac{1}{2} \) km/h, including the same \( t \) minutes spent in the coffee shop.

So, essentially, we're dealing with two equations here because both scenarios involve the same distance walked and the same coffee shop time, just different walking speeds. From these two, we can solve for both \( s \) and \( t \), and then use those values to compute the time when she walks at \( s + \frac{1}{2} \) km/h.

Let me write down what I know more formally.

Let’s denote:
- Distance walked = 9 km.
- Walking speed in first case = \( s \) km/h.
- Total time in first case = 4 hours, which includes \( t \) minutes in the coffee shop.
- Walking speed in second case = \( s + 2 \) km/h.
- Total time in second case = 2 hours and 24 minutes, which is 2.4 hours? Wait, no, 2 hours and 24 minutes is actually 2 + 24/60 = 2.4 hours? Let me check that: 24 divided by 60 is 0.4, so yes, 2.4 hours.

Wait, but hold on. If the total time includes both walking and coffee shop, then in each scenario, the total time is walking time plus coffee shop time \( t \).

But since \( t \) is given in minutes, while the walking times are in hours, I need to be careful about units.

Let me convert all times to hours or all to minutes. Maybe it's easier to work in hours because speed is in km/h.

So, in the first case, total time is 4 hours, which is equal to walking time plus \( t \) hours because \( t \) is currently in minutes. So I should convert \( t \) minutes into hours.

Similarly, in the second case, 2 hours and 24 minutes is 2 + 24/60 = 2.4 hours, as I thought earlier.

Therefore, let me define \( t \) in hours by dividing by 60. Let’s say \( t_{\text{hours}} = \frac{t}{60} \). Then, in both cases, the total time is walking time plus \( t_{\text{hours}} \).

So, formalizing the equations:

Case 1:
Walking speed = \( s \) km/h
Distance = 9 km
Time walking = \( \frac{9}{s} \) hours
Total time = \( \frac{9}{s} + \frac{t}{60} = 4 \) hours

Case 2:
Walking speed = \( s + 2 \) km/h
Distance = 9 km
Time walking = \( \frac{9}{s + 2} \) hours
Total time = \( \frac{9}{s + 2} + \frac{t}{60} = 2.4 \) hours

So now, we have two equations:

1. \( \frac{9}{s} + \frac{t}{60} = 4 \)
2. \( \frac{9}{s + 2} + \frac{t}{60} = 2.4 \)

We can subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate \( \frac{t}{60} \):

\( \left( \frac{9}{s} + \frac{t}{60} \right) - \left( \frac{9}{s + 2} + \frac{t}{60} \right) = 4 - 2.4 \)

Simplify:

\( \frac{9}{s} - \frac{9}{s + 2} = 1.6 \)

So, \( 9 \left( \frac{1}{s} - \frac{1}{s + 2} \right) = 1.6 \)

Compute the difference inside the parentheses:

\( \frac{1}{s} - \frac{1}{s + 2} = \frac{(s + 2) - s}{s(s + 2)} = \frac{2}{s(s + 2)} \)

Thus,

\( 9 * \frac{2}{s(s + 2)} = 1.6 \)

Simplify:

\( \frac{18}{s(s + 2)} = 1.6 \)

Multiply both sides by \( s(s + 2) \):

\( 18 = 1.6 s(s + 2) \)

Divide both sides by 1.6:

\( \frac{18}{1.6} = s(s + 2) \)

Calculating \( \frac{18}{1.6} \):
Well, 1.6 goes into 18 how many times? 1.6 * 10 = 16, so 1.6 * 11 = 17.6, which leaves 0.4. 0.4 /1.6= 0.25, so total is 11.25.

Alternatively, 18 ÷ 1.6 = (18 * 10)/16 = 180 /16 = 45 / 4 = 11.25

Yes, so \( s(s + 2) = 11.25 \)

Which is a quadratic equation:

\( s^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0 \)

We can solve this quadratic equation for \( s \).

Using the quadratic formula:

\( s = \frac{ -b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac} }{2a} \)

Where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), \( c = -11.25 \)

So,

Discriminant: \( b^2 - 4ac = 4 - 4*1*(-11.25) = 4 + 45 = 49 \)

Square root of discriminant: 7

Thus,

\( s = \frac{ -2 \pm 7 }{2} \)

So two solutions:

1. \( s = (-2 + 7)/2 = 5/2 = 2.5 \) km/h
2. \( s = (-2 -7)/2 = -9/2 = -4.5 \) km/h

Since speed cannot be negative, we discard the negative solution.

Therefore, \( s = 2.5 \) km/h.

Now that we have \( s \), we can find \( t \).

Going back to either equation 1 or 2. Let's use equation 1:

\( \frac{9}{s} + \frac{t}{60} = 4 \)

Plug in \( s = 2.5 \):

\( \frac{9}{2.5} + \frac{t}{60} = 4 \)

Calculate \( \frac{9}{2.5} \). Well, 2.5 is 5/2, so 9 divided by (5/2) is 9*(2/5)= 18/5= 3.6

So,

3.6 + \( \frac{t}{60} \) = 4

Subtract 3.6:

\( \frac{t}{60} = 0.4 \)

Multiply both sides by 60:

\( t = 0.4 * 60 = 24 \) minutes

So, \( t = 24 \) minutes.

Just to double-check, let's plug these into equation 2 to make sure.

Equation 2:

\( \frac{9}{s + 2} + \frac{t}{60} = 2.4 \)

With \( s = 2.5 \), \( t = 24 \):

Compute \( s + 2 = 4.5 \) km/h

Compute \( \frac{9}{4.5} = 2 \) hours

Compute \( \frac{24}{60} = 0.4 \) hours

So total time is 2 + 0.4 = 2.4 hours, which matches the second case. Good, so our values are consistent.

Now, moving on to the main question: When Aya walks at \( s + \frac{1}{2} \) km/h, which is \( 2.5 + 0.5 = 3 \) km/h, find the total time including the coffee shop.

So, again, total time will be walking time plus coffee shop time.

Walking speed is now 3 km/h.

Walking time: \( \frac{9}{3} = 3 \) hours.

Coffee shop time: \( t = 24 \) minutes.

Hence, total time is 3 hours and 24 minutes.

But the problem says "find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the \( t \) minutes...", so we need to express the total time in minutes.

Convert 3 hours to minutes: 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

Add the coffee shop time: 180 + 24 = 204 minutes.

Therefore, the total time is 204 minutes.

Wait, before finalizing, let me just ensure that I didn't make any calculation errors.

Starting with walking speed s = 2.5 km/h.

Second case, speed s + 2 = 4.5 km/h, walking time is 2 hours, which is correct as 9 / 4.5 = 2. Then adding 24 minutes coffee shop, gets us to 2h24m, which is 2.4 hours, matching the problem statement.

Then, when she walks at 3 km/h, which is s + 0.5 = 2.5 + 0.5 = 3 km/h, walking time is indeed 3 hours, coffee shop is 24 minutes, total time 3h24m, which is 204 minutes.

So, calculations seem solid.

**Final Answer**
The total time is \boxed{204} minutes.
</think>

Given that Aya walks 9 kilometers every morning and stops at a coffee shop, we need to determine the total time taken when she walks at a speed of \( s + \frac{1}{2} \) km/h. 

First, we set up the equations based on the given scenarios:

1. When Aya walks at \( s \) km/h, the total time (including \( t \) minutes in the coffee shop) is 4 hours:
   \[
   \frac{9}{s} + \frac{t}{60} = 4
   \]

2. When Aya walks at \( s + 2 \) km/h, the total time (including \( t \) minutes in the coffee shop) is 2 hours and 24 minutes (which is 2.4 hours):
   \[
   \frac{9}{s + 2} + \frac{t}{60} = 2.4
   \]

Subtracting the second equation from the first to eliminate \( \frac{t}{60} \):
\[
\frac{9}{s} - \frac{9}{s + 2} = 1.6
\]
\[
9 \left( \frac{1}{s} - \frac{1}{s + 2} \right) = 1.6
\]
\[
9 \left( \frac{2}{s(s + 2)} \right) = 1.6
\]
\[
\frac{18}{s(s + 2)} = 1.6
\]
\[
s(s + 2) = 11.25
\]
Solving the quadratic equation \( s^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0 \) using the quadratic formula:
\[
s = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 45}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm 7}{2}
\]
This gives \( s = 2.5 \) km/h (since speed cannot be negative).

Next, we find \( t \) using the first equation:
\[
\frac{9}{2.5} + \frac{t}{60} = 4
\]
\[
3.6 + \frac{t}{60} = 4
\]
\[
\frac{t}{60} = 0.4 \implies t = 24 \text{ minutes}
\]

Finally, when Aya walks at \( s + \frac{1}{2} = 3 \) km/h, the walking time is:
\[
\frac{9}{3} = 3 \text{ hours}
\]
Adding the coffee shop time of 24 minutes, the total time is:
\[
3 \text{ hours} + 24 \text{ minutes} = 3 \times 60 + 24 = 204 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the total time is \(\boxed{204}\) minutes.
