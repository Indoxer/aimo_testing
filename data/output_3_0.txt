 The problem: 
For any finite set $X$, let $| X |$ denote the number of elements in $X$. Define
\[S_n = \sum | A \cap B | ,\]
where the sum is taken over all ordered pairs $(A, B)$ such that $A$ and $B$ are subsets of $\left\{ 1 , 2 , 3,  \cdots , n \right\}$ with $|A| = |B|$.
For example, $S_2 = 4$ because the sum is taken over the pairs of subsets
\[(A, B) \in \left\{ (\emptyset, \emptyset) , ( \{1\} , \{1\} ), ( \{1\} , \{2\} ) , ( \{2\} , \{1\} ) , ( \{2\} , \{2\} ) , ( \{1 , 2\} , \{1 , 2\} ) \right\} ,\]
giving $S_2 = 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 2 = 4$.
Let $\frac{S_{2022}}{S_{2021}} = \frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find the remainder when $p + q$ is divided by
1000.


Alright, so I have this problem here about computing S_n, which is defined as the sum of |A ∩ B| over all ordered pairs (A, B) where A and B are subsets of {1, 2, ..., n} with |A| = |B|. Then, I need to find the ratio S_{2022}/S_{2021}, express it as a reduced fraction p/q, and then find p + q modulo 1000.

First off, let me try to understand what S_n really represents. For each k from 0 to n, we consider all pairs of subsets A and B where both have exactly k elements. For each such pair, we compute the size of their intersection, |A ∩ B|, and then sum all these sizes together.

So, mathematically, S_n can be written as:

S_n = Σ_{k=0}^n [Σ_{A,B ⊆ {1,...,n}, |A|=|B|=k} |A ∩ B| ]

I think breaking it down like this might help. Maybe I can compute the inner sum for each k and then sum those results across all k.

But how do I compute the inner sum for fixed k?

Let's fix k and consider all ordered pairs (A, B) where |A| = |B| = k. For each such pair, we take the size of their intersection. So, if I can find a way to compute the average value of |A ∩ B| for such pairs, multiplied by the number of pairs, that would give me the inner sum.

Alternatively, perhaps linearity of expectation could help here? Or maybe some combinatorial argument.

Wait, another approach: Instead of thinking about all pairs (A, B), maybe for each element x in {1, 2, ..., n}, determine how many times x is counted in the intersections |A ∩ B|. Because for each x, the total contribution to S_n is the number of pairs (A, B) where x is in both A and B, multiplied by 1 (since each such occurrence adds 1 to |A ∩ B|). So, if I can compute, for each x, the number of pairs (A, B) with |A| = |B| such that x ∈ A and x ∈ B, then multiply that by n (since all elements are symmetric), I should get S_n.

Yes, that sounds promising. Let me formalize that.

For a fixed element x, the number of pairs (A, B) where |A| = |B| and x ∈ A ∩ B is equal to the number of ways to choose A and B such that both contain x, and |A| = |B| = k for some k.

Since the choice is uniform across all k, but actually, for each k, we have C(n-1, k-1)^2 pairs where A and B both include x and have size k.

Therefore, for each k, the number of such pairs is C(n-1, k-1)^2, since we choose k-1 more elements for A and k-1 more for B from the remaining n-1 elements.

Thus, for each x, the total number of pairs (A, B) where x ∈ A ∩ B is Σ_{k=1}^n [C(n-1, k-1)^2].

Wait, but k starts at 1 because when k=0, there are no sets containing x. But actually, for k=0, we'd have just the empty set, which doesn't contain x, so yeah, starting from k=1 makes sense.

But wait, hold on. Actually, the number of subsets A with |A| = k and containing x is C(n-1, k-1). Similarly for B. So, the number of pairs (A, B) with |A| = |B| = k and x ∈ A ∩ B is C(n-1, k-1)^2.

Hence, the total number over all k is Σ_{k=1}^n [C(n-1, k-1)^2]. But note that this sum is equal to Σ_{m=0}^{n-1} [C(n-1, m)^2], where m = k - 1.

But I remember that Σ_{m=0}^{n} [C(n, m)^2] = C(2n, n). This is a well-known identity related to the convolution of binomial coefficients or something like that.

So, in our case, we're summing over m from 0 to n-1, but Σ_{m=0}^{n-1} [C(n-1, m)^2] = C(2(n-1), n-1).

Therefore, for each x, the number of pairs (A, B) where x ∈ A ∩ B is C(2n - 2, n - 1).

Since there are n elements, each contributing C(2n - 2, n - 1) to S_n, the total S_n is n * C(2n - 2, n - 1).

Wait, hold on—is that correct?

Let me verify with the given example, where n = 2.

Compute S_2 according to this formula: n * C(2n - 2, n - 1) = 2 * C(2*2 - 2, 2 - 1) = 2 * C(2, 1) = 2 * 2 = 4.

Which matches the given example! So, that seems correct.

Therefore, in general, S_n = n * C(2n - 2, n - 1).

Cool, so now I have an expression for S_n.

Then, the problem asks for the ratio S_{2022}/S_{2021}.

So, substituting into the formula:

S_{2022} / S_{2021} = [2022 * C(2*2022 - 2, 2022 - 1)] / [2021 * C(2*2021 - 2, 2021 - 1)]

Simplify the arguments inside the binomial coefficients:

C(4042, 2021) / C(4040, 2020)

Because 2*2022 - 2 = 4044 - 2 = 4042; similarly, 2*2021 - 2 = 4040.

So, the ratio becomes:

[2022 * C(4042, 2021)] / [2021 * C(4040, 2020)]

Now, let's write out the binomial coefficients:

C(4042, 2021) = 4042! / (2021! * (4042 - 2021)! ) = 4042! / (2021! * 2021!)

Similarly, C(4040, 2020) = 4040! / (2020! * 2020!)

Therefore, the ratio of the binomial coefficients is:

C(4042, 2021) / C(4040, 2020) = [4042! / (2021! * 2021!)] / [4040! / (2020! * 2020!)] 

Simplify this:

= [4042! * 2020! * 2020!] / [4040! * 2021! * 2021!]

We can write 4042! as 4042 * 4041 * 4040!, so:

= [4042 * 4041 * 4040! * (2020!)^2] / [4040! * (2021!)^2]

Cancel out the 4040! terms:

= [4042 * 4041 * (2020!)^2] / [(2021!)^2]

Note that 2021! = 2021 * 2020!, so:

= [4042 * 4041 * (2020!)^2] / [(2021)^2 * (2020!)^2]

Again, cancel out the (2020!)^2 terms:

= [4042 * 4041] / [2021^2]

So, the ratio simplifies to:

(4042 * 4041) / (2021^2)

Now, plug this back into our expression for S_{2022}/S_{2021}:

= [2022 * (4042 * 4041) / (2021^2)] / 2021

Wait, no. Wait, going back:

The entire ratio is [2022 * C(4042, 2021)] / [2021 * C(4040, 2020)] = 2022/2021 * [C(4042,2021)/C(4040,2020)]

Which we found equals [2022/2021] * [4042 * 4041 / (2021)^2]

So, putting it together:

= (2022 / 2021) * (4042 * 4041) / (2021)^2

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Note that 4042 = 2 * 2021, and 4041 = 2021 + 2020.

So, let's substitute:

4042 = 2 * 2021

4041 = 2021 + 2020

Thus,

Numerator: 4042 * 4041 = (2 * 2021) * (2021 + 2020) = 2 * 2021 * (2021 + 2020)

Denominator: (2021)^2

So,

[ (2 * 2021 * (2021 + 2020)) ] / (2021)^2 = [2 * (2021 + 2020)] / 2021

Because 2021 cancels once in numerator and denominator.

Simplify:

2*(2021 + 2020) / 2021 = 2*(4041)/2021

But wait, 4041 is 2021 + 2020, so yes, that's 4041.

So, this becomes:

2*4041 / 2021

But 4041 divided by 2021 is approximately 2, but let's check:

2021 * 2 = 4042, which is 1 more than 4041, so 4041 = 2021 * 2 - 1.

So, 4041 = 2*2021 - 1.

Therefore,

2*4041 / 2021 = 2*(2*2021 -1)/2021 = (4*2021 - 2)/2021 = 4 - 2/2021.

Wait, that seems complicated. Maybe I made a miscalculation earlier.

Wait, let's see:

We had:

[2 * 4041] / 2021 = [2*(2021 + 2020)] / 2021 = [2*2021 + 2*2020]/2021 = 2 + (4040)/2021

Wait, that's better.

So, 4040 divided by 2021 is 2 exactly, because 2021*2=4042, which is not 4040... Wait, 2021*2=4042, so 4040 = 2021*2 - 2.

Thus, 4040/2021 = 2 - 2/2021.

Therefore, bringing it back:

[2 + (4040)/2021] = 2 + (2 - 2/2021) = 4 - 2/2021.

Wait, so overall, the ratio is:

(2022 / 2021) * [4 - 2/2021]

Hmm, that seems messy. Maybe instead of trying to split up fractions, I should keep it as:

[2022 * (4042 * 4041)] / [2021^3]

Wait, let me retrace the steps:

We had:

S_{2022}/S_{2021} = [2022 * C(4042,2021)] / [2021 * C(4040,2020)]

Which we simplified to:

[2022 / 2021] * [4042 * 4041 / (2021)^2]

Expressed as:

(2022 * 4042 * 4041) / (2021^3)

But 4042 = 2*2021, so substitute:

= (2022 * 2*2021 * 4041) / (2021^3) = (2022 * 2 * 4041) / (2021^2)

Similarly, 2022 = 2021 + 1, so:

= (2*(2021 + 1)*4041) / (2021^2)

Expand the numerator:

= [2*2021*4041 + 2*1*4041] / (2021^2)

= [8166662 + 8082] / (2021^2)

Wait, maybe that's not helpful. Alternatively, factor numerator and denominator:

Wait, 4041 is equal to 2*2020 + 1. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, let's compute the numerator and denominator separately.

Compute numerator: 2022 * 4042 * 4041

But 4042 is 2*2021, so:

= 2022 * 2*2021 * 4041

= 2*2022*2021*4041

Denominator: 2021^3

So, the ratio is (2*2022*2021*4041)/(2021^3) = (2*2022*4041)/(2021^2)

Simplify:

2*2022*4041 / (2021^2)

Note that 2022 = 2021 + 1, and 4041 = 2*2021 -1.

So, plugging in:

2*(2021 + 1)*(2*2021 -1) / (2021^2)

Multiply numerator:

First, multiply (2021 + 1)(2*2021 -1):

= 2021*(2*2021 -1) + 1*(2*2021 -1)

= 2*2021^2 - 2021 + 2*2021 -1

= 2*2021^2 + ( -2021 + 2*2021 ) -1

= 2*2021^2 + 2021 -1

= 2*2021^2 + 2020

Therefore, numerator becomes:

2*(2*2021^2 + 2020) = 4*2021^2 + 4040

So, the ratio is:

(4*2021^2 + 4040) / (2021^2) = 4 + 4040 / (2021^2)

But 4040 = 2*2020, which is 2*(2021 -1). So,

4040 = 2*2021 - 2

Therefore, 4040/(2021^2) = (2*2021 - 2)/2021^2 = 2/2021 - 2/(2021^2)

Thus, the ratio is:

4 + 2/2021 - 2/(2021^2)

But this seems a bit unwieldy. Maybe I should instead perform polynomial division or look for common factors.

Alternatively, perhaps instead of breaking it down, just compute the numerical value.

Wait, but 2021 is a large number, so perhaps we can reduce the fraction before multiplying everything out.

Looking back at S_n = n*C(2n - 2, n -1 ). So, S_{2022}=2022*C(4042,2021); S_{2021}=2021*C(4040,2020).

Therefore, the ratio is (2022 / 2021) * [C(4042,2021)/C(4040,2020)].

Earlier, we computed C(4042,2021)/C(4040,2020)= (4042*4041)/(2021*2021).

Therefore, ratio= (2022 / 2021) * (4042 * 4041)/(2021^2).

Substituting 4042=2*2021, so:

= (2022 / 2021) * (2*2021 * 4041)/(2021^2)

Simplify:

= (2022 / 2021) * (2*4041)/(2021)

= (2022 * 2 * 4041) / (2021^2)

Compute numerator: 2022*2=4044; 4044*4041.

Denominator: 2021^2.

So, the ratio is (4044 * 4041)/(2021^2).

Let me compute 4044*4041 first.

Compute 4044 * 4041:

First, note that 4044 = 2022*2, and 4041=2021*2 -1.

But maybe just multiply them directly:

4044 * 4041.

Let me break it down:

= (4000 + 44) * (4000 + 41)

Using the distributive property:

= 4000*4000 + 4000*41 + 44*4000 + 44*41

Calculate each term:

4000*4000 = 16,000,000

4000*41 = 164,000

44*4000 = 176,000

44*41: Let's compute 40*41=1,640 and 4*41=164, so total 1,640 +164=1,804

Add all together:

16,000,000 + 164,000 = 16,164,000

16,164,000 + 176,000 = 16,340,000

16,340,000 + 1,804 = 16,341,804

So, numerator is 16,341,804.

Denominator is 2021 squared.

Compute 2021^2:

2021 * 2021.

Break it down as (2000 + 21)^2 = 2000^2 + 2*2000*21 + 21^2

= 4,000,000 + 84,000 + 441 = 4,084,441

So, denominator is 4,084,441.

Therefore, the ratio is 16,341,804 / 4,084,441.

Now, we need to simplify this fraction.

First, check if 4,084,441 divides into 16,341,804 evenly. Let's divide 16,341,804 ÷ 4,084,441.

Compute how many times 4,084,441 goes into 16,341,804.

Well, 4,084,441 * 4 = 16,337,764

Subtract that from 16,341,804:

16,341,804 - 16,337,764 = 4,040

So, 4,084,441 * 4 + 4,040 = 16,341,804

So, the fraction is 4 + 4,040 / 4,084,441.

Now, check if 4,040 and 4,084,441 have a common divisor.

Compute GCD(4040, 4084441).

Use Euclidean algorithm:

GCD(4084441, 4040)

Compute 4084441 ÷ 4040: How many times does 4040 go into 4084441.

Well, 4040 * 1000 = 4,040,000

Subtract: 4,084,441 - 4,040,000 = 44,441

Now, GCD(4040, 44,441)

Compute 44,441 ÷ 4040: 4040*11=44,440

Subtract: 44,441 - 44,440 = 1

So, GCD(4040, 1) = 1

Therefore, the fraction reduces to 4 + 4040/4084441, which is already in lowest terms.

Wait, but actually, that was after the initial division. Wait, no—the original fraction was 16,341,804 / 4,084,441, which we expressed as 4 + 4040/4,084,441, and since GCD(4040,4084441)=1, it's 4 + 4040/4084441, so the improper fraction is (4*4,084,441 + 4040)/4,084,441 = (16,337,764 + 4,040)/4,084,441 = 16,341,804 / 4,084,441, which brings us back.

Wait, but I thought GCD(4040,4084441)=1, so the fraction cannot be reduced further. Therefore, the reduced form is 16,341,804 / 4,084,441.

But wait, hold on—let me double-check that GCD(16,341,804, 4,084,441). Since 16,341,804 = 4*4,084,441 + 4,040, and GCD(4,084,441,4,040)=1, as shown above, so yes, the GCD is 1.

Wait, no—if the GCD of numerator and denominator is 1, then the fraction is already in simplest terms. So, p = 16,341,804 and q = 4,084,441.

But 16,341,804 and 4,084,441: Wait, 4,084,441 is 2021², which is a square number, and 16,341,804 is 4*2021² + 4040.

But perhaps I can represent this as a mixed number, but for the purpose of finding p and q, they are co-prime integers, so p = 16,341,804 and q = 4,084,441.

But wait, let me confirm:

Is 16,341,804 / 4,084,441 reducible?

We saw that GCD(16,341,804, 4,084,441) is same as GCD(4,084,441, 4,040), which is 1, so yes, the fraction is reduced.

Therefore, p = 16,341,804 and q = 4,084,441.

Now, compute p + q = 16,341,804 + 4,084,441.

Let me add them:

16,341,804 + 4,084,441.

Adding units digits:

4 +1=5

0+4=4

8+4=12 (carryover 1)

1+8+1=10 (carryover 1)

4+0+1=5

3+4=7

6+0=6

1+ nothing=1

So, writing it out:

16,341,804

+  4,084,441

= 20,426,245

Wait, let me verify:

Start from the right:

4 +1=5

0 +4=4

8 +4=12, carryover 1

1 +8 +1=10, carryover 1

4 +0 +1=5

1 +4=5

3 +0=3

6 remains 6

1 remains 1

So, indeed, 20,426,245.

Therefore, p + q = 20,426,245.

Now, we need to find the remainder when 20,426,245 is divided by 1000.

To find the remainder modulo 1000, we just need the last three digits of the number.

Looking at 20,426,245, the last three digits are 245.

Therefore, the remainder is 245.

So, the answer is 245.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{245}
</think>

To solve the problem, we need to find the ratio \( \frac{S_{2022}}{S_{2021}} \) where \( S_n \) is defined as the sum of \( |A \cap B| \) over all ordered pairs \((A, B)\) such that \( A \) and \( B \) are subsets of \(\{1, 2, \ldots, n\}\) with \(|A| = |B|\). 

First, we derived that \( S_n \) can be expressed as:
\[ S_n = n \cdot \binom{2n - 2}{n - 1} \]

Using this formula, we computed \( S_{2022} \) and \( S_{2021} \):
\[ S_{2022} = 2022 \cdot \binom{4042}{2021} \]
\[ S_{2021} = 2021 \cdot \binom{4040}{2020} \]

Next, we found the ratio:
\[ \frac{S_{2022}}{S_{2021}} = \frac{2022 \cdot \binom{4042}{2021}}{2021 \cdot \binom{4040}{2020}} \]

We simplified the binomial coefficients:
\[ \frac{\binom{4042}{2021}}{\binom{4040}{2020}} = \frac{4042 \cdot 4041}{2021^2} \]

Thus, the ratio becomes:
\[ \frac{2022}{2021} \cdot \frac{4042 \cdot 4041}{2021^2} \]

Simplifying further, we substituted \( 4042 = 2 \cdot 2021 \):
\[ \frac{2022}{2021} \cdot \frac{2 \cdot 2021 \cdot 4041}{2021^2} = \frac{2022 \cdot 2 \cdot 4041}{2021^2} \]

This simplified to:
\[ \frac{4044 \cdot 4041}{2021^2} \]

Calculating the numerator and denominator, we found:
\[ 4044 \cdot 4041 = 16,341,804 \]
\[ 2021^2 = 4,084,441 \]

Thus, the ratio is:
\[ \frac{16,341,804}{4,084,441} \]

Since the fraction is in its simplest form, we have \( p = 16,341,804 \) and \( q = 4,084,441 \). Adding these, we get:
\[ p + q = 16,341,804 + 4,084,441 = 20,426,245 \]

Finally, finding the remainder when 20,426,245 is divided by 1000 gives:
\[ 20,426,245 \mod 1000 = 245 \]

Thus, the answer is:
\[
\boxed{245}
\]
