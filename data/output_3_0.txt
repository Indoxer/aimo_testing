 The problem: 
For any finite set $X$, let $| X |$ denote the number of elements in $X$. Define
\[S_n = \sum | A \cap B | ,\]
where the sum is taken over all ordered pairs $(A, B)$ such that $A$ and $B$ are subsets of $\left\{ 1 , 2 , 3,  \cdots , n \right\}$ with $|A| = |B|$.
For example, $S_2 = 4$ because the sum is taken over the pairs of subsets
\[(A, B) \in \left\{ (\emptyset, \emptyset) , ( \{1\} , \{1\} ), ( \{1\} , \{2\} ) , ( \{2\} , \{1\} ) , ( \{2\} , \{2\} ) , ( \{1 , 2\} , \{1 , 2\} ) \right\} ,\]
giving $S_2 = 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 2 = 4$.
Let $\frac{S_{2022}}{S_{2021}} = \frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find the remainder when $p + q$ is divided by
1000.


Alright, so I have this problem here about calculating S_n, which is a sum over all ordered pairs of subsets (A, B) where |A| = |B|. Each term in the sum is |A ∩ B|. They gave an example for S_2, which was 4, and then they want me to find S_{2022}/S_{2021}, express it as p/q where p and q are coprime, and then find p + q mod 1000.

Hmm, okay. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, understanding what S_n is. For each k from 0 to n, we consider all ordered pairs (A, B) where both A and B are subsets of {1, 2, ..., n} with size k. Then, for each such pair, we take the size of their intersection |A ∩ B| and add all those up. So, S_n is the sum over k=0 to n of the sum over all A,B subsets with |A|=|B|=k of |A ∩ B|.

Got it. So, to compute S_n, I can think of it as summing over each possible subset size k, and then for each k, summing |A ∩ B| over all A, B with |A|=|B|=k.

Let me see if there's a smarter way to compute this instead of enumerating all pairs, which would be computationally intensive even for small n.

Maybe using linearity of expectation or combinatorial arguments? Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of each element and its contribution to the total sum. Since |A ∩ B| counts how many elements are in both A and B, maybe I can compute the expected value of |A ∩ B| over all pairs (A, B) with |A|=|B|=k, multiplied by the number of such pairs.

Wait, actually, since we're summing |A ∩ B| over all such pairs, perhaps it's equal to the number of triples (A, B, x) where x is in A ∩ B, times something. Let me think.

If I fix an element x, then how many pairs (A, B) with |A|=|B|=k have x in A ∩ B?

Well, for each x, the number of subsets A containing x with |A|=k is C(n-1, k-1). Similarly for B. So, the number of pairs (A, B) where both contain x is [C(n-1, k-1)]^2.

Therefore, for each x, the number of pairs where x is in A ∩ B is [C(n-1, k-1)]^2. Therefore, the total contribution of x across all pairs is [C(n-1, k-1)]^2.

Since there are n elements, each contributing equally, the total sum over all pairs for a given k is n * [C(n-1, k-1)]^2.

But wait, hold on. Is that right? Because for each k, the sum over |A ∩ B| is n * [C(n-1, k-1)]^2.

But actually, no. Because for each pair (A, B), |A ∩ B| is the count of x that are in both A and B. Therefore, the total sum over all pairs is equal to the sum over all x of the number of pairs (A, B) with |A|=|B|=k such that x ∈ A ∩ B.

Which is exactly n * [C(n-1, k-1)]^2, as I thought earlier.

So, for each k, the inner sum is n * [C(n-1, k-1)]^2.

Therefore, S_n is the sum over k=0 to n of n * [C(n-1, k-1)]^2.

But when k=0, C(n-1, -1) is zero, so that term doesn't contribute anything. So effectively, S_n is n times the sum over k=1 to n of [C(n-1, k-1)]^2.

But wait, sum over k=1 to n of [C(n-1, k-1)]^2 is equal to the sum over m=0 to n-1 of [C(n-1, m)]^2, which is known to be C(2n - 2, n - 1). That's a standard combinatorial identity: the sum of squares of binomial coefficients C(a, b)^2 is equal to C(2a, a).

Therefore, S_n = n * C(2n - 2, n - 1).

Wow, okay, that simplifies things a lot. So, S_n is n multiplied by the central binomial coefficient C(2n - 2, n - 1). That makes sense.

So, now, S_{2022} / S_{2021} is equal to [2022 * C(4044 - 2, 2022 - 1)] / [2021 * C(4042 - 2, 2021 - 1)].

Wait, let me write that more carefully.

S_n = n * C(2n - 2, n - 1).

Thus,

S_{2022} = 2022 * C(4044 - 2, 2022 - 1) = 2022 * C(4042, 2021)

Similarly,

S_{2021} = 2021 * C(4040, 2020)

Therefore, the ratio is:

[2022 * C(4042, 2021)] / [2021 * C(4040, 2020)]

Now, I need to simplify this ratio.

Recall that C(n, k) = n! / (k! (n - k)! )

Therefore, C(4042, 2021) = 4042! / (2021! * 2021!)

And C(4040, 2020) = 4040! / (2020! * 2020!)

Therefore, C(4042, 2021) / C(4040, 2020) = [4042! / (2021! * 2021!)] / [4040! / (2020! * 2020!)] 

Simplify numerator and denominator:

= [4042! * 2020! * 2020!] / [4040! * 2021! * 2021!]

We can write 4042! = 4042 * 4041 * 4040!

Similarly, 2021! = 2021 * 2020!

Therefore,

= [4042 * 4041 * 4040! * (2020!)^2] / [4040! * (2021 * 2020!)^2]

Simplify terms:

The 4040! cancels out, and one 2020! also cancels.

Thus,

= [4042 * 4041] / [2021 * 2021]

Because (2021 * 2020!)^2 in the denominator becomes 2021^2 * (2020!)^2, but we already canceled one (2020!)^2, so left with 2021^2.

Therefore,

C(4042, 2021) / C(4040, 2020) = (4042 * 4041) / (2021^2)

Simplify numerator:

Note that 4042 = 2 * 2021

Similarly, 4041 = 2021 * 2 - 1, but maybe not helpful.

Wait, 4042 = 2*2021, so 4042 = 2*2021, and 4041 = 4042 - 1 = 2*2021 - 1.

But perhaps better to factor:

4042 * 4041 = (2 * 2021) * (4041)

Similarly, 2021^2 is in the denominator.

But 4041 is equal to 2021 * 2 - 1 = 4042 - 1, which is 4041.

Alternatively, notice that 4041 = 2021 + 2020.

Wait, not sure.

Wait, let's compute 4042 * 4041:

4042 * 4041 = (2 * 2021) * (4041) = 2 * 2021 * 4041

Denominator is 2021^2.

Therefore, (4042 * 4041)/(2021^2) = [2 * 2021 * 4041] / [2021^2] = [2 * 4041] / [2021]

So, simplifying, that gives us 2 * 4041 / 2021.

Compute 4041 divided by 2021:

4041 ÷ 2021. Let me do this division.

2021 * 2 = 4042, which is just 1 more than 4041, so 4041 = 2021 * 2 - 1.

Hence, 4041 = 2*2021 - 1.

Therefore, 2*4041 = 2*(2*2021 - 1) = 4*2021 - 2.

Thus, [2*4041]/2021 = (4*2021 - 2)/2021 = 4 - 2/2021.

So, putting it all together:

C(4042, 2021)/C(4040, 2020) = (2*4041)/2021 = 4 - 2/2021.

But wait, let's verify:

Wait, 2*4041 = 8082.

8082 divided by 2021. Let's see:

2021 * 4 = 8084, which is 2 more than 8082, so 8082 = 2021*4 - 2.

Therefore, 8082 / 2021 = 4 - 2/2021.

Yes, correct.

Therefore, C(4042,2021)/C(4040,2020) = 4 - 2/2021.

So, going back to our ratio:

S_{2022}/S_{2021} = [2022 * C(4042,2021)] / [2021 * C(4040,2020)] = [2022 / 2021] * [C(4042,2021)/C(4040,2020)] = [2022 / 2021] * [4 - 2/2021].

Let me compute this step by step.

First, 2022 / 2021 is 1 + 1/2021.

Second, 4 - 2/2021 is equal to (4*2021 - 2)/2021 = (8084 - 2)/2021 = 8082/2021.

So, multiplying these two fractions:

(1 + 1/2021) * (8082 / 2021) = (2022 / 2021) * (8082 / 2021)

Compute numerator: 2022 * 8082

Denominator: 2021 * 2021

Compute numerator: 2022 * 8082.

Wait, let's compute 2022 * 8082.

But before computing, note that 2022 = 2*1011, and 8082 = 2*4041. Maybe this helps.

But alternatively, factor 2022 and 8082:

2022 = 2 * 3 * 337

8082 = 2 * 3 * 1347. Wait, 1347? Let me check 8082 ÷ 6 = 1347, yes.

But maybe not useful.

Alternatively, use the fact that 2022 * 8082 = (2000 + 22)*(8000 + 82). But that might get messy.

Alternatively, note that 8082 = 2022 * 4 - 2, because 2022*4 = 8088, so 8082 = 8088 - 6 = 2022*4 - 6. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe think in terms of modulo 1000 later, but let's first compute the fraction.

Numerator: 2022 * 8082

Denominator: 2021^2

So, let's compute 2022 * 8082 first.

Compute 2022 * 8082:

Breakdown:

2022 * 8000 = 16,176,000

2022 * 82 = ?

Compute 2022 * 80 = 161,760

Compute 2022 * 2 = 4,044

Add them: 161,760 + 4,044 = 165,804

Therefore, total numerator: 16,176,000 + 165,804 = 16,341,804

Denominator: 2021^2. Compute 2021*2021.

2021^2: Let's compute 2000^2 + 2*2000*21 + 21^2 = 4,000,000 + 84,000 + 441 = 4,084,441.

So, denominator is 4,084,441.

Therefore, the ratio is 16,341,804 / 4,084,441.

Simplify this fraction.

Let me compute GCD of numerator and denominator.

Compute GCD(16,341,804, 4,084,441).

Use Euclidean algorithm.

First, divide 16,341,804 by 4,084,441.

How many times does 4,084,441 go into 16,341,804?

Compute 4,084,441 * 4 = 16,337,764

Subtract from 16,341,804: 16,341,804 - 16,337,764 = 4,040

So, GCD(4,084,441, 4,040)

Now, compute GCD(4,040, 4,084,441 mod 4,040)

Compute 4,084,441 ÷ 4,040.

Find how many times 4,040 goes into 4,084,441.

Well, 4,040 * 1000 = 4,040,000

Subtract: 4,084,441 - 4,040,000 = 44,441

Now, GCD(4,040, 44,441)

Compute 44,441 ÷ 4,040.

4,040 * 11 = 44,440

Subtract: 44,441 - 44,440 = 1

Thus, GCD(4,040, 1) = 1.

Therefore, the fraction cannot be simplified further. So, the ratio is 16,341,804 / 4,084,441.

Therefore, p = 16,341,804 and q = 4,084,441.

But wait, hold on. Earlier, we had S_{2022}/S_{2021} = [2022 * C(4042,2021)] / [2021 * C(4040,2020)] = [2022 / 2021] * [C(4042,2021)/C(4040,2020)] = [2022 / 2021] * [4 - 2/2021]

But then we computed that as 16,341,804 / 4,084,441.

Wait, but 16,341,804 divided by 4,084,441 is equal to approximately 4, since 4 * 4,084,441 is 16,337,764, which is close to 16,341,804. Difference is 16,341,804 - 16,337,764 = 4,040.

So, the exact value is 4 + 4,040 / 4,084,441.

But regardless, we have p = 16,341,804 and q = 4,084,441, and they are coprime.

Wait, but let me double-check whether 16,341,804 and 4,084,441 have any common factors.

Earlier, we saw that GCD is 1, so yes, they are coprime.

Therefore, p = 16,341,804, q = 4,084,441.

Therefore, p + q = 16,341,804 + 4,084,441.

Compute that:

16,341,804 + 4,084,441.

Adding:

16,341,804

+ 4,084,441

= 20,426,245

So, p + q = 20,426,245.

Now, find 20,426,245 mod 1000.

To find the remainder when divided by 1000, we look at the last three digits.

20,426,245 → last three digits are 245.

Hence, the remainder is 245.

So, the final answer is 245.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{245}
</think>

To solve the problem, we need to find the ratio \(\frac{S_{2022}}{S_{2021}}\) where \(S_n\) is defined as the sum over all ordered pairs \((A, B)\) such that \(A\) and \(B\) are subsets of \(\{1, 2, \ldots, n\}\) with \(|A| = |B|\), and each term in the sum is \(|A \cap B|\).

First, we recognize that \(S_n\) can be expressed as:
\[ S_n = n \cdot \binom{2n - 2}{n - 1} \]

Using this formula, we compute \(S_{2022}\) and \(S_{2021}\):
\[ S_{2022} = 2022 \cdot \binom{4042}{2021} \]
\[ S_{2021} = 2021 \cdot \binom{4040}{2020} \]

Next, we need to find the ratio:
\[ \frac{S_{2022}}{S_{2021}} = \frac{2022 \cdot \binom{4042}{2021}}{2021 \cdot \binom{4040}{2020}} \]

Using the properties of binomial coefficients, we simplify:
\[ \frac{\binom{4042}{2021}}{\binom{4040}{2020}} = \frac{4042 \cdot 4041}{2021^2} \]

This simplifies to:
\[ \frac{4042 \cdot 4041}{2021^2} = \frac{2 \cdot 4041}{2021} = 4 - \frac{2}{2021} \]

Thus, the ratio becomes:
\[ \frac{S_{2022}}{S_{2021}} = \frac{2022}{2021} \cdot \left(4 - \frac{2}{2021}\right) \]

Simplifying further, we find:
\[ \frac{S_{2022}}{S_{2021}} = \frac{16,341,804}{4,084,441} \]

Here, \(p = 16,341,804\) and \(q = 4,084,441\). These are coprime, so we compute \(p + q\):
\[ p + q = 16,341,804 + 4,084,441 = 20,426,245 \]

Finally, finding the remainder when 20,426,245 is divided by 1000 gives:
\[ 20,426,245 \mod 1000 = 245 \]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{245}
\]
