 The problem: 
For any finite set $X$, let $| X |$ denote the number of elements in $X$. Define
\[S_n = \sum | A \cap B | ,\]
where the sum is taken over all ordered pairs $(A, B)$ such that $A$ and $B$ are subsets of $\left\{ 1 , 2 , 3,  \cdots , n \right\}$ with $|A| = |B|$.
For example, $S_2 = 4$ because the sum is taken over the pairs of subsets
\[(A, B) \in \left\{ (\emptyset, \emptyset) , ( \{1\} , \{1\} ), ( \{1\} , \{2\} ) , ( \{2\} , \{1\} ) , ( \{2\} , \{2\} ) , ( \{1 , 2\} , \{1 , 2\} ) \right\} ,\]
giving $S_2 = 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 2 = 4$.
Let $\frac{S_{2022}}{S_{2021}} = \frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find the remainder when $p + q$ is divided by
1000.


Alright, so I have this problem about calculating \( S_n \), which is defined as the sum of \( |A \cap B| \) over all ordered pairs of subsets \( (A, B) \) where \( A \) and \( B \) have the same size. Then, I need to find the ratio \( \frac{S_{2022}}{S_{2021}} \) expressed in its simplest form \( \frac{p}{q} \) and compute \( p + q \) modulo 1000.

First, let's try to understand what \( S_n \) represents. For each possible subset size \( k \) from 0 to \( n \), we consider all ordered pairs \( (A, B) \) where both \( A \) and \( B \) are subsets of \( \{1, 2, ..., n\} \) with \( |A| = |B| = k \). For each such pair, we calculate the size of their intersection \( |A \cap B| \) and then sum all these values together.

Given that \( S_n \) involves a double summation over all possible \( k \) and all ordered pairs \( (A, B) \) for each \( k \), maybe I can express it as:

\[
S_n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \sum_{\substack{A,B \subseteq \{1,\ldots,n\} \\ |A| = |B| = k}} |A \cap B|
\]

So, perhaps I can first compute the inner sum for a fixed \( k \), i.e., the sum over all \( (A, B) \) with \( |A| = |B| = k \) of \( |A \cap B| \). Let me denote this inner sum as \( T_k \):

\[
T_k = \sum_{\substack{A,B \subseteq \{1,\ldots,n\} \\ |A| = |B| = k}} |A \cap B|
\]

Therefore, \( S_n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} T_k \).

Now, my task reduces to finding an expression for \( T_k \), then summing over \( k \) to get \( S_n \), and then computing the ratio \( S_{2022}/S_{2021} \).

To compute \( T_k \), let's think combinatorially. For a given element \( i \) in \( \{1, 2, ..., n\} \), how many times does \( i \) appear in \( A \cap B \) across all pairs \( (A, B) \) with \( |A| = |B| = k \)?

If I fix \( i \), the number of pairs \( (A, B) \) where \( i \in A \) and \( i \in B \) is equal to the number of ways to choose the remaining \( k - 1 \) elements of \( A \) from the remaining \( n - 1 \) elements, multiplied by the same for \( B \). So, for each \( i \), the number of such pairs is \( \binom{n-1}{k-1}^2 \).

Since \( |A \cap B| \) is just the sum over all elements \( i \) of the indicator variable whether \( i \in A \cap B \), by linearity of expectation or summations, we can write:

\[
T_k = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \text{Number of pairs } (A, B) \text{ with } i \in A \cap B
\]

Which simplifies to:

\[
T_k = n \times \binom{n - 1}{k - 1}^2
\]

Therefore, the total \( T_k \) is \( n \times \binom{n - 1}{k - 1}^2 \).

Hence, substituting back into \( S_n \):

\[
S_n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} T_k = \sum_{k=0}^{n} n \times \binom{n - 1}{k - 1}^2
\]

Wait a second, hold on. When \( k = 0 \), the binomial coefficient \( \binom{n - 1}{-1} \) is zero, right? Because \( \binom{a}{b} = 0 \) if \( b < 0 \) or \( b > a \). So actually, when \( k = 0 \), \( \binom{n - 1}{k - 1} = \binom{n - 1}{-1} = 0 \). Therefore, the term for \( k = 0 \) is zero, so we can adjust the sum accordingly:

\[
S_n = \sum_{k=1}^{n} n \times \binom{n - 1}{k - 1}^2
\]

But notice that \( \binom{n - 1}{k - 1} \) can be rewritten as \( \binom{n - 1}{(n - 1) - (k - 1)} = \binom{n - 1}{n - k} \). However, I'm not sure if that helps here. Alternatively, perhaps recognizing the sum as related to known combinatorial identities.

In fact, the sum \( \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n - 1}{k - 1}^2 \) is equivalent to \( \sum_{m=-1}^{n - 1} \binom{n - 1}{m}^2 \), but since negative indices give zero, it's effectively \( \sum_{m=0}^{n - 1} \binom{n - 1}{m}^2 \).

We know from combinatorial identities that \( \sum_{m=0}^{r} \binom{r}{m}^2 = \binom{2r}{r} \). This is because \( \sum_{m=0}^{r} \binom{r}{m}^2 = \binom{2r}{r} \). Therefore, in our case, \( r = n - 1 \), so:

\[
\sum_{m=0}^{n - 1} \binom{n - 1}{m}^2 = \binom{2(n - 1)}{n - 1}
\]

Therefore, substituting back into \( S_n \):

\[
S_n = n \times \binom{2(n - 1)}{n - 1}
\]

So, we've simplified \( S_n \) to \( n \times \binom{2(n - 1)}{n - 1} \).

Let me verify this formula with the given example \( S_2 = 4 \).

Compute \( S_2 \) using the formula:

\( n = 2 \),
\( S_2 = 2 \times \binom{2(2 - 1)}{2 - 1} = 2 \times \binom{2}{1} = 2 \times 2 = 4 \).

Yes, that matches the example given. So, the formula seems correct.

Thus, now, we can express \( S_n \) as \( S_n = n \times \binom{2(n - 1)}{n - 1} \).

Now, we need to compute the ratio \( \frac{S_{2022}}{S_{2021}} \).

Expressed using the formula:

\[
\frac{S_{2022}}{S_{2021}} = \frac{2022 \times \binom{2 \times (2022 - 1)}{2022 - 1}}{2021 \times \binom{2 \times (2021 - 1)}{2021 - 1}} = \frac{2022 \times \binom{4042}{2021}}{2021 \times \binom{4040}{2020}}
\]

Simplify this expression.

First, recall that \( \binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k! (n - k)!} \).

So, let's write out \( \binom{4042}{2021} \) and \( \binom{4040}{2020} \):

\[
\binom{4042}{2021} = \frac{4042!}{2021! \times (4042 - 2021)!} = \frac{4042!}{2021! \times 2021!}
\]

Similarly,

\[
\binom{4040}{2020} = \frac{4040!}{2020! \times 2020!}
\]

Therefore, the ratio of the two binomial coefficients is:

\[
\frac{\binom{4042}{2021}}{\binom{4040}{2020}} = \frac{\frac{4042!}{2021! \times 2021!}}{\frac{4040!}{2020! \times 2020!}} = \frac{4042! \times 2020! \times 2020!}{4040! \times 2021! \times 2021!}
\]

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Note that \( 4042! = 4042 \times 4041 \times 4040! \)

Similarly, \( 2021! = 2021 \times 2020! \)

Substituting these into the equation:

\[
\frac{4042 \times 4041 \times 4040! \times (2020!)^2}{4040! \times (2021 \times 2020!)^2} = \frac{4042 \times 4041}{(2021)^2}
\]

Simplify further:

Notice that \( 4042 = 2 \times 2021 \), so:

\[
\frac{2 \times 2021 \times 4041}{(2021)^2} = \frac{2 \times 4041}{2021}
\]

Simplify \( 4041 \div 2021 \):

Calculate \( 4041 ÷ 2021 \). Since 2021 × 2 = 4042, which is 1 more than 4041, so 4041 = 2021 × 2 - 1. Thus,

\[
\frac{2 \times 4041}{2021} = \frac{2 \times (2021 \times 2 - 1)}{2021} = \frac{4 \times 2021 - 2}{2021} = 4 - \frac{2}{2021}
\]

Wait, that doesn't seem helpful. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier.

Wait, going back:

After substituting \( 4042! = 4042 \times 4041 \times 4040! \) and \( 2021! = 2021 \times 2020! \), plug them into the ratio:

\[
\frac{4042 \times 4041 \times 4040! \times (2020!)^2}{4040! \times (2021 \times 2020!)^2} = \frac{4042 \times 4041}{(2021)^2}
\]

Yes, that part was correct. So then, since \( 4042 = 2 \times 2021 \),

\[
\frac{2 \times 2021 \times 4041}{2021^2} = \frac{2 \times 4041}{2021}
\]

So, indeed, \( \frac{2 \times 4041}{2021} \). Let me compute this fraction:

Divide 4041 by 2021:

2021 × 2 = 4042, so 4041 = 2021 × 2 - 1

Therefore,

\[
\frac{2 \times (2021 \times 2 - 1)}{2021} = \frac{4 \times 2021 - 2}{2021} = 4 - \frac{2}{2021}
\]

But wait, that gives us a fractional result, but the ratio \( \frac{S_{2022}}{S_{2021}} \) must be an integer because both \( S_n \) are integers (they're sums of integers). So, clearly, I've made a mistake in the calculation somewhere.

Wait, perhaps my substitution was wrong. Let me go through the steps again.

Starting from the ratio:

\[
\frac{\binom{4042}{2021}}{\binom{4040}{2020}} = \frac{4042! / (2021! \times 2021!)}{4040! / (2020! \times 2020!)} = \frac{4042! \times (2020!)^2}{4040! \times (2021!)^2}
\]

Then, \( 4042! = 4042 \times 4041 \times 4040! \), so replacing:

\[
\frac{4042 \times 4041 \times 4040! \times (2020!)^2}{4040! \times (2021!)^2} = \frac{4042 \times 4041 \times (2020!)^2}{(2021!)^2}
\]

But \( 2021! = 2021 \times 2020! \), so \( (2021!)^2 = (2021)^2 \times (2020!)^2 \). Thus:

\[
\frac{4042 \times 4041 \times (2020!)^2}{(2021)^2 \times (2020!)^2} = \frac{4042 \times 4041}{2021^2}
\]

So yes, that is correct. Now, as before, \( 4042 = 2 \times 2021 \). Therefore:

\[
\frac{2 \times 2021 \times 4041}{2021^2} = \frac{2 \times 4041}{2021}
\]

So, \( \frac{2 \times 4041}{2021} \). But 4041 divided by 2021 is equal to 2 minus something?

Wait, 2021 × 2 = 4042, so 4041 = 4042 - 1 = 2021 × 2 - 1. So:

\[
4041 = 2 \times 2021 - 1
\]

Therefore,

\[
\frac{2 \times (2 \times 2021 - 1)}{2021} = \frac{4 \times 2021 - 2}{2021} = 4 - \frac{2}{2021}
\]

Wait, but this is giving me a fractional value, which cannot be since the ratio of two binomial coefficients should be rational, but actually, it's an integer because they are counts of subsets. Wait, no, actually the ratio itself isn't necessarily an integer—wait, no, actually, \( S_{2022} \) and \( S_{2021} \) are both integers, so their ratio is a rational number, but not necessarily an integer. So, perhaps it is allowed to have a fractional ratio.

But wait, looking back at the original definition of \( S_n \), each term \( |A \cap B| \) is an integer, so \( S_n \) is an integer. Hence, \( S_{2022} \) and \( S_{2021} \) are integers, but their ratio could be a reduced fraction.

But when I computed \( \frac{\binom{4042}{2021}}{\binom{4040}{2020}} \), I obtained \( \frac{2 \times 4041}{2021} \). Hmm, so then, plugging this back into the expression for \( \frac{S_{2022}}{S_{2021}} \):

\[
\frac{S_{2022}}{S_{2021}} = \frac{2022 \times \binom{4042}{2021}}{2021 \times \binom{4040}{2020}} = \frac{2022}{2021} \times \frac{\binom{4042}{2021}}{\binom{4040}{2020}} = \frac{2022}{2021} \times \frac{2 \times 4041}{2021}
\]

Simplify this:

Multiply \( \frac{2022}{2021} \) with \( \frac{2 \times 4041}{2021} \):

\[
\frac{2022 \times 2 \times 4041}{2021 \times 2021} = \frac{2022 \times 2 \times 4041}{2021^2}
\]

Now, note that 2022 = 2021 + 1, so 2022 = 2021 + 1.

Therefore, substitute:

\[
\frac{(2021 + 1) \times 2 \times 4041}{2021^2}
\]

Expand the numerator:

\[
(2021 \times 2 \times 4041) + (1 \times 2 \times 4041)
\]

Which is:

\[
2 \times 4041 \times 2021 + 2 \times 4041
\]

So, the entire expression becomes:

\[
\frac{2 \times 4041 \times 2021 + 2 \times 4041}{2021^2} = \frac{2 \times 4041 (2021 + 1)}{2021^2}
\]

Because 2021 + 1 = 2022, so:

\[
\frac{2 \times 4041 \times 2022}{2021^2}
\]

But 4041 is equal to 2021 * 2 - 1, as before. Maybe we can factor that in?

Alternatively, let's compute the numerator and denominator separately:

Numerator: 2 * 4041 * 2022

Denominator: 2021^2

But perhaps we can simplify the fraction \( \frac{2 \times 4041 \times 2022}{2021^2} \).

Note that 4041 = 2021 * 2 - 1, so:

4041 = 2*2021 -1

Similarly, 2022 = 2021 + 1.

Therefore, numerator:

2*(2*2021 -1)*(2021 +1 )

Let me expand this:

First, multiply (2*2021 -1)(2021 +1):

Use distributive property:

= (2*2021)*(2021 +1) -1*(2021 +1)
= 2*2021^2 + 2*2021 - 2021 -1
= 2*2021^2 + (2*2021 - 2021) -1
= 2*2021^2 + 2021 -1

So, putting it all together:

Numerator = 2*(2*2021^2 + 2021 -1 )

= 4*2021^2 + 2*2021 - 2

Denominator = 2021^2

So, now the entire fraction is:

(4*2021^2 + 2*2021 - 2) / 2021^2

We can separate this into:

4 + (2*2021)/2021^2 - 2/2021^2

Simplify each term:

4 + (2)/2021 - (2)/2021^2

Which is:

4 + \frac{2}{2021} - \frac{2}{2021^2}

Hmm, so that's an expression, but I was hoping to have a single fraction. Perhaps, instead of breaking it down, I should instead factor numerator and denominator.

Wait, another approach: Let me compute the numerator and denominator step by step.

Compute numerator: 2 * 4041 * 2022

Compute denominator: 2021^2

Compute numerator:

First, 2 * 4041 = 8082

Then, 8082 * 2022.

Compute 8082 * 2000 = 16,164,000

Compute 8082 * 22 = ?

8082 * 20 = 161,640

8082 * 2 = 16,164

So, 161,640 + 16,164 = 177,804

So total numerator: 16,164,000 + 177,804 = 16,341,804

Denominator: 2021^2

Compute 2021 * 2021:

2021 * 2000 = 4,042,000

2021 * 21 = 42,441

Total: 4,042,000 + 42,441 = 4,084,441

Therefore, the fraction is \( \frac{16,341,804}{4,084,441} \)

Now, check if this fraction can be simplified.

Find GCD of numerator and denominator.

Compute GCD(16,341,804, 4,084,441)

Using Euclidean algorithm:

Compute 16,341,804 ÷ 4,084,441 = 3 times (since 3*4,084,441 = 12,253,323)

Subtract: 16,341,804 - 12,253,323 = 4,088,481

Now, GCD(4,084,441, 4,088,481)

Compute 4,088,481 - 4,084,441 = 4,040

So, GCD(4,084,441, 4,040)

Compute 4,084,441 ÷ 4,040 = 1010 times (4,040*1010=4,080,400)

Subtract: 4,084,441 - 4,080,400 = 4,041

GCD(4,040, 4,041)

Compute 4,041 - 4,040 = 1

GCD(4,040, 1) = 1

Therefore, the GCD is 1. So, the fraction is already in its simplest form.

Therefore, \( \frac{S_{2022}}{S_{2021}} = \frac{16,341,804}{4,084,441} \)

So, \( p = 16,341,804 \) and \( q = 4,084,441 \). We need to find \( p + q \) mod 1000.

Compute \( p + q = 16,341,804 + 4,084,441 = 20,426,245 \)

Now, compute 20,426,245 mod 1000.

The modulus 1000 takes the last three digits of the number.

Looking at 20,426,245, the last three digits are 245.

Therefore, \( p + q \mod 1000 = 245 \).

Hence, the answer is 245.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{245}
</think>

To solve the problem, we need to find the ratio \(\frac{S_{2022}}{S_{2021}}\) where \(S_n\) is defined as the sum of \(|A \cap B|\) over all ordered pairs \((A, B)\) such that \(A\) and \(B\) are subsets of \(\{1, 2, \ldots, n\}\) with \(|A| = |B|\). 

First, we derived that \(S_n\) can be expressed as:
\[
S_n = n \times \binom{2(n - 1)}{n - 1}
\]

Using this formula, we compute \(S_{2022}\) and \(S_{2021}\):
\[
S_{2022} = 2022 \times \binom{4042}{2021}
\]
\[
S_{2021} = 2021 \times \binom{4040}{2020}
\]

Next, we find the ratio:
\[
\frac{S_{2022}}{S_{2021}} = \frac{2022 \times \binom{4042}{2021}}{2021 \times \binom{4040}{2020}}
\]

Simplifying the ratio of binomial coefficients:
\[
\frac{\binom{4042}{2021}}{\binom{4040}{2020}} = \frac{4042 \times 4041}{2021^2}
\]

This leads to:
\[
\frac{S_{2022}}{S_{2021}} = \frac{2022 \times 2 \times 4041}{2021^2}
\]

Simplifying further, we find that the fraction is already in its simplest form with \(p = 16,341,804\) and \(q = 4,084,441\). 

Finally, we compute \(p + q\) modulo 1000:
\[
p + q = 16,341,804 + 4,084,441 = 20,426,245
\]
\[
20,426,245 \mod 1000 = 245
\]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{245}
\]
