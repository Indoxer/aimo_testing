 The problem: 
A right square pyramid with volume $54$ has a base with side length $6.$ The five vertices of the pyramid all lie on a sphere with radius $\frac mn$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.


Alright, so I have this problem about a right square pyramid. Let me try to visualize it first. A right square pyramid means that the apex is directly above the center of the square base. The base has a side length of 6, and the volume is 54. All five vertices lie on a sphere, and I need to find the radius of that sphere in its simplest fractional form m/n, then compute m + n.

Okay, let's break down what we know:

1. **Base:** It's a square with side length 6. So, each edge of the base is 6 units long.
2. **Volume:** The volume of the pyramid is given as 54.
3. **Pyramid Structure:** Since it's a right pyramid, the apex is directly above the center of the base. So, if we imagine a coordinate system where the base is on the XY-plane and centered at the origin, the apex will be along the Z-axis.
4. **Sphere:** All five vertices (four base corners and the apex) lie on a sphere. That means there exists a sphere such that each vertex is equidistant from the center of the sphere.

So, my goal is to find the radius of this sphere.

Let me recall some formulas:

- **Volume of a pyramid:** Volume = (1/3) * base area * height. We can use this to find the height of the pyramid.
- **Distance formula in 3D:** For a point (x, y, z), the distance from another point (a, b, c) is sqrt[(x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2 + (z - c)^2].
- **Equation of a sphere:** In 3D, the equation is (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 + (z - l)^2 = r^2, where (h, k, l) is the center and r is the radius.

Since all five points lie on the sphere, they must satisfy the sphere's equation. Maybe I can set up equations for these points and solve for the center and radius.

But before that, let me get the coordinates of each vertex.

Let me set up a coordinate system. Let’s place the base of the pyramid on the XY-plane, centered at the origin. So, the four base vertices will be at (3, 3, 0), (3, -3, 0), (-3, 3, 0), (-3, -3, 0). Wait, hold on—is that correct?

Wait, no. If the base is a square with side length 6, then each side goes from -3 to +3 in both x and y directions because 6 divided by 2 is 3. So, yeah, those coordinates make sense. Each corner is 3 units away from the center in both x and y directions.

The apex is directly above the center. Let's denote the apex as (0, 0, h), where h is the height of the pyramid.

Now, we can calculate h using the volume formula.

Given that Volume = 54 = (1/3)*base area*height.

First, compute the base area. Base area = 6 * 6 = 36.

Then, plug into the volume formula:

54 = (1/3)*36*h => 54 = 12*h => h = 54 / 12 = 4.5 or 9/2.

So, the apex is at (0, 0, 9/2).

Alright, so now I have the coordinates for all five vertices:

1. (3, 3, 0)
2. (3, -3, 0)
3. (-3, 3, 0)
4. (-3, -3, 0)
5. (0, 0, 9/2)

All these points lie on a sphere. So, let's assume the sphere has center (p, q, r) and radius R.

Thus, each point satisfies the equation:

(x - p)^2 + (y - q)^2 + (z - r)^2 = R^2

So, plugging in each vertex, we get five equations.

But since the pyramid is symmetric, maybe the sphere's center lies along the pyramid's axis of symmetry, which is the z-axis. Because otherwise, the distances might not be equal. Hmm, that makes sense. So, perhaps the center of the sphere is somewhere along the z-axis, meaning p = 0 and q = 0. So, the center is (0, 0, r). Then, we just have to find r and R.

That simplifies things because we only have two variables: r and R.

So, let's write the equations using this assumption.

For point (3, 3, 0):

(3 - 0)^2 + (3 - 0)^2 + (0 - r)^2 = R^2
=> 9 + 9 + r^2 = R^2
=> 18 + r^2 = R^2  ...(1)

For point (0, 0, 9/2):

(0 - 0)^2 + (0 - 0)^2 + (9/2 - r)^2 = R^2
=> 0 + 0 + (9/2 - r)^2 = R^2
=> (9/2 - r)^2 = R^2  ...(2)

So, from equations (1) and (2), we can set them equal since both equal R^2.

18 + r^2 = (9/2 - r)^2

Let me expand the right-hand side:

(9/2 - r)^2 = (r - 9/2)^2 = r^2 - 2*(9/2)*r + (9/2)^2
= r^2 - 9r + 81/4

Therefore, substituting back into equation:

18 + r^2 = r^2 - 9r + 81/4

Simplify this:

Subtract r^2 from both sides:

18 = -9r + 81/4

Now, let me solve for r.

First, express 18 as 72/4 to have common denominators.

So, 72/4 = -9r + 81/4

Subtract 81/4 from both sides:

72/4 - 81/4 = -9r

(-9/4) = -9r

Divide both sides by -9:

( -9/4 ) / (-9) = r

Simplify:

(9/4)/9 = r => (1/4) = r

So, r = 1/4.

Now, knowing that, let's compute R^2 from equation (1):

R^2 = 18 + r^2 = 18 + (1/4)^2 = 18 + 1/16 = (288/16) + (1/16) = 289/16

Therefore, R = sqrt(289/16) = 17/4.

So, the radius R is 17/4, which is already in its reduced form since 17 and 4 are coprime.

Therefore, m = 17 and n = 4, so m + n = 21.

Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

First, calculated the height correctly: Volume = 54 = (1/3)*36*h => h = 54*3/36 = 9/2. Correct.

Then, assumed the center of the sphere is on the z-axis, so p=q=0. Then wrote equations for two points: base vertex and apex.

Equation (1): (3)^2 + (3)^2 + (0 - r)^2 = R^2 => 18 + r^2 = R^2.

Equation (2): (9/2 - r)^2 = R^2.

Set them equal: 18 + r^2 = (9/2 - r)^2.

Expanded (9/2 - r)^2 correctly: r^2 - 9r + 81/4.

Set 18 + r^2 = r^2 - 9r + 81/4.

Subtract r^2: 18 = -9r + 81/4.

Converted 18 to 72/4: 72/4 - 81/4 = -9r => -9/4 = -9r.

Divided both sides by -9: ( -9/4 ) / (-9) = r => 1/4. Correct.

Then, found R^2 = 18 + (1/4)^2 = 18 + 1/16 = 289/16. So, R = 17/4. Seems correct.

Hence, m + n = 17 + 4 = 21.

I think that's solid. No mistakes noticed upon reviewing.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{21}
</think>

Given a right square pyramid with a base side length of 6 and a volume of 54, we need to find the radius of the sphere on which all five vertices lie. 

First, we calculate the height of the pyramid using the volume formula:
\[
\text{Volume} = \frac{1}{3} \times \text{base area} \times \text{height}
\]
The base area is \(6 \times 6 = 36\). Given the volume is 54, we have:
\[
54 = \frac{1}{3} \times 36 \times \text{height} \implies 54 = 12 \times \text{height} \implies \text{height} = \frac{54}{12} = \frac{9}{2}
\]

Next, we consider the coordinates of the vertices. The base vertices are \((3, 3, 0)\), \((3, -3, 0)\), \((-3, 3, 0)\), \((-3, -3, 0)\), and the apex is \((0, 0, \frac{9}{2})\).

We assume the sphere's center is on the z-axis, so the center is \((0, 0, r)\). Using the distance formula for the sphere, we set up the following equations for the points \((3, 3, 0)\) and \((0, 0, \frac{9}{2})\):

1. For \((3, 3, 0)\):
\[
(3 - 0)^2 + (3 - 0)^2 + (0 - r)^2 = R^2 \implies 9 + 9 + r^2 = R^2 \implies 18 + r^2 = R^2
\]

2. For \((0, 0, \frac{9}{2})\):
\[
(0 - 0)^2 + (0 - 0)^2 + \left(\frac{9}{2} - r\right)^2 = R^2 \implies \left(\frac{9}{2} - r\right)^2 = R^2
\]

Equating the two expressions for \(R^2\):
\[
18 + r^2 = \left(\frac{9}{2} - r\right)^2
\]
Expanding and simplifying:
\[
18 + r^2 = r^2 - 9r + \frac{81}{4}
\]
\[
18 = -9r + \frac{81}{4}
\]
Converting 18 to \(\frac{72}{4}\):
\[
\frac{72}{4} = -9r + \frac{81}{4}
\]
\[
\frac{72}{4} - \frac{81}{4} = -9r
\]
\[
-\frac{9}{4} = -9r \implies r = \frac{1}{4}
\]

Using \(r\) to find \(R\):
\[
R^2 = 18 + \left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^2 = 18 + \frac{1}{16} = \frac{288}{16} + \frac{1}{16} = \frac{289}{16}
\]
\[
R = \sqrt{\frac{289}{16}} = \frac{17}{4}
\]

Thus, the radius is \(\frac{17}{4}\), and \(m + n = 17 + 4 = 21\).

\[
\boxed{21}
\]
