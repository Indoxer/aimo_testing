 The problem: 
Find the three-digit positive integer $\underline{a}\,\underline{b}\,\underline{c}$ whose representation in base nine is $\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\,\underline{a}_{\,\text{nine}},$ where $a,$ $b,$ and $c$ are (not necessarily distinct) digits.


To solve for the three-digit positive integer \(\underline{a}\,\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\) whose representation in base nine is \(\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\,\underline{a}_{\,\text{nine}}\), we start by expressing both numbers in base ten.

The number \(\underline{a}\,\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\) in base ten is:
\[100a + 10b + c.\]

The number \(\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\,\underline{a}_{\,\text{nine}}\) in base ten is:
\[b \cdot 9^2 + c \cdot 9 + a = 81b + 9c + a.\]

We set these two expressions equal to each other:
\[100a + 10b + c = 81b + 9c + a.\]

Rearranging terms, we get:
\[100a - a + 10b - 81b + c - 9c = 0,\]
\[99a - 71b - 8c = 0.\]

This simplifies to:
\[99a = 71b + 8c.\]

Since \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are digits (i.e., integers between 0 and 9), we need to find values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) that satisfy this equation. We start by testing possible values for \(a\).

If \(a = 1\):
\[99 = 71b + 8c.\]
We need to find \(b\) and \(c\) such that \(71b + 8c = 99\). Testing values for \(b\):

If \(b = 1\):
\[99 = 71 \cdot 1 + 8c,\]
\[99 = 71 + 8c,\]
\[28 = 8c,\]
\[c = 3.5.\]
Since \(c\) must be an integer, \(b = 1\) is not a solution.

If \(b = 2\):
\[99 = 71 \cdot 2 + 8c,\]
\[99 = 142 + 8c,\]
\[-43 = 8c,\]
\[c = -5.375.\]
Since \(c\) must be a non-negative integer, \(b = 2\) is not a solution.

If \(b = 3\):
\[99 = 71 \cdot 3 + 8c,\]
\[99 = 213 + 8c,\]
\[-114 = 8c,\]
\[c = -14.25.\]
Since \(c\) must be a non-negative integer, \(b = 3\) is not a solution.

If \(b = 4\):
\[99 = 71 \cdot 4 + 8c,\]
\[99 = 284 + 8c,\]
\[-185 = 8c,\]
\[c = -23.125.\]
Since \(c\) must be a non-negative integer, \(b = 4\) is not a solution.

If \(b = 5\):
\[99 = 71 \cdot 5 + 8c,\]
\[99 = 355 + 8c,\]
\[-256 = 8c,\]
\[c = -32.\]
Since \(c\) must be a non-negative integer, \(b = 5\) is not a solution.

If \(b = 6\):
\[99 = 71 \cdot 6 + 8c,\]
\[99 = 426 + 8c,\]
\[-327 = 8c,\]
\[c = -40.875.\]
Since \(c\) must be a non-negative integer, \(b = 6\) is not a solution.

If \(b = 7\):
\[99 = 71 \cdot 7 + 8c,\]
\[99 = 497 + 8c,\]
\[-408 = 8c,\]
\[c = -51.\]
Since \(c\) must be a non-negative integer, \(b = 7\) is not a solution.

If \(b = 8\):
\[99 = 71 \cdot 8 + 8c,\]
\[99 = 568 + 8c,\]
\[-469 = 8c,\]
\[c = -58.625.\]
Since \(c\) must be a non-negative integer, \(b = 8\) is not a solution.

If \(b = 9\):
\[99 = 71 \cdot 9 + 8c,\]
\[99 = 639 + 8c,\]
\[-540 = 8c,\]
\[c = -67.5.\]
Since \(c\) must be a non-negative integer, \(b = 9\) is not a solution.

If \(a = 2\):
\[198 = 71b + 8c.\]
We need to find \(b\) and \(c\) such that \(71b + 8c = 198\). Testing values for \(b\):

If \(b = 2\):
\[198 = 71 \cdot 2 + 8c,\]
\[198 = 142 + 8c,\]
\[56 = 8c,\]
\[c = 7.\]
Since \(c = 7\) is a valid digit, \(b = 2\) and \(c = 7\) is a solution.

Thus, the three-digit number is \(\underline{2}\,\underline{2}\,\underline{7} = 227\).

Therefore, the answer is:
\[\boxed{227}.\]
