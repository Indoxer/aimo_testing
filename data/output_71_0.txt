 The problem: 
Consider the paths of length $16$ that follow the lines from the lower left corner to the upper right corner on an $8\times 8$ grid. Find the number of such paths that change direction exactly four times, as in the examples shown below.


To solve this, you need to consider the following steps:

1. **Understanding the Problem:** The problem is about counting the number of paths on an 8x8 grid from the lower left to the upper right corner with a specific property: changing direction exactly four times.

2. **Defining Direction Changes:** A path can be described as a sequence of moves either right (R) or up (U). Each time the direction changes from R to U or U to R, it counts as a single direction change. For example, the path RR...RU...RU has two direction changes.

3. **Total Number of Paths:** The total number of paths from the lower left to the upper right without any restrictions is given by the binomial coefficient $\binom{16}{8} = 12870$. However, we are interested in paths with exactly four direction changes.

4. **Characterizing Paths with Four Direction Changes:**
    - Such paths must consist of alternating sequences of right and up moves.
    - Since there are four direction changes, the path will have five segments: starting with either R or U, followed by alternating directions.
    - If the path starts with R, then the segments will be R, U, R, U, R (five segments).
    - If the path starts with U, similarly, the segments will be U, R, U, R, U (five segments).

5. **Counting the Number of Such Paths:**
    - We need to count the number of ways to distribute the 8 right moves and 8 up moves into these five segments while maintaining their alternation.
    - Letâ€™s denote the lengths of these segments as $a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5$, where each $a_i$ is at least 1 since each segment must have at least one move.
    - Since there are 8 right moves, if the path starts with R, then the sum of the odd-indexed segments ($a_1 + a_3 + a_5$) equals 8. Similarly, the sum of the even-indexed segments ($a_2 + a_4$) equals 8.
    - Similarly, if the path starts with U, the sum of the odd-indexed segments ($a_1 + a_3 + a_5$) equals 8 for up moves, and the sum of the even-indexed segments ($a_2 + a_4$) equals 8 for right moves.

6. **Solving the Equations:**
    - For both cases (starting with R or starting with U), we have similar equations:
      - Starting with R: $a_1 + a_3 + a_5 = 8$ and $a_2 + a_4 = 8$
      - Starting with U: $a_1 + a_3 + a_5 = 8$ and $a_2 + a_4 = 8$
    - The number of solutions to $x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_k = n$ with each $x_i \geq 1$ is $\binom{n-1}{k-1}$.
    - Therefore, for the odd segments: number of ways is $\binom{8-1}{3-1} = \binom{7}{2} = 21$
    - For the even segments: number of ways is $\binom{8-1}{2-1} = \binom{7}{1} = 7$
    - Multiply these together for each case: $21 \times 7 = 147$
    - Since the path can start with either R or U, multiply by 2: $147 \times 2 = 294$

Wait, but according to some sources, the correct answer should be 12870 - something, but maybe I made a mistake somewhere. Alternatively, perhaps my initial approach was wrong.

Alternatively, let me think differently. Maybe instead of considering all possible paths and subtracting those with more or fewer direction changes, I should model the problem directly.

So, another way is:

Each path consists of 8 R's and 8 U's. The number of direction changes is equal to the number of times the step switches between R and U. So, for example, a path like RRUURRUU has direction changes at positions 2, 4, 6, so three direction changes. Wait, actually, each switch from R to U or U to R is a direction change. So in RRUURRUU, the first two R's are one segment, then two U's, then two R's, then two U's. So that's four segments, meaning three direction changes? Hmm, no, wait: starting with R, then after two R's, it switches to U, that's one direction change; then after two U's, it switches to R, that's two direction changes; then after two R's, switches to U, that's three direction changes. So yes, three direction changes. But in our problem, we need exactly four direction changes. So how does that correspond?

If a path has exactly four direction changes, it means that it has five segments: starting with either R or U, then alternating four times. So for example, starting with R, the segments would be R, U, R, U, R. So five segments, which would require four direction changes. Similarly, starting with U, it would be U, R, U, R, U.

Therefore, in order to compute the number of such paths, we can model them as sequences of five segments, starting with either R or U, alternating, and each segment having at least one move.

Given that, we need to partition the 8 R's and 8 U's into these five segments, keeping in mind that depending on whether we start with R or U, the distribution of R's and U's differs.

Let me formalize this:

Case 1: Path starts with R.

Then, the segments are R, U, R, U, R. So, the first, third, and fifth segments are R's, totaling 8 R's. The second and fourth segments are U's, totaling 8 U's.

We need to find the number of ways to write 8 as the sum of three positive integers (for the R segments) and 8 as the sum of two positive integers (for the U segments).

Similarly, Case 2: Path starts with U.

Segments are U, R, U, R, U. So, similar reasoning: U segments sum to 8, R segments sum to 8, with U segments split into three parts and R segments into two parts.

In both cases, the number of ways to partition the R's and U's is independent except for the starting direction.

So, for each case, the number of paths is equal to the number of compositions of 8 into 3 parts multiplied by the number of compositions of 8 into 2 parts.

A composition of n into k parts is the number of ways to write n as the sum of k positive integers, which is $\binom{n-1}{k-1}$.

Thus, for the R segments when starting with R: number of compositions is $\binom{8-1}{3-1} = \binom{7}{2} = 21$.

For the U segments when starting with R: number of compositions is $\binom{8-1}{2-1} = \binom{7}{1} = 7$.

Hence, the number of paths starting with R is $21 \times 7 = 147$.

Similarly, for the U segments when starting with U: number of compositions is $\binom{7}{2} = 21$ for U segments.

And for the R segments when starting with U: number of compositions is $\binom{7}{1} = 7$.

Hence, the number of paths starting with U is also $21 \times 7 = 147$.

Adding both cases together, the total number of paths is $147 + 147 = 294$.

But wait, earlier I thought the answer might be different, but 294 seems to make sense based on this reasoning. Let me check if there's another way people approach this problem.

Alternatively, sometimes people use the concept of runs. A run is a consecutive sequence of the same step. So, the number of direction changes is equal to the number of runs minus one.

Therefore, if we have four direction changes, that means five runs. So, in this context, a run could be a series of R's or U's.

So, the problem reduces to counting the number of lattice paths from (0,0) to (8,8) with exactly five runs. Each run alternates between R and U.

Which brings us back to the previous reasoning: starting with R or U, and distributing the steps accordingly.

Another way to think about it is using stars and bars. For the R segments when starting with R, we need to distribute 8 R's into 3 runs, which is equivalent to placing two dividers among 7 gaps between R's, giving $\binom{7}{2} = 21$ ways. Similarly, distributing 8 U's into 2 runs gives 7 ways, hence 21*7=147 for starting with R.

Same logic applies to starting with U, leading to another 147.

Thus, adding both possibilities, 147+147=294.

Therefore, the number of such paths is 294.

**Final Answer**
The number of paths is \boxed{294}.

To solve the problem of finding the number of paths on an \(8 \times 8\) grid from the lower left to the upper right corner that change direction exactly four times, we need to consider the following steps:

1. **Understanding Direction Changes**: A path can be described as a sequence of moves either right (R) or up (U). Each time the direction changes from R to U or U to R, it counts as a single direction change. For example, the path RR...RU...RU has two direction changes.

2. **Characterizing Paths with Four Direction Changes**: Such paths must consist of alternating sequences of right and up moves. Since there are four direction changes, the path will have five segments. If the path starts with R, the segments will be R, U, R, U, R. If the path starts with U, the segments will be U, R, U, R, U.

3. **Counting the Number of Such Paths**:
    - For paths starting with R, we need to distribute 8 right moves and 8 up moves into five segments. The segments for R's will be three segments (summing to 8) and the segments for U's will be two segments (summing to 8).
    - The number of ways to distribute 8 R's into 3 segments is given by the binomial coefficient \(\binom{7}{2} = 21\).
    - The number of ways to distribute 8 U's into 2 segments is given by the binomial coefficient \(\binom{7}{1} = 7\).
    - Therefore, the number of paths starting with R is \(21 \times 7 = 147\).

4. **Considering Paths Starting with U**: Similarly, the number of ways to distribute 8 U's into 3 segments is \(\binom{7}{2} = 21\), and the number of ways to distribute 8 R's into 2 segments is \(\binom{7}{1} = 7\). Thus, the number of paths starting with U is also \(21 \times 7 = 147\).

5. **Total Number of Paths**: Adding the number of paths starting with R and starting with U, we get \(147 + 147 = 294\).

Therefore, the number of such paths is \(\boxed{294}\).
