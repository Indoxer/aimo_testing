 The problem: 
Let $ABCD$ be a parallelogram with $\angle BAD < 90^\circ.$ A circle tangent to sides $\overline{DA},$ $\overline{AB},$ and $\overline{BC}$ intersects diagonal $\overline{AC}$ at points $P$ and $Q$ with $AP < AQ,$ as shown. Suppose that $AP=3,$ $PQ=9,$ and $QC=16.$ Then the area of $ABCD$ can be expressed in the form $m\sqrt{n},$ where $m$ and $n$ are positive integers, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n.$


To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the given information and using properties of the parallelogram and the circle.

First, let's denote the lengths of the sides of the parallelogram \(ABCD\) as follows:
- \(AB = CD = a\)
- \(AD = BC = b\)

Given:
- \(AP = 3\)
- \(PQ = 9\)
- \(QC = 16\)

Since \(P\) and \(Q\) are points where the circle intersects diagonal \(AC\), we have:
\[ AC = AP + PQ + QC = 3 + 9 + 16 = 28 \]

Next, we use the fact that the circle is tangent to sides \(DA\), \(AB\), and \(BC\). This implies that the circle is an excircle of triangle \(ABC\) opposite vertex \(A\). Let \(r\) be the radius of the circle.

The key property of the tangents from a point to a circle is that they are equal in length. Therefore, we can write:
\[ AD = AP + PD = 3 + PD \]
\[ AB = AP + PB = 3 + PB \]
\[ BC = BQ + QC = 9 + 16 = 25 \]

Since \(ABCD\) is a parallelogram, \(AB = CD\) and \(AD = BC\). Thus:
\[ AB = a \]
\[ AD = b \]

From the tangency properties:
\[ b = 3 + PD \]
\[ a = 3 + PB \]
\[ b = 25 \]

Since \(PD = PB\) (tangents from \(P\) to the circle), we have:
\[ 25 = 3 + PD \]
\[ PD = 22 \]

Now, we need to find the area of the parallelogram \(ABCD\). We use the fact that the area of a parallelogram can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Area} = ab \sin(\theta) \]
where \(\theta\) is the angle between sides \(a\) and \(b\).

We also know that the circle is tangent to \(DA\) and \(AB\), and the radius \(r\) can be found using the formula for the area of the parallelogram in terms of the sides and the radius of the inscribed circle:
\[ \text{Area} = r \cdot s \]
where \(s\) is the semiperimeter of the triangle formed by the tangents from \(A\) to the circle.

However, we can also use the fact that the area of the parallelogram can be found using the diagonals and the angle between them. The diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other, so we can use the formula:
\[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot AC \cdot BD \cdot \sin(\phi) \]
where \(\phi\) is the angle between the diagonals.

Given the symmetry and the properties of the tangents, we can simplify this to:
\[ \text{Area} = ab \sin(\theta) \]

Using the given lengths and the properties of the tangents, we can find the exact values of \(a\) and \(b\):
\[ a = 25 \]
\[ b = 25 \]

Thus, the area of the parallelogram is:
\[ \text{Area} = 25 \times 25 \times \sin(60^\circ) = 625 \times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{625\sqrt{3}}{2} \]

Therefore, the area of \(ABCD\) is:
\[ \text{Area} = 625\sqrt{3} \]

Finally, we express the area in the form \(m\sqrt{n}\) and find \(m+n\):
\[ m = 625 \]
\[ n = 3 \]
\[ m + n = 625 + 3 = 628 \]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{628}
\]
