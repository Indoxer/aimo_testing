 The problem: 
Let $\omega\neq 1$ be a 13th root of unity. Find the remainder when
\[\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\omega^k+\omega^{2k})\]
is divided by 1000.


Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000. Here, ω is a 13th root of unity, not equal to 1. Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.

First off, roots of unity often come into play in problems involving polynomials or cyclotomic fields. Since ω is a primitive 13th root of unity, it satisfies the equation ω^13 = 1, and the minimal polynomial for ω over the rationals is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is Φ₁₃(x) = x¹² + x¹¹ + ... + x + 1. That might be useful later.

The expression we're dealing with is a product over k from 0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). Let me denote each term as A_k = 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}. So, our goal is to compute the product P = A₀ * A₁ * ... * A₁₂ modulo 1000.

Wait, hold on. When k=0, ω^0 = 1, so A₀ = 2 - 2*1 + 1² = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1. So actually, the first term is just 1, so the product simplifies to the product from k=1 to 12 of A_k. But maybe I should keep that in mind if needed.

But before anything else, perhaps I can express A_k in a more manageable form. Let's see:

A_k = 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}

Hmm, this looks quadratic in ω^k. Maybe I can factor it or write it differently.

Alternatively, notice that ω^{2k} = (ω^k)^2, so if I let z = ω^k, then A_k becomes 2 - 2z + z². Which factors as (z - 1)^2 + 1? Wait, no, because z² - 2z + 2 is what we have here. Let me check:

z² - 2z + 2 is indeed equal to (z - 1)^2 + 1. So, A_k = z² - 2z + 2 = (z - 1)^2 + 1. That might help later.

Alternatively, maybe complete the square or something. Alternatively, note that z² - 2z + 2 can be written as (z - 1)^2 + 1, but I don't know if that helps directly.

Alternatively, since ω is a root of Φ₁₃(x), which is x¹² + x¹¹ + ... + x + 1 = 0. So, 1 + ω + ω² + ... + ω¹² = 0.

That might come in handy somewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps consider writing A_k in terms of other expressions. For example, let's compute |A_k|², but that might complicate things since we're dealing with complex numbers, unless there's some symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps think of the product as the product over all non-trivial 13th roots of unity of (2 - 2ω + ω²). Wait, but in our case, we have a product over k=0 to 12, which includes ω^0=1 as well. So, A₀ = 1, as I saw earlier, and the rest are for the other roots.

Wait, maybe think of this as evaluating a certain polynomial at specific points?

Let me think: If I have a polynomial f(x) = product_{k=0}^{12} (x - ω^k) = x¹³ - 1, since those are all the roots of x¹³ - 1. But in our case, the product isn't linear in ω^k; instead, it's quadratic in ω^k.

Wait, so perhaps think of f(z) = product_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2z + z²). But wait, no, because in our case, z is specifically ω^k, which are the roots of x¹³ - 1.

Alternatively, perhaps we can write 2 - 2z + z² as z² - 2z + 2, which is similar to a shifted version of the minimal polynomial.

Alternatively, perhaps relate it to another polynomial evaluated at specific points.

Wait, here's an idea: suppose we define a polynomial Q(z) = z² - 2z + 2. Then, our product is the product over k=0 to 12 of Q(ω^k). So, P = product_{k=0}^{12} Q(ω^k).

Now, since ω^k are the roots of x¹³ - 1, perhaps there's a way to evaluate this product using properties of polynomials.

In general, the product over all roots α of a polynomial f(x) of Q(α) is equal to the resultant of f and Q, or can be related to the value of another polynomial at certain points.

Alternatively, recall that if f(x) = product_{k=0}^{n-1} (x - α_k), then product_{k=0}^{n-1} Q(α_k) = result(f, Q), which is the resultant of f and Q.

But computing resultants can be tricky, but maybe there's another way.

Alternatively, use logarithms or something, but that seems messy.

Wait, another thought: If f(x) = x¹³ - 1, then log(f(x)) would be sum_{k=0}^{12} log(x - ω^k), but I don't think that helps here.

Alternatively, perhaps use the fact that the product over k=0}^{12} Q(ω^k) is equal to the absolute value squared of the product over k=0}^{12} sqrt(Q(ω^k)), but that also seems complicated.

Wait, maybe think of it as the product of Q(ω^k) for k=0 to 12. Since ω^k runs through all 13th roots of unity, including 1. So, Q(1) times product_{k=1}^{12} Q(ω^k). Maybe we can find a relationship between these products.

Alternatively, perhaps observe that Q(z) = z² - 2z + 2 can be associated with cyclotomic polynomials or other known polynomials.

Alternatively, note that Q(z) = z² - 2z + 2 = (z - (1 + i))(z - (1 - i)), since discriminant is 4 - 8 = -4, so roots are (2 ± sqrt(-4))/2 = 1 ± i.

So, Q(z) factors as (z - (1 + i))(z - (1 - i)). Therefore, our product P becomes product_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1 + i))(ω^k - (1 - i)).

Which is equal to [product_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1 + i))] * [product_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1 - i))].

So, P = [f(1 + i)] * [f(1 - i)], where f(x) = product_{k=0}^{12} (x - ω^k) = x¹³ - 1.

Therefore, f(1 + i) = (1 + i)^13 - 1, and similarly f(1 - i) = (1 - i)^13 - 1.

Hence, P = [(1 + i)^13 - 1] * [(1 - i)^13 - 1].

So now, we can compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13.

First, let's compute (1 + i)^n and (1 - i)^n. We know that 1 + i has magnitude sqrt(2) and angle π/4. Similarly, 1 - i has magnitude sqrt(2) and angle -π/4.

So, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i * 13 * π/4}.

Similarly, (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{-i * 13 * π/4}.

Compute (sqrt(2))^13: sqrt(2) is 2^(1/2), so (2^(1/2))^13 = 2^(13/2) = 2^6 * 2^(1/2) = 64 * sqrt(2).

Similarly, (1 + i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * [cos(13π/4) + i sin(13π/4)].

Similarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * [cos(-13π/4) + i sin(-13π/4)].

Simplify angles:

13π/4 is equal to 3π + π/4, which is equivalent to π/4 in terms of periodicity, but since 13π/4 = 3π + π/4 = π/4 + 3π, which is equivalent to π/4 + π = 5π/4 after subtracting 2π twice.

Wait, no: 13π/4 divided by 2π is 13/8 ≈ 1.625, so subtract 2π once: 13π/4 - 2π = 13π/4 - 8π/4 = 5π/4.

Similarly, -13π/4 is equivalent to -13π/4 + 4π = (-13π/4 + 16π/4) = 3π/4.

Thus,

(1 + i)^13 = 64√2 [cos(5π/4) + i sin(5π/4)].

And

(1 - i)^13 = 64√2 [cos(3π/4) + i sin(3π/4)].

Compute cos(5π/4) and sin(5π/4): both are -√2/2.

Similarly, cos(3π/4) is -√2/2, sin(3π/4) is √2/2.

Therefore,

(1 + i)^13 = 64√2 (-√2/2 - i√2/2) = 64√2*(-√2/2)(1 + i) = 64*( - (√2 * √2)/2 )(1 + i) = 64*(-2/2)(1 + i) = 64*(-1)(1 + i) = -64(1 + i).

Similarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64√2 (-√2/2 + i√2/2) = 64√2*(-√2/2)(1 - i) = same steps: 64*(-1)(1 - i) = -64(1 - i).

Therefore,

P = [f(1 + i)] * [f(1 - i)] = [(-64)(1 + i) - 1] * [(-64)(1 - i) - 1]

Wait, hold on. Earlier, I had:

f(1 + i) = (1 + i)^13 - 1 = (-64)(1 + i) - 1.

Wait, hold on: No, f(1 + i) = (1 + i)^13 - 1. But (1 + i)^13 was computed as -64(1 + i). So, f(1 + i) = -64(1 + i) - 1 = -64(1 + i) - 1.

Similarly, f(1 - i) = (1 - i)^13 - 1 = -64(1 - i) - 1.

Therefore, P = [ -64(1 + i) - 1 ] * [ -64(1 - i) - 1 ]

Let me compute each term separately.

First, compute -64(1 + i) - 1:

= -64 - 64i - 1 = -65 - 64i.

Similarly, -64(1 - i) -1 = -64 + 64i - 1 = -65 + 64i.

Therefore, P = (-65 - 64i)*(-65 + 64i).

This is the product of a complex number and its conjugate, so it equals the square of the modulus.

Compute modulus squared: (-65)^2 + (64)^2.

Which is 4225 + 4096.

Compute 4225 + 4096:

4225 + 4000 = 8225

8225 + 96 = 8321.

Therefore, P = 8321.

Wait, so the product is 8321. But let me double-check my computations because sometimes I make arithmetic errors.

First, (1 + i)^13: I got -64(1 + i). Let me verify:

(1 + i)^1 = 1 + i

(1 + i)^2 = 2i

(1 + i)^4 = (2i)^2 = -4

(1 + i)^8 = (-4)^2 = 16

Then, (1 + i)^13 = (1 + i)^8 * (1 + i)^4 * (1 + i)^1 = 16 * (-4) * (1 + i) = -64(1 + i). Yes, correct.

Similarly, (1 - i)^13 = -64(1 - i). Correct.

Then, f(1 + i) = (1 + i)^13 - 1 = -64(1 + i) -1.

Which is -64 -64i -1 = -65 -64i. Correct.

Similarly, f(1 - i) = -65 +64i. Correct.

Multiplying (-65 -64i)*(-65 +64i):

Use formula (a - b)(a + b) = a² - b², but here a = -65, b = 64i.

So, (-65)^2 - (64i)^2 = 4225 - (4096 * (-1)) = 4225 + 4096 = 8321. Correct.

So, the product is 8321. Now, the problem asks for the remainder when this product is divided by 1000.

So, compute 8321 mod 1000.

Well, 1000 goes into 8321 eight times (8*1000=8000), leaving 321.

So, 8321 ÷ 1000 = 8 remainder 321.

Therefore, the remainder is 321.

Hence, the answer is 321.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{321}
</think>

Given the problem of finding the remainder when the product \(\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k})\) is divided by 1000, where \(\omega \neq 1\) is a 13th root of unity, we start by analyzing the expression \(A_k = 2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}\).

We recognize that \(\omega^k\) are the 13th roots of unity, including 1. Thus, the product simplifies to considering all roots of the polynomial \(x^{13} - 1 = 0\). 

We rewrite \(A_k\) as a quadratic in \(\omega^k\):
\[ A_k = (\omega^k - (1 + i))(\omega^k - (1 - i)) \]

Thus, the product becomes:
\[ \prod_{k=0}^{12} (\omega^k - (1 + i)) \times \prod_{k=0}^{12} (\omega^k - (1 - i)) \]

Using the polynomial \(f(x) = x^{13} - 1\), we evaluate it at \(1 + i\) and \(1 - i\):
\[ f(1 + i) = (1 + i)^{13} - 1 \]
\[ f(1 - i) = (1 - i)^{13} - 1 \]

We compute the powers of \(1 + i\) and \(1 - i\). Knowing that \(1 + i\) has magnitude \(\sqrt{2}\) and angle \(\pi/4\), we find:
\[ (1 + i)^{13} = 64\sqrt{2} \left( \cos\left(\frac{5\pi}{4}\right) + i \sin\left(\frac{5\pi}{4}\right) \right) = -64(1 + i) \]
\[ (1 - i)^{13} = 64\sqrt{2} \left( \cos\left(\frac{3\pi}{4}\right) + i \sin\left(\frac{3\pi}{4}\right) \right) = -64(1 - i) \]

Thus,
\[ f(1 + i) = -64(1 + i) - 1 = -65 - 64i \]
\[ f(1 - i) = -64(1 - i) - 1 = -65 + 64i \]

The product is:
\[ (-65 - 64i)(-65 + 64i) = (-65)^2 + (64)^2 = 4225 + 4096 = 8321 \]

Finally, we find the remainder when 8321 is divided by 1000:
\[ 8321 \mod 1000 = 321 \]

Thus, the remainder is \(\boxed{321}\).
