 The problem: 
For any finite set $X$, let $| X |$ denote the number of elements in $X$. Define
\[S_n = \sum | A \cap B | ,\]
where the sum is taken over all ordered pairs $(A, B)$ such that $A$ and $B$ are subsets of $\left\{ 1 , 2 , 3,  \cdots , n \right\}$ with $|A| = |B|$.
For example, $S_2 = 4$ because the sum is taken over the pairs of subsets
\[(A, B) \in \left\{ (\emptyset, \emptyset) , ( \{1\} , \{1\} ), ( \{1\} , \{2\} ) , ( \{2\} , \{1\} ) , ( \{2\} , \{2\} ) , ( \{1 , 2\} , \{1 , 2\} ) \right\} ,\]
giving $S_2 = 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 2 = 4$.
Let $\frac{S_{2022}}{S_{2021}} = \frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find the remainder when $p + q$ is divided by
1000.


To solve for \( S_n \), we need to understand the contribution of each element in the set \(\{1, 2, \ldots, n\}\) to the sum \( S_n \). Specifically, we need to count how many times each element appears in the intersection of two subsets of the same size.

Consider an element \( i \) in the set \(\{1, 2, \ldots, n\}\). For a subset \( A \) of size \( k \) that includes \( i \), there are \(\binom{n-1}{k-1}\) ways to choose the remaining \( k-1 \) elements from the remaining \( n-1 \) elements. Similarly, for a subset \( B \) of size \( k \) that also includes \( i \), there are \(\binom{n-1}{k-1}\) ways to choose the remaining \( k-1 \) elements from the remaining \( n-1 \) elements. Therefore, the number of pairs \((A, B)\) such that \( i \in A \cap B \) and \( |A| = |B| = k \) is \(\binom{n-1}{k-1}^2\).

Summing over all possible values of \( k \) from 0 to \( n \), we get:
\[
S_n = \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n-1}{k-1}^2 = \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n-1}{k}^2.
\]
Using the identity \(\sum_{k=0}^m \binom{m}{k}^2 = \binom{2m}{m}\), we have:
\[
S_n = \binom{2(n-1)}{n-1}.
\]
Therefore, we have:
\[
S_{2022} = \binom{4042}{2021} \quad \text{and} \quad S_{2021} = \binom{4040}{2020}.
\]
We need to find the ratio \(\frac{S_{2022}}{S_{2021}}\):
\[
\frac{S_{2022}}{S_{2021}} = \frac{\binom{4042}{2021}}{\binom{4040}{2020}} = \frac{4042! / (2021! \cdot 2021!)}{4040! / (2020! \cdot 2020!)} = \frac{4042 \cdot 4041}{2021 \cdot 2021} = \frac{4042}{2021} = 2.
\]
Thus, we have \( p = 2 \) and \( q = 1 \), so \( p + q = 3 \). The remainder when 3 is divided by 1000 is:
\[
\boxed{3}.
