 The problem: 
For positive integers $a$, $b$, and $c$ with $a < b < c$, consider collections of postage stamps in denominations $a$, $b$, and $c$ cents that contain at least one stamp of each denomination. If there exists such a collection that contains sub-collections worth every whole number of cents up to $1000$ cents, let $f(a, b, c)$ be the minimum number of stamps in such a collection. Find the sum of the three least values of $c$ such that $f(a, b, c) = 97$ for some choice of $a$ and $b$.


Alright, so I came across this interesting problem about postage stamps and coin denominations. It seems a bit complex at first, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

The problem states:

"For positive integers \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) with \( a < b < c \), consider collections of postage stamps in denominations \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) cents that contain at least one stamp of each denomination. If there exists such a collection that contains sub-collections worth every whole number of cents up to 1000 cents, let \( f(a, b, c) \) be the minimum number of stamps in such a collection. Find the sum of the three least values of \( c \) such that \( f(a, b, c) = 97 \) for some choice of \( a \) and \( b \)."

Okay, let's parse this out.

We have three denominations: \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \), where each is a positive integer and \( a < b < c \).

We need to consider collections (i.e., sets) of these stamps that have at least one of each type. So, each collection must include at least one \( a \)-cent stamp, one \( b \)-cent stamp, and one \( c \)-cent stamp.

Moreover, such a collection should be able to form sub-collections that can make every whole number of cents from 1 up to 1000 cents. So, the entire set needs to be a sort of "complete" system in terms of making change up to 1000 cents.

Our goal is to find the minimal total number of stamps required for such a collection, denoted as \( f(a, b, c) \). We need to find the sum of the three smallest values of \( c \) such that \( f(a, b, c) = 97 \) for some \( a \) and \( b \).

So, essentially, we're looking for triplets \( (a, b, c) \) where the minimal number of stamps needed to cover all amounts from 1 to 1000 is exactly 97, and among these triplets, we need the three smallest \( c \) values and then add them up.

Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I recall something called the "coin problem" or the "Frobenius problem," which deals with determining the largest monetary amount that cannot be obtained using any combination of coins of specified denominations. But in this case, it's slightly different because we want to cover every amount up to 1000 cents, not just the largest non-makable amount.

Also, our problem isn't just about covering up to 1000 cents; it's about doing so with the minimal number of stamps, given that we have at least one of each denomination.

So, perhaps we can model this as a covering problem where each stamp contributes its value towards covering certain amounts, and we need to ensure coverage over the entire range.

Given that we have to cover 1 to 1000 cents, and each stamp can contribute multiple amounts when combined with others, the challenge is to arrange the counts of each stamp such that every number in that range can be expressed as a linear combination of the stamp values.

But since we are trying to minimize the total number of stamps, we need an efficient arrangement where each stamp is used as effectively as possible.

Wait, but also, we need at least one of each stamp. So, each \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) must appear at least once.

This adds another layer because we can't just have zero of any stamp; we must have at least one of each.

Therefore, our total number of stamps will be at least 3, but in reality, it's going to be much higher because we need to cover all numbers up to 1000.

I think the key here is to figure out what conditions on \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) would allow us to cover all numbers up to 1000 with the minimal number of stamps, specifically 97.

Given that \( f(a, b, c) = 97 \), which is quite large, maybe \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) are such that they have overlapping ranges of coverage, allowing for efficient coverage of the entire 1-1000 range without requiring too many stamps.

Alternatively, perhaps \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) are such that their greatest common divisor (GCD) is 1, ensuring that beyond a certain point, all numbers can be covered. Since if GCD is greater than 1, you can't cover numbers not divisible by that GCD.

But in this problem, we need to cover every number up to 1000, so the GCD of \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) must be 1. Otherwise, we can't cover all numbers.

Therefore, the first condition is that \( \gcd(a, b, c) = 1 \).

Now, considering that \( a < b < c \), and we need the minimal number of stamps to cover up to 1000, with at least one of each.

Given that \( f(a, b, c) = 97 \), which is a specific number, probably close to the theoretical minimum.

What's the theoretical minimum? Let's see.

In the best case, if we have stamps that can cover consecutive numbers efficiently, like 1, 2, 4, etc., but since we need to have at least one of each, starting with 1 is necessary.

But wait, actually, no, because if we don't have a 1-cent stamp, we can still cover numbers as long as other stamps can combine to make those numbers. However, without a 1-cent stamp, it might complicate things because you can't make 1 cent.

Wait, but in our problem, we must have at least one of each stamp. So, if 1 isn't one of our denominations, do we have to include it?

No, we don't necessarily have to include 1. Wait, hold on.

Wait, re-reading the problem: "collections... that contain at least one stamp of each denomination." So, each collection has at least one \( a \), one \( b \), and one \( c \). So, if we don't have a 1-cent stamp, then we can't make 1 cent unless we have another stamp that can make 1 cent, but since we have to have at least one of each, if 1 is one of the denominations, then it's included. Otherwise, you can't make 1 cent.

Wait, so to make 1 cent, you need at least one 1-cent stamp. Therefore, if \( a \), \( b \), or \( c \) is 1, then you can make 1 cent. Otherwise, you can't.

Hence, to be able to make 1 cent, one of the denominations must be 1. Therefore, either \( a = 1 \), \( b = 1 \), or \( c = 1 \). But since \( a < b < c \), \( a \) must be 1. Otherwise, if \( a \) is greater than 1, then we can't make 1 cent because all stamps are at least 2 cents, but we have to have at least one stamp of each, so all our stamps would be at least 2, meaning we can't make 1 cent.

Therefore, \( a \) must be 1. So, \( a = 1 \).

Therefore, simplifying, \( a = 1 \), \( b \), \( c \) are integers with \( 1 < b < c \).

So, now, the problem reduces to finding triplets \( (1, b, c) \) such that \( f(1, b, c) = 97 \), and then finding the three smallest \( c \) values.

So, moving forward, \( a = 1 \). Therefore, \( f(1, b, c) = 97 \). So, now, we need to find \( b \) and \( c \) such that the minimal number of stamps needed to cover every value from 1 to 1000 is exactly 97.

Since \( a = 1 \), we already have the ability to make any number, but we have to include at least one of each stamp. So, even though with 1s we could make any number, the constraint is that we need to use at least one 1, one \( b \), and one \( c \).

But to minimize the total number of stamps, we need to arrange the counts of 1s, \( b \)'s, and \( c \)'s such that the combination covers all numbers from 1 to 1000 with as few stamps as possible.

Hmm, okay, so since we have 1s, the rest of the coverage can be done efficiently, but the challenge is ensuring that we have enough flexibility to cover all numbers.

Wait, but with 1s, you can cover any number with just the 1s, but since we need to have at least one \( b \) and one \( c \), we might have to adjust the counts accordingly.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Let me think differently.

If we have 1-cent stamps, then theoretically, we can make any number by just using 1s. However, in our case, we have to have at least one \( b \) and one \( c \) as well. So, does having more \( b \) and \( c \) stamps affect the minimal number of stamps needed?

I think yes. Because if we only have one 1, one \( b \), and one \( c \), then the maximum number we can make is \( 1 + b + c \). But we need to go up to 1000, so clearly, we need multiple stamps.

So, the minimal number of stamps, \( f(1, b, c) \), is determined by how efficiently we can cover the numbers from 1 to 1000 with combinations of 1s, \( b \)s, and \( c \)s, while having at least one of each.

To minimize the total number of stamps, we need to maximize the coverage per stamp.

So, ideally, we would use as many high-value stamps as possible to cover larger numbers quickly, but since we must have at least one low-value stamp (the 1s), we need a balance.

Wait, but 1s are essential for being able to reach every number, but they take up a lot of stamps. So, perhaps, to minimize the total number of stamps, we want to maximize the number of high-value stamps while still ensuring that we can fill in the gaps between the high-value stamps with 1s and \( b \)s.

But since we have to have at least one of each, maybe the key is to structure the counts of 1s, \( b \)s, and \( c \)s such that every number can be formed by adding some combination, and the total count is minimized.

But this seems a bit vague. Maybe I need a more systematic approach.

Perhaps I can model this as a covering problem where each stamp can cover certain numbers, and we need to cover all numbers from 1 to 1000 with the minimal number of stamps, given that we must use at least one of each denomination.

Wait, but in this case, the denominations are fixed: 1, \( b \), and \( c \). So, the problem becomes choosing how many 1s, \( b \)s, and \( c \)s to have so that every number from 1 to 1000 can be expressed as a combination of these, and the total number of stamps is 97.

And since we have to have at least one of each, the minimal number of stamps is at least 3, but in our case, it's 97, which is way higher.

So, the question is, how can we distribute the counts of 1s, \( b \)s, and \( c \)s such that the total is 97, and every number from 1 to 1000 can be formed.

Given that, perhaps it's useful to think in terms of the concept of the "covering radius" or the "span" of the stamp denominations.

Alternatively, perhaps thinking in terms of the postage stamp problem, where you want to determine the largest amount that cannot be formed with a given set of stamps, but in our case, we need to cover all amounts up to 1000.

Wait, but the classic postage stamp problem is about the largest amount that cannot be formed, so maybe that's not directly applicable here, but perhaps similar principles can help.

In the postage stamp problem, for two stamps with denominations \( x \) and \( y \), the largest non-formable amount is \( xy - x - y \). But in our case, we have three stamps, and we want to cover all amounts up to 1000.

So, perhaps an extension of the postage stamp problem for three variables.

But I don't recall exact results for three variables off the top of my head.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as a variation of the coin problem where we have coins of 1, \( b \), and \( c \), and we want to cover all amounts up to 1000.

But in the standard coin problem, the goal is to find the largest amount that cannot be formed, but here, we need all amounts up to 1000 to be formable.

So, perhaps, in order to cover all amounts up to 1000, the denominations \( b \) and \( c \) must satisfy certain conditions.

Specifically, if \( b \) is too large relative to 1, then we can't cover the intermediate numbers between \( b \) and \( c \). Similarly, \( c \) must not be too large relative to \( b \) so that the combination of \( b \) and \( c \) can cover the necessary gaps.

Wait, so perhaps the key is that \( b \) and \( c \) should be chosen such that the interval between \( b \) and \( c \) is less than or equal to \( b \), allowing for combinations of \( b \) and \( c \) to fill in the gaps.

But since we have 1s, which can cover single increments, that might mitigate the need for very small gaps.

Wait, but with 1s, you can always cover the gap between any two numbers. So, if you have 1s, you don't really have a gap problem, because 1s can bridge the gaps.

But when you introduce higher denominations, you have to ensure that you don't leave gaps in the coverage.

But in our case, since we have 1s, maybe the only real issue is whether the higher denominations can be used in combination with 1s to cover all the necessary numbers.

Wait, but 1s alone can cover everything, but since we have higher denominations, perhaps it's more efficient.

Wait, no, actually, if you have 1s, you can represent any number by just using the 1s, but if you have additional higher denominations, you can sometimes represent numbers more efficiently.

However, in our problem, we need to have at least one of each denomination, so we can't just have 1s. We must have at least one \( b \) and one \( c \) as well. Therefore, our total number of stamps is 1 (for 1) + 1 (for \( b \)) + 1 (for \( c \)) plus some extra stamps.

Therefore, the minimal number of stamps without considering coverage would be 3, but since we need to cover up to 1000, we need a lot more.

Wait, but the problem says that the collection must contain at least one of each, but beyond that, it's allowed to have more.

So, perhaps, to minimize the number of stamps, we can structure it such that the 1s are used sparsely, but the \( b \)s and \( c \)s are used more frequently to cover larger numbers.

But in reality, since we have to cover all numbers, including the smaller ones, we need sufficient 1s to cover the lower numbers, but perhaps using \( b \)s and \( c \)s cleverly can minimize the total number.

Wait, maybe I can model this as follows:

Suppose we have \( x \) 1s, \( y \) \( b \)s, and \( z \) \( c \)s. Then, the total number of stamps is \( x + y + z = 97 \).

We need to choose \( x, y, z \geq 1 \) such that for every integer \( n \) from 1 to 1000, there exist non-negative integers \( a_1, a_b, a_c \) with \( a_1 + a_b + a_c = k \) such that \( n = a_1 * 1 + a_b * b + a_c * c \).

But this seems a bit abstract.

Alternatively, since we have 1s, perhaps the problem reduces to covering the numbers 1 to 1000 using combinations of 1s, \( b \)s, and \( c \)s, with the minimal total number of stamps, i.e., 97.

But since 1s can cover any residue modulo \( b \) or \( c \), perhaps it's beneficial to design the number of 1s such that each block of size equal to \( b \) or \( c \) can be covered.

Wait, maybe this is getting too vague.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that in order to cover all numbers up to 1000, the number of 1s must be sufficient to cover the residues in the modulus defined by \( b \) and \( c \).

Wait, but this is similar to the concept of the Frobenius number, but extended to three variables.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model it as a linear Diophantine equation problem, where we need to express each number as a combination of 1, \( b \), and \( c \).

But I think without knowing \( b \) and \( c \), it's difficult to model.

Wait, maybe I should think about the problem in terms of the minimal number of stamps needed.

Given that \( f(1, b, c) = 97 \), which is quite large, perhaps \( b \) and \( c \) are such that the minimal number of stamps required is 97, given the constraints.

But since 97 is a prime number, maybe that plays into the selection of \( c \)?

Wait, but 97 is the number of stamps, not the value of \( c \).

Wait, perhaps it's better to consider known results or similar problems.

Wait, I remember that the classic problem where you have stamps of denominations 1, 2, and 5, and you need to cover up to a certain amount, the minimal number of stamps needed can be calculated.

But in our case, it's more general.

Alternatively, perhaps considering that with 1, \( b \), and \( c \), the problem is similar to covering the number line with coins, and we need to cover up to 1000 with the minimal number of coins, but with the added constraint that each coin type must be used at least once.

Wait, but in our problem, it's not about minimizing the number of coins for each amount, but rather having a collection that can make each amount, with the minimal total number of stamps in such a collection.

So, it's a bit different.

Wait, perhaps another angle: For a given triplet \( (1, b, c) \), the minimal number of stamps needed to cover all amounts up to 1000 is 97. Therefore, 97 is the minimal number such that there exists a multiset of 97 stamps with denominations 1, \( b \), and \( c \) (each appearing at least once) that can make every amount from 1 to 1000.

Thus, our task is to find all triplets \( (1, b, c) \) where this minimal number is 97, and then pick the three smallest \( c \) values.

So, perhaps, to find such \( c \), we can look for \( c \) such that when combined with an appropriate \( b \), the minimal number of stamps required is exactly 97.

But how?

Maybe we can relate this to the concept of additive bases.

An additive basis of order h is a set of numbers such that every number can be expressed as the sum of at most h elements from the set.

In our case, the set is {1, b, c}, and h would be related to the maximal number of stamps needed for any number up to 1000.

But since we have a fixed number of stamps (97), it's more about the covering radius.

Wait, perhaps this is getting too abstract.

Alternatively, maybe we can think in terms of the problem's dual: Instead of trying to cover up to 1000 with minimal stamps, maybe we can calculate the maximum number that cannot be covered with 97 stamps, but that seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps we can model this as a linear programming problem, but that's likely overkill.

Wait, maybe it's helpful to note that since 1 is included, we can reach any number by adding 1s, but since we must include at least one \( b \) and one \( c \), we can't rely solely on 1s.

Therefore, perhaps the number of 1s is limited, and the rest of the numbers are covered by \( b \)s and \( c \)s.

So, suppose we have \( x \) 1s, \( y \) \( b \)s, and \( z \) \( c \)s, with \( x + y + z = 97 \), and \( x, y, z \geq 1 \).

Then, the maximum number we can form is \( x*1 + y*b + z*c \).

But we need to cover up to 1000, so \( x + y*b + z*c \geq 1000 \).

But this is a necessary condition, not sufficient.

Additionally, we need to ensure that every number from 1 to 1000 can be formed as a combination of \( x \) 1s, \( y \) \( b \)s, and \( z \) \( c \)s.

Hmm, so both the total coverage and the ability to form every individual number are important.

But since \( x \) is the number of 1s, and we can only use up to \( x \) 1s in any combination, that complicates things.

Wait, perhaps instead of focusing on \( x, y, z \), we can focus on the denominations \( b \) and \( c \), and the number of each.

But without knowing \( x, y, z \), it's difficult.

Wait, maybe another approach: Suppose that the minimal number of stamps is 97, so we have 97 stamps, each being either 1, \( b \), or \( c \), with at least one of each. The total value is at least 1 + \( b \) + \( c \), but can be more depending on the distribution.

But since we need to cover up to 1000, the total value must be at least 1000. But with 97 stamps, the average value per stamp is roughly 1000 / 97 ≈ 10.3. So, the average stamp value is around 10.3.

But since we have a 1-cent stamp, the rest must compensate to reach an average of ~10.3.

So, perhaps \( b \) is around 10 or 11, and \( c \) is higher.

But without precise calculations, this is speculative.

Wait, perhaps it's helpful to think about the problem in terms of the minimal number of each stamp.

Given that we have 97 stamps, with at least one of each denomination, the remaining 94 stamps can be distributed among \( b \) and \( c \).

Suppose we have \( x = 1 \) (number of 1s), \( y = t \), and \( z = 97 - 1 - t \).

Then, the total coverage would be based on how the \( t \) \( b \)s and \( 96 - t \) \( c \)s can cover the numbers from 1 to 1000.

But this seems too vague.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the problem as a variation of the binary representation, but with three digits. Since each stamp can be thought of as a digit in a number system, with base 1 (for 1s), base \( b \), and base \( c \). But again, this is abstract.

Wait, maybe it's better to model this as a mathematical equation.

We need to cover all integers from 1 to 1000 with combinations of 1, \( b \), and \( c \), using at least one of each.

Each number \( n \) can be written as \( n = k_1*1 + k_b*b + k_c*c \), where \( k_1, k_b, k_c \) are non-negative integers, and \( k_1 + k_b + k_c \leq 97 \).

But actually, since the total number of stamps is 97, we have \( k_1 + k_b + k_c = 97 \), but that seems conflicting because we need to cover numbers up to 1000.

Wait, perhaps not. Maybe each number is formed by the specific combination of stamps in the collection.

Wait, maybe confusion arises because we have a fixed number of stamps (97) in the collection, but each number is formed by a subset of those stamps.

Wait, so the collection is a multiset with 97 stamps, each being 1, \( b \), or \( c \), with at least one of each.

Then, for each number \( n \) from 1 to 1000, there must exist a subset of the collection whose total is \( n \).

But the collection is fixed; we cannot change it. So, the collection must be such that every number from 1 to 1000 can be formed by summing some subset of its stamps.

But the collection is a multiset, so you can use multiple copies of each stamp, but in our problem, each stamp is unique—wait, actually, the problem doesn't specify whether stamps are unique or can be duplicated.

Wait, re-reading the problem: "collections... in denominations \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) that contain at least one stamp of each denomination."

So, it's about the types of stamps, not individual physical stamps. So, each collection is a multiset containing some number of \( a \)-cent stamps, some number of \( b \)-cent stamps, and some number of \( c \)-cent stamps, with each type present at least once.

Therefore, the total number of stamps is the sum of the counts of each type. So, the collection is defined by counts \( x, y, z \geq 1 \), such that \( x + y + z = 97 \), and for every \( n \) from 1 to 1000, there exist non-negative integers \( a, b, c \) such that \( a \leq x \), \( b \leq y \), \( c \leq z \), and \( a + b + c = n \).

Wait, no, actually, the interpretation is that each stamp is part of the collection, so each stamp is either an \( a \), \( b \), or \( c \). Therefore, a collection is a multiset with \( x \) \( a \)s, \( y \) \( b \)s, and \( z \) \( c \)s, where \( x + y + z = 97 \), and \( x, y, z \geq 1 \).

Then, the requirement is that for every integer \( n \) from 1 to 1000, there exists a subset of this multiset whose total value is \( n \). So, the subset can consist of any number of \( a \)s, \( b \)s, and \( c \)s, as long as their total is \( n \).

Therefore, the problem reduces to finding triplets \( (x, y, z) \) with \( x + y + z = 97 \), \( x, y, z \geq 1 \), such that every integer from 1 to 1000 can be expressed as \( ax + by + cz \), where \( a \leq x \), \( b \leq y \), \( c \leq z \).

Wait, no, that's not exactly correct.

Wait, actually, each stamp is either included or not in the subset. So, it's more like a subset sum problem where each element can be used at most as many times as it appears in the collection.

So, the collection has \( x \) \( a \)s, \( y \) \( b \)s, \( z \) \( c \)s. Then, for each \( n \), there must be non-negative integers \( a', b', c' \) with \( a' \leq x \), \( b' \leq y \), \( c' \leq z \) such that \( a'a + b'b + c'c = n \).

Therefore, the problem is equivalent to covering the interval [1, 1000] with the subset sums of a multiset containing \( x \) copies of \( a \), \( y \) copies of \( b \), and \( z \) copies of \( c \), with \( x + y + z = 97 \), and \( x, y, z \geq 1 \).

So, the question is, for which triplets \( (a, b, c) \) with \( a = 1 \) (since we established earlier \( a = 1 \) must hold), and \( 1 < b < c \), does there exist such a multiset with \( x + y + z = 97 \) that covers [1, 1000], and then among these, find the ones where \( f(a, b, c) = 97 \), which is the minimal number of stamps needed.

But since \( a = 1 \), the minimal number of stamps is determined by how we choose \( b \) and \( c \). To minimize the number of stamps, we'd want to maximize the number of higher denominations (i.e., use fewer higher denomination stamps to cover larger numbers).

But in our case, the number of stamps is fixed at 97, so we have to choose \( x, y, z \) such that \( x + y + z = 97 \), and the multiset allows covering all numbers up to 1000.

Therefore, the problem is twofold:

1. Choose \( b \) and \( c \) such that with some counts \( x, y, z \geq 1 \), \( x + y + z = 97 \), the multiset can cover [1, 1000].

2. Among all such \( (b, c) \), find those for which \( f(1, b, c) = 97 \).

But how?

Alternatively, perhaps it's useful to model the problem as a covering problem where each stamp can contribute up to its value, and we need to cover all numbers up to 1000.

So, for each \( n \) from 1 to 1000, there must be a combination of \( x \) 1s, \( y \) \( b \)s, and \( z \) \( c \)s that sum to \( n \).

Given that, perhaps the problem is akin to a postage stamp problem with a fixed number of stamps, trying to maximize the range of coverable numbers.

But I'm not sure about the exact solution method.

Wait, perhaps looking for known results.

I recall that in the postage stamp problem with three stamps, the maximum amount that cannot be formed is given by a formula involving the denominations, but in our case, we have a fixed number of stamps and need to cover a range.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is similar to the concept of additive basis, where we need a basis of order h such that every number up to N can be expressed as the sum of at most h elements from the basis.

In our case, the basis consists of 1, \( b \), and \( c \), and h would correspond to the maximum number of stamps used for any number up to 1000.

But since we have a fixed total number of stamps (97), the maximum h is 97, but in reality, we need h to be as low as possible to cover all numbers up to 1000.

But since we're given that \( f(a, b, c) = 97 \), which is the minimal h, so h=97.

Therefore, the minimal number of stamps needed is 97, which suggests that the maximal distance between consecutive coverable numbers is 1, meaning that every number can be covered.

Wait, but in reality, the minimal number of stamps to cover up to N is dependent on the denominations.

Wait, perhaps another approach: The minimal number of stamps needed to cover up to N is bounded below by N divided by the largest denomination, but in our case, the largest denomination is \( c \). So, if we have 97 stamps, the maximum coverage would be 97*c. But since we need to cover up to 1000, we have 97*c >= 1000 => c >= ceiling(1000/97) = ceiling(10.309) = 11. So, \( c \) must be at least 11.

Similarly, since we have 1, \( b \), and \( c \), the number of 1s affects how fine-grained the coverage is.

Wait, but if we have 97 stamps, and \( c \) is 11, then the maximum coverage is 97*11 = 1067, which is more than 1000. So, that works.

But, to cover all numbers up to 1000, we need a proper distribution.

Wait, but with 97 stamps, if \( c = 11 \), then the number of 11s is some number, say z. Each 11 contributes 11 units, but since we have 97 stamps, we can use multiple 11s to cover various numbers.

But to cover all numbers up to 1000, we need to have sufficient coverage both in the low and high end.

Wait, perhaps it's necessary to have the following:

1. At least one 1 to cover 1.

2. The rest of the numbers can be covered by combinations of \( b \) and \( c \), but we need to make sure that the combination of \( b \)s and \( c \)s can cover the necessary gaps.

But since we have 97 stamps, which includes at least one 1, one \( b \), and one \( c \), the remaining 94 stamps can be used to create the necessary coverage.

But perhaps to model it, we can consider that the number of 1s is x, the number of \( b \)s is y, and the number of \( c \)s is z, with x + y + z = 97.

To cover up to 1000, the total value contributed by the stamps is x*1 + y*b + z*c.

But we need to ensure that for every n from 1 to 1000, there exists a subset of the stamps that sums to n.

Given that, perhaps the number of 1s x is significant because 1s can fill in the gaps. But since we need to use at least one 1, x is at least 1.

But to cover up to 1000, we might need a substantial number of 1s or a clever combination with \( b \) and \( c \).

Wait, perhaps the key is to have the number of 1s such that we can cover the numbers 1 through (y*b + z*c), but with the addition of x 1s, we can cover the rest.

But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps this is similar to the concept of the covering radius in coding theory, where you want to cover all vectors within a certain radius.

But again, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to consider that since we have 97 stamps, and we need to cover up to 1000, the average value per stamp is approximately 10.3, so the denominations \( b \) and \( c \) must be around this value.

But \( b \) and \( c \) must be greater than 1, so perhaps \( b \) is around 10 and \( c \) is around 11.

But we need to get precise.

Wait, let's suppose \( c = 97 \). Then, with one \( c \), we can reach up to 97, but we need to reach up to 1000. So, \( c \) must be significantly smaller than 1000, but large enough to help cover the higher numbers when combined with \( b \).

Wait, actually, since we have 97 stamps, the maximum number we can reach is \( x*1 + y*b + z*c \). So, \( x + y*b + z*c \geq 1000 \).

But since \( x + y + z = 97 \), and we have \( x, y, z \geq 1 \), the maximum possible value is \( 97*c \). So, to reach 1000, \( 97*c \geq 1000 \implies c \geq \lceil 1000/97 \rceil = 11 \). So, \( c \geq 11 \).

Therefore, the minimal possible value of \( c \) is 11.

But we need to find the three smallest \( c \) such that \( f(1, b, c) = 97 \).

So, perhaps \( c \) can be 11, 12, 13, etc., and for each \( c \), we can check if there exists a \( b \) such that \( f(1, b, c) = 97 \).

But how do we determine whether \( f(1, b, c) = 97 \)?

Well, perhaps for each \( c \), we can compute the minimal number of stamps needed, which depends on the number of 1s, \( b \)s, and \( c \)s.

But since 1s are essential for covering small numbers, we might need a certain number of 1s.

Wait, let's consider that if we have \( x \) 1s, then we can cover numbers from 1 to \( x \). Then, with \( y \) \( b \)s, we can cover up to \( x + y*b \), and with \( z \) \( c \)s, up to \( x + y*b + z*c \).

But in reality, it's a bit more involved because the combinations can overlap.

Wait, perhaps it's analogous to the concept of additive bases where the basis elements can combine in various ways to cover the entire range.

But without a concrete formula, it's challenging.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think about the problem in terms of the minimal number of each stamp needed to cover the range.

For example, with 1s, to cover numbers up to \( x \), we need at least \( x \) 1s. But since we can combine 1s with other stamps, the number of 1s needed is actually less because they can be used in combination with \( b \)s and \( c \)s.

Wait, perhaps the number of 1s needed is related to the largest gap between consecutive \( b \)s and \( c \)s.

Wait, this is getting too vague.

Wait, perhaps a better idea is to refer to existing literature or known results.

Upon reflection, I recall that in the postage stamp problem with three stamps, the maximum non-representable number can be calculated, but in our case, we're dealing with a fixed number of stamps and needing to cover a range.

Alternatively, perhaps it's helpful to consider the concept of the minimal spanning set.

Wait, maybe stepping back, if we have 97 stamps, with denominations 1, \( b \), and \( c \), and we need to cover up to 1000, the number of each stamp can be calculated based on the required coverage.

Suppose we have \( x \) 1s, \( y \) \( b \)s, and \( z \) \( c \)s. Then, the total value is \( x + y*b + z*c \geq 1000 \).

But since we have \( x + y + z = 97 \), and \( x, y, z \geq 1 \), the minimal total value is \( 1 + b + c \), and the maximum is \( 97*c \).

But we need the total value to be at least 1000, so \( 97*c \geq 1000 \implies c \geq 11 \).

So, \( c \) must be at least 11.

But we need \( c \) such that \( f(1, b, c) = 97 \), so the minimal number of stamps is 97.

Therefore, for each \( c \geq 11 \), we can check if there exists a \( b \) such that with an appropriate distribution of 1s, \( b \)s, and \( c \)s, the minimal number of stamps is 97.

But how?

Wait, perhaps using the concept that with enough 1s, you can cover the small numbers, and then use the \( b \)s and \( c \)s to cover the rest.

So, if we have \( x \) 1s, we can cover 1 to \( x \). Then, each \( b \) can cover \( b \) to \( x + b \), and each \( c \) can cover \( c \) to \( x + c \), but overlapping occurs.

But this is a rough approximation.

Wait, perhaps another way: To cover up to 1000, the number of 1s \( x \) must be sufficient to cover the numbers that can't be covered by \( b \)s and \( c \)s.

But how do we know how many 1s we need?

Wait, in the worst case, without 1s, you can't cover numbers that aren't multiples of \( b \) or \( c \). But with 1s, you can cover those.

But since we have at least one 1, we can cover 1, and then build upon that.

Wait, perhaps the number of 1s needed is equal to the largest number that can't be expressed as a combination of \( b \)s and \( c \)s. But since we have 97 stamps, which is quite a lot, perhaps the number of 1s is not too restrictive.

Wait, but without knowing \( b \) and \( c \), it's hard to pin down.

Alternatively, perhaps I can assume that the number of 1s is 1, which is the minimal, and then see what happens.

If \( x = 1 \), then \( y + z = 96 \). Then, the total value is \( 1 + y*b + z*c \geq 1000 \implies y*b + z*c \geq 999 \).

But since \( y + z = 96 \), the maximum possible value is \( 96*c \), so \( 96*c \geq 999 \implies c \geq ceiling(999 / 96) ≈ 10.406 \implies c \geq 11 \).

Which is consistent with our previous conclusion.

But with \( x = 1 \), we can cover 1, but we can't cover numbers beyond 1 unless we have more 1s or other denominations.

Wait, but with just one 1, we can cover 1, but not 2, unless we have a 2-cent stamp.

But in our case, we don't have a 2-cent stamp unless \( b = 2 \).

Wait, so if \( b = 2 \), then we can cover 2 with one \( b \), but if \( b > 2 \), we can't cover 2 unless we have a 1 and a \( b \), but since we have only one 1, we can cover 2 as 1 + 1, but we don't have two 1s unless \( x \geq 2 \).

Wait, so if \( x = 1 \), we can only cover 1, and then numbers beyond 1 can only be covered by \( b \)s and \( c \)s, but since \( b \) and \( c \) are larger than 1, we can't cover 2 without having two 1s.

Therefore, if \( x = 1 \), we can't cover all numbers up to 1000 unless \( b \) or \( c \) can cover the missing numbers.

But since \( b \) and \( c \) are larger than 1, the numbers between 2 and \( b - 1 \) can't be covered unless we have multiple 1s.

But we only have one 1, so we can't cover 2, 3, ..., \( b - 1 \). Therefore, \( b \) must be 2.

But \( b \) must be greater than 1, so \( b = 2 \).

Wait, so with \( x = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), then we can cover 1, 2, and then 3 can be covered as 1 + 2, 4 as 2 + 2, etc., but without multiple 1s or 2s, we can't cover those.

Wait, actually, since we have only one 1 and one 2, we can only cover 1, 2, and 3 (1+2), but not 4, because we don't have two 2s or two 1s.

Therefore, with \( x = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), \( y = 1 \), \( z = 95 \), we can cover 1, 2, 3, but not 4. So, to cover 4, we need another 1 or another 2.

But since we have only one 1 and one 2, we can't. Therefore, \( x \) must be greater than 1.

Wait, so perhaps \( x = 2 \), then we can cover 1, 2, 3 (1+2), but still, without more 1s or 2s, we can't cover higher numbers beyond that.

Wait, no, actually, with two 1s, you can cover 1, 2 (either as a single 2 or two 1s), and 3 (1+2 or three 1s). But since we only have one 2, we can only form 2 once.

Wait, this is getting convoluted.

Perhaps, in reality, to cover all numbers up to 1000, the number of 1s must be such that every number can be expressed as a combination of 1s, \( b \)s, and \( c \)s.

But with only one 1, it's impossible to cover all numbers beyond \( b \) or \( c \) without multiple 1s.

Therefore, perhaps we need to have a number of 1s such that \( x \) is at least the maximal gap between \( b \) and \( c \).

Wait, that is, if the denominations are \( 1, b, c \), then the maximal gap between consecutive numbers covered by \( b \) and \( c \) is \( b - 1 \). Therefore, to cover all numbers, we need \( x \geq b - 1 \), so that the 1s can fill in the gaps between the \( b \)s and \( c \)s.

But since we have a limited number of 1s, this may not be feasible unless \( b \) is small.

Wait, but if \( b \) is too small, say \( b = 2 \), then \( x \geq 1 \), which is manageable.

Wait, if \( b = 2 \), then the maximal gap is 1, so \( x \geq 1 \). Which is satisfied since \( x \geq 1 \).

But if \( b = 3 \), then the maximal gap is 2, so \( x \geq 2 \).

Similarly, if \( b = 4 \), then \( x \geq 3 \), and so on.

Therefore, in general, for a given \( b \), the minimal number of 1s needed is \( b - 1 \).

Therefore, if we have \( x = b - 1 \), we can cover all numbers up to \( b \), and then beyond that, we can use the \( b \)s and \( c \)s.

But in our case, we have \( x + y + z = 97 \), so \( x = b - 1 \), \( y \), \( z \geq 1 \).

Therefore, \( (b - 1) + y + z = 97 \implies y + z = 98 - b \).

Then, the total value contributed by \( b \)s and \( c \)s is \( y*b + z*c \).

But since \( y + z = 98 - b \), the total value is \( y*b + z*c = y*b + (98 - b - y)*c \).

But we need this total value to be at least \( 1000 - x = 1000 - (b - 1) = 1001 - b \).

Therefore, \( y*b + (98 - b - y)*c \geq 1001 - b \).

Simplify:

\( y*b + (98 - b - y)*c \geq 1001 - b \)

Let me write this as:

\( y*(b - c) + (98 - b)*c \geq 1001 - b \)

Rearranged:

\( y*(b - c) \geq 1001 - b - (98 - b)*c \)

But this seems messy.

Alternatively, perhaps expressing it as:

\( y*b + z*c \geq 1001 - b \)

With \( z = 98 - b - y \)

So,

\( y*b + (98 - b - y)*c \geq 1001 - b \)

Let me factor:

\( y*(b - c) + (98 - b)*c \geq 1001 - b \)

So,

\( y*(b - c) \geq 1001 - b - (98 - b)*c \)

Compute right-hand side:

\( 1001 - b - (98 - b)*c \)

= \( 1001 - b - 98c + b*c \)

= \( 1001 - 98c + b*(c - 1) \)

So,

\( y*(b - c) \geq 1001 - 98c + b*(c - 1) \)

This is getting too algebraic, maybe another approach.

Alternatively, think of \( y \) and \( z \) as variables. Since \( y + z = 98 - b \), we can express \( z = 98 - b - y \).

Substituting into the inequality:

\( y*b + (98 - b - y)*c \geq 1001 - b \)

Expanding:

\( y*b + 98c - b*c - y*c \geq 1001 - b \)

Factor \( y \):

\( y*(b - c) + 98c - b*c \geq 1001 - b \)

Bring constants to the RHS:

\( y*(b - c) \geq 1001 - b - 98c + b*c \)

= \( y*(b - c) \geq 1001 - b - 98c + b*c \)

Hmm, same as before.

So, perhaps solving for \( y \):

\( y \geq \frac{1001 - b - 98c + b*c}{b - c} \)

Assuming \( b > c \), which it is, so \( b - c > 0 \).

But this expression is still quite complex.

Alternatively, maybe try plugging in some values for \( c \) and \( b \) to see if it works.

Suppose \( c = 11 \), the minimal value.

Then, the total value contributed by \( b \)s and \( c \)s must be at least \( 1001 - b \).

Given \( c = 11 \), then the equation becomes:

\( y*b + z*11 \geq 1001 - b \)

With \( y + z = 98 - b \)

So, substituting \( z = 98 - b - y \):

\( y*b + (98 - b - y)*11 \geq 1001 - b \)

Expand:

\( y*b + 1078 - 11b - 11y \geq 1001 - b \)

Combine like terms:

\( y*(b - 11) + 1078 - 11b \geq 1001 - b \)

Move constants to RHS:

\( y*(b - 11) \geq 1001 - b - 1078 + 11b \)

Simplify:

\( y*(b - 11) \geq (1001 - 1078) + (-b + 11b) \)

= \( y*(b - 11) \geq -77 + 10b \)

So,

\( y \geq \frac{-77 + 10b}{b - 11} \)

Simplify numerator:

\( -77 + 10b = 10b - 77 \)

Denominator:

\( b - 11 \)

So,

\( y \geq \frac{10b - 77}{b - 11} \)

Divide numerator and denominator:

\( \frac{10b - 77}{b - 11} = 10 + \frac{(-77 + 110)}{b - 11} = 10 + \frac{33}{b - 11} \)

Therefore,

\( y \geq 10 + \frac{33}{b - 11} \)

Since \( y \) must be an integer, \( \frac{33}{b - 11} \) must be less than or equal to 1 for \( y \) to be minimal.

Wait, but \( b > c = 11 \), so \( b \geq 12 \).

Thus, \( b - 11 \geq 1 \), so \( \frac{33}{b - 11} \leq 33 \).

But that gives \( y \geq 10 + \text{something} \), which is not particularly helpful.

Wait, perhaps plugging in specific \( b \) values:

Case 1: \( b = 12 \)

Then, \( y \geq 10 + 33/(12 - 11) = 10 + 33 = 43 \)

So, \( y \geq 43 \)

But \( y + z = 98 - 12 = 86 \)

So, \( y \geq 43 \implies z \leq 86 - 43 = 43 \)

Check if \( y*b + z*c = 43*12 + 43*11 = 516 + 473 = 989 \)

But \( 989 \) compared to \( 1001 - 12 = 989 \)

So, equality holds.

Therefore, with \( b = 12 \), \( c = 11 \), \( x = b - 1 = 11 \), \( y = 43 \), \( z = 43 \), the total value is exactly 989, which is equal to \( 1001 - 12 = 989 \).

Therefore, with \( x = 11 \), \( y = 43 \), \( z = 43 \), we have a total of 97 stamps, and the total value is exactly 989, which is 1001 - 12.

Wait, but we need to cover up to 1000. So, with \( x = 11 \), \( y = 43 \), \( z = 43 \), \( c = 11 \), \( b = 12 \), the total value is 989, but we need to cover up to 1000.

Wait, so 989 is less than 1000, which means we can't cover 1000.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, 43*12 + 43*11 = 516 + 473 = 989. So, that's correct. So, we can only cover up to 989, which is insufficient.

Therefore, \( c = 11 \), \( b = 12 \) is insufficient because the total value is 989, which is less than 1000.

Therefore, to cover up to 1000, we need the total value \( y*b + z*c \geq 1000 - x \).

With \( x = 11 \), \( 1000 - x = 989 \), which is exactly matched by \( y*b + z*c = 989 \). Therefore, we can just barely cover up to 989, but not 1000.

Therefore, to cover up to 1000, we need the total value to be at least 1000 - x = 989, which is exactly achieved here, but 1000 itself requires an extra 1, which we don't have.

Wait, but with \( x = 11 \), we have 11 1s, so we can cover 11 as 1*11, but 1000 is 1000, which is 1*1000, but we don't have a 1000 stamp.

Wait, no, in this case, 1000 is built from \( y*b + z*c \), but we have 43*12 + 43*11 = 989. So, 989 is the maximum we can get, but we need 1000.

Therefore, in this case, we cannot cover 1000.

Wait, so perhaps \( c = 11 \) is not sufficient.

Alternatively, maybe increasing \( c \) allows for a higher total.

Wait, let's try \( c = 12 \), \( b = 13 \).

Then, \( x = b - 1 = 12 \), \( y + z = 98 - 13 = 85 \).

Total value contributed by \( b \) and \( c \): \( y*13 + z*12 \geq 1001 - 13 = 988 \).

With \( y + z = 85 \), let \( z = 85 - y \), then:

\( 13y + 12*(85 - y) \geq 988 \)

= \( 13y + 1020 - 12y \geq 988 \)

= \( y + 1020 \geq 988 \)

= \( y \geq -32 \)

Which is always true since \( y \geq 1 \).

But we need to find the minimal \( y \) such that the total is at least 988.

So, with \( c = 12 \), \( b = 13 \), \( x = 12 \), \( y + z = 85 \), we can have \( y = 1 \), \( z = 84 \):

Total value: \( 13*1 + 12*84 = 13 + 1008 = 1021 \geq 988 \).

So, with \( y = 1 \), \( z = 84 \), we can achieve a total value of 1021, which is above 988.

But then, can we cover all numbers up to 1000?

Wait, with \( x = 12 \), \( y = 1 \), \( z = 84 \), \( b = 13 \), \( c = 12 \).

So, stamps: 12 ones, 1 thirteen, 84 twelves.

Wait, but 12 is the highest denomination here.

Wait, but 13 is higher than 12, so to cover 13, we can use a single 13, but to cover 12, we can use a single 12.

But how do we cover numbers like 14? 14 can be 12 + 1 + 1, but we have 12 1s, so that's manageable.

Similarly, 15 can be 12 + 1 + 1 + 1, and so on.

Wait, but 13 is separate, so 13 is covered by the single 13 stamp.

But wait, to cover 14, we can use one 12 and two 1s, but we only have one 13 stamp and twelve 1s.

Wait, actually, if we have 12 1s, 1 thirteen, and 84 12s.

Wait, but 84 12s is a lot. So, each 12 contributes 12, and we have 84 of them, so we can cover multiples of 12 up to 1008.

But with 12 1s, we can cover up to 12 + ... Hmm, actually, it's a combination.

Wait, maybe the problem is that with such a high number of 12s, the coverage is extensive, but does it miss any numbers?

Wait, let me think. If we have 84 12s, we can cover any multiple of 12 up to 1008, and with 12 1s, we can cover up to 12 more.

So, the combination of 12s and 1s can cover numbers from 1 to 12*84 + 12 = 1008 + 12 = 1020.

But since we have 12 1s, we can cover any number from 1 to 1020, but in our case, we need only up to 1000.

But in our problem, we have to have a collection of 97 stamps, so the number of 12s is 84, which is acceptable.

But wait, let me check whether all numbers up to 1000 can be formed.

Numbers from 1 to 12: Can be formed by 1s and possibly a 12 if needed.

But since we have only one 13 stamp, but 12 is covered by a 12 stamp.

Wait, numbers 1 to 11 can be formed by the 12 1s.

Number 12 can be formed by a single 12.

Number 13 can be formed by a single 13.

Numbers from 14 to 24: 13 + 1, 13 + 2, ..., 13 + 11, and then 12 + 1, 12 + 2, ..., 12 + 12, etc.

Wait, but since we have only one 13, we can only form 13 once, but to form numbers beyond 24, we need multiple 12s.

But 12*2 = 24, so 24 can be formed by two 12s or a 12 and a 12.

Wait, but since we have 84 12s, we can certainly cover up to 1008.

But let's test a number in between, say, 25.

25 can be formed as 12 + 12 + 1, which is two 12s and one 1. Since we have 84 12s and 12 1s, yes, that's possible.

Similarly, 26: 12 + 12 + 2, etc.

Wait, but with only 12 1s, we can cover up to 12 extra after using 12s.

But since we have 84 12s, which can be used to reach high multiples.

Therefore, in this configuration, with \( c = 12 \), \( b = 13 \), \( x = 12 \), \( y = 1 \), \( z = 84 \), we can cover all numbers up to 1000.

Because:

- Numbers 1 to 12: covered by 12 1s.

- Number 13: covered by one 13.

- Numbers 14 to 25: covered by combinations of 12s and 1s.

- Number 26: 12 + 12 + 2, etc.

Wait, actually, with 84 12s, we can cover any number up to 1008, and with 12 1s, we can adjust the remainder.

Therefore, this configuration should work.

But in this case, \( c = 12 \). Is this the smallest possible \( c \)?

Earlier, with \( c = 11 \), we saw that it was insufficient because the total value was 989, which is less than 1000. But wait, actually, in that case, we had 989 as the maximum, but we needed to reach 1000. So, perhaps with \( c = 11 \), but adjusting the number of 1s.

Wait, let's revisit \( c = 11 \).

Suppose \( c = 11 \), \( b = 12 \), \( x = 11 \), \( y + z = 98 - 12 = 86 \).

We need \( y*12 + z*11 \geq 1001 - 12 = 989 \).

So, with \( y + z = 86 \), substitute \( z = 86 - y \):

\( 12y + 11*(86 - y) \geq 989 \)

= \( 12y + 946 - 11y \geq 989 \)

= \( y + 946 \geq 989 \)

= \( y \geq 43 \)

Therefore, \( y \geq 43 \), \( z \leq 43 \).

So, with \( y = 43 \), \( z = 43 \):

Total value: \( 43*12 + 43*11 = 516 + 473 = 989 \), which is exactly 989, which is less than 1000.

Wait, so 1000 is beyond the maximum value.

Wait, but if we have 43 12s and 43 11s, the total is 989, but we need to reach 1000. So, 1000 - 989 = 11, so we need an additional 11 somewhere.

But we only have 43 11s, which we've already used.

Wait, unless we can use multiple 11s.

Wait, no, each stamp can only be used once in a subset.

Therefore, the maximum we can reach is 989, which is less than 1000.

Therefore, \( c = 11 \) is insufficient.

Therefore, the next possible \( c \) is 12.

Wait, but with \( c = 12 \), as above, we can reach 1021, which is sufficient, but let me verify if all numbers up to 1000 can be covered.

Yes, as previously thought, with \( c = 12 \), \( b = 13 \), \( x = 12 \), \( y = 1 \), \( z = 84 \), we can cover all numbers up to 1000.

Therefore, \( c = 12 \) is a candidate.

Is there a smaller \( c \)? Well, \( c = 11 \) didn't work, so the next is 12.

But wait, perhaps \( c = 11 \) with a different \( b \).

Wait, if \( c = 11 \), \( b = 14 \), then \( x = 13 \), \( y + z = 98 - 14 = 84 \).

Total value needed: \( 1001 - 14 = 987 \).

So, \( y*14 + z*11 \geq 987 \).

With \( z = 84 - y \):

\( 14y + 11*(84 - y) \geq 987 \)

= \( 14y + 924 - 11y \geq 987 \)

= \( 3y + 924 \geq 987 \)

= \( 3y \geq 63 \implies y \geq 21 \)

Therefore, \( y = 21 \), \( z = 63 \).

Total value: \( 21*14 + 63*11 = 294 + 693 = 987 \), which is exactly 987.

But the total value is 987, but we need to cover up to 1000.

So, similar to before, 987 is less than 1000, so we cannot cover 1000.

Therefore, \( c = 11 \) is insufficient regardless of \( b \).

Therefore, \( c = 12 \) is the minimal \( c \) that allows \( f(1, b, c) = 97 \).

But wait, is \( c = 12 \) the only possibility, or can \( c \) be higher?

Wait, perhaps for \( c = 13 \), \( b = 14 \), but that would likely result in a higher total value, thus allowing \( x \) to be smaller.

But perhaps the minimal \( c \) is 12.

Wait, but let me check if \( c = 12 \) is indeed the minimal.

From the above analysis, with \( c = 12 \), we can cover up to 1000 with 97 stamps.

But is there another combination with \( c = 12 \), but a different \( b \), which might allow \( f(1, b, c) = 97 \)?

For instance, \( b = 14 \), \( c = 12 \).

Then, \( x = b - 1 = 13 \), \( y + z = 98 - 14 = 84 \).

Total value needed: \( 1001 - 14 = 987 \).

So,

\( y*14 + z*12 \geq 987 \)

With \( z = 84 - y \):

\( 14y + 12*(84 - y) \geq 987 \)

= \( 14y + 1008 - 12y \geq 987 \)

= \( 2y + 1008 \geq 987 \)

= \( 2y \geq -21 \)

Which is always true, so minimal \( y = 1 \), \( z = 83 \).

Total value: \( 14 + 12*83 = 14 + 996 = 1010 \geq 987 \)

Therefore, with \( x = 13 \), \( y = 1 \), \( z = 83 \), \( b = 14 \), \( c = 12 \), we can cover up to 1010, which includes 1000.

But does this configuration allow covering all numbers up to 1000?

Let me think.

Numbers 1 to 12 can be formed by the 13 1s (but wait, we have only 13 1s, so numbers 1 to 13 can be formed, but 12 is covered by a single 12 stamp.

Wait, no, 12 is covered by a 12 stamp.

Wait, but we have only one 12 stamp? No, we have 83 12s.

Wait, \( z = 83 \), so we have 83 12s.

Therefore, numbers 1 to 13: 1s can handle up to 13, 12s can handle up to 12*83 = 1000 - but wait, 12*83 = 996.

Wait, but 12*83 + 1*13 = 996 + 13 = 1009, which is beyond 1000.

But to cover 1 to 1000, how?

Wait, numbers 1 to 12 can be covered by the 1s and 12 stamp.

Wait, no, actually, 12 is covered by a 12 stamp.

But 13 can be formed by a 12 + 1.

14 can be formed by two 12s and two 1s.

Wait, but with 83 12s, we can definitely cover all numbers up to 1000.

Because 12*83 = 996, and adding 1s, we can reach 996 + 13 = 1009.

But we need only up to 1000.

Therefore, yes, all numbers up to 1000 can be formed.

Therefore, with \( c = 12 \), \( b = 14 \), \( x = 13 \), \( y = 1 \), \( z = 83 \), we can cover all numbers up to 1000.

But in this case, the number of 1s is 13, which is more than in the previous case.

But since we're looking for \( f(a, b, c) = 97 \), which is satisfied in both cases, so both configurations are valid.

Therefore, \( c = 12 \) is a possible minimal value.

But let's check \( c = 12 \), \( b = 15 \).

Then, \( x = 14 \), \( y + z = 98 - 15 = 83 \).

Total value needed: \( 1001 - 15 = 986 \).

So,

\( y*15 + z*12 \geq 986 \)

With \( z = 83 - y \):

\( 15y + 12*(83 - y) \geq 986 \)

= \( 15y + 996 - 12y \geq 986 \)

= \( 3y + 996 \geq 986 \)

= \( 3y \geq -10 \)

Always true.

So, minimal \( y = 1 \), \( z = 82 \).

Total value: \( 15 + 12*82 = 15 + 984 = 999 \geq 986 \).

Therefore, with \( x = 14 \), \( y = 1 \), \( z = 82 \), \( b = 15 \), \( c = 12 \), we can cover up to 999 + 15 = 1014, but actually, the maximum value is 15 + 12*82 = 15 + 984 = 999, which is still less than 1000.

Wait, so we need to reach 1000. So, 1000 can be formed as 12*83 + 14, but we don't have a 14 stamp.

Wait, actually, in this configuration, we have 13 1s, 1 15, and 82 12s.

Wait, no, in this case, \( x = 14 \), so 14 1s.

Wait, sorry, correcting:

\( x = b - 1 = 15 - 1 = 14 \)

Therefore, 14 1s, 1 15, and 82 12s.

So, the total value contributed by 12s and 15 is 12*82 + 15*1 = 984 + 15 = 999.

Plus, the 14 1s give 14, so the total is 999 + 14 = 1013.

But to form 1000, can we do 12*83 + 14 = 1008 + 14 = 1022, but we only have 82 12s.

Wait, so to form 1000, we need 12*83 + 14, but we only have 82 12s, so 12*82 = 984. Then, 984 + 14 = 998. To get to 1000, we need two more 1s.

But we have 14 1s, so yes, 984 + 14 + 14 = 1012. But 1000 is in between.

Wait, perhaps another combination: 12*82 + 15 + 14 = 984 + 15 + 14 = 1013.

Wait, but 1000 is less than that.

Wait, perhaps forming 1000 as 12*83 + 14 - 12 = 1008 + 14 - 12 = 1010.

But that seems convoluted.

Wait, maybe 1000 can be formed as 12*83 + 14, but we don't have 83 12s.

We have 82 12s.

So, 12*82 = 984, and 984 + 14 = 998.

To get to 1000, we need two more, so 998 + 2 = 1000.

But we don't have any more 1s beyond the 14 we have.

Wait, but 998 + 14 = 1012, which overshoots.

Wait, so perhaps 1000 cannot be formed in this configuration.

Therefore, this configuration fails to cover 1000.

Therefore, \( c = 12 \), \( b = 15 \) is invalid.

Similarly, \( c = 12 \), \( b = 16 \):

\( x = 15 \), \( y + z = 98 - 16 = 82 \).

Total value needed: \( 1001 - 16 = 985 \).

So,

\( y*16 + z*12 \geq 985 \)

With \( z = 82 - y \):

\( 16y + 12*(82 - y) \geq 985 \)

= \( 16y + 984 - 12y \geq 985 \)

= \( 4y + 984 \geq 985 \)

= \( 4y \geq 1 \implies y \geq 1 \)

So, \( y = 1 \), \( z = 81 \).

Total value: \( 16 + 12*81 = 16 + 972 = 988 \geq 985 \).

But, similar to before, we can't cover 1000 because 12*81 + 15 = 972 + 15 = 987, which is still less than 1000.

Wait, but in this case, we have 15 1s, so 987 + 15 = 987 + 15 = 1002, which is beyond 1000.

Wait, but 1000 can be formed as 12*83 + 14, but we don't have 83 12s.

Wait, alternatively, 12*81 + 16 = 972 + 16 = 988.

Adding the 15 1s: 988 + 15 = 1003.

But 1000 is in between.

Wait, maybe 12*81 + 16 + 15 = 972 + 16 + 15 = 1003.

Still overshooting.

Alternatively, 12*81 + 15*1 = 972 + 15 = 987.

Not enough.

Wait, so 1000 cannot be formed in this configuration.

Therefore, \( c = 12 \), \( b = 16 \) is invalid.

Hence, \( c = 12 \) only works when \( b \) is 13 or 14.

Wait, when \( b = 13 \), \( c = 12 \), \( x = 12 \), \( y = 1 \), \( z = 84 \), the total value is 1021, which allows us to cover up to 1021, so 1000 is covered.

Similarly, with \( b = 14 \), \( c = 12 \), \( x = 13 \), \( y = 1 \), \( z = 83 \), the total value is 1010, which covers 1000.

But in both cases, \( c = 12 \) is achievable.

Therefore, \( c = 12 \) is the minimal \( c \) such that \( f(1, b, c) = 97 \).

Similarly, can we have \( c = 13 \)?

Yes, but \( c = 12 \) is smaller.

Therefore, the minimal \( c \) is 12.

But let's check \( c = 12 \), \( b = 17 \), to see if it's also possible.

Then, \( x = 16 \), \( y + z = 98 - 17 = 81 \).

Total value needed: \( 1001 - 17 = 984 \).

So,

\( y*17 + z*12 \geq 984 \)

With \( z = 81 - y \):

\( 17y + 12*(81 - y) \geq 984 \)

= \( 17y + 972 - 12y \geq 984 \)

= \( 5y + 972 \geq 984 \)

= \( 5y \geq 12 \implies y \geq 3 \)

Therefore, \( y = 3 \), \( z = 78 \).

Total value: \( 17*3 + 12*78 = 51 + 936 = 987 \geq 984 \).

So, with \( x = 16 \), \( y = 3 \), \( z = 78 \), \( b = 17 \), \( c = 12 \), we can cover up to 987 + 16 = 1003, which is sufficient.

But can we cover 1000?

Numbers up to 1003 can be formed with these stamps.

Since 12*78 = 936, plus 17*3 = 51, plus 16 1s = 16.

So, 936 + 51 + 16 = 1003.

Therefore, we can form all numbers up to 1003, hence 1000 is included.

Therefore, \( c = 12 \) is indeed valid for \( b = 17 \).

But since we're looking for the minimal \( c \), which is 12, and \( c = 12 \) is possible, that's the answer.

But wait, actually, according to the problem statement, we have to find the sum of the three smallest possible values of \( c \). So, if \( c = 12 \) is the minimal, then we need to find the next two minimal \( c \) such that \( f(1, b, c) = 97 \), then sum them.

But is \( c = 12 \) the only minimal, or can there be other \( c \) values?

Wait, perhaps \( c = 12 \) is the minimal, and then \( c = 13 \), \( c = 14 \), etc., but the problem asks for the sum of the three smallest \( c \) such that \( f(1, b, c) = 97 \).

Therefore, we need to find all \( c \) where \( c \geq 12 \), such that \( f(1, b, c) = 97 \), and take the three smallest ones.

Wait, but how do we know how many \( c \) satisfy this condition?

It's possible that only \( c = 12 \) is possible, but the problem states "three smallest possible values", implying that there are multiple.

So, perhaps \( c = 12 \), \( c = 13 \), \( c = 14 \), etc., each with different \( b \), but all satisfying \( f(1, b, c) = 97 \).

Therefore, perhaps the minimal three \( c \) are 12, 13, 14, but need to verify.

Wait, let's check \( c = 13 \).

For \( c = 13 \), what's the minimal \( b \)?

We have \( x = b - 1 \), \( y + z = 98 - b \), and \( y*b + z*13 \geq 1001 - b \).

To minimize \( c \), we need the minimal \( c = 13 \).

So, let's try \( c = 13 \), \( b = 14 \).

Then, \( x = 13 \), \( y + z = 98 - 14 = 84 \).

Total value needed: \( 1001 - 14 = 987 \).

So,

\( 14y + 13z \geq 987 \)

With \( z = 84 - y \):

\( 14y + 13*(84 - y) \geq 987 \)

= \( 14y + 1092 - 13y \geq 987 \)

= \( y + 1092 \geq 987 \)

= \( y \geq -105 \), which is always true.

Therefore, minimal \( y = 0 \), \( z = 84 \).

Total value: \( 14*0 + 13*84 = 0 + 1092 = 1092 \geq 987 \).

So, with \( x = 13 \), \( y = 0 \), \( z = 84 \), \( b = 14 \), \( c = 13 \), we can cover all numbers up to 1092, which includes 1000.

Therefore, \( c = 13 \) is possible.

Similarly, \( c = 14 \):

Then, \( x = 15 \), \( y + z = 98 - 15 = 83 \).

Total value needed: \( 1001 - 15 = 986 \).

So,

\( 15y + 14z \geq 986 \)

With \( z = 83 - y \):

\( 15y + 14*(83 - y) \geq 986 \)

= \( 15y + 1162 - 14y \geq 986 \)

= \( y + 1162 \geq 986 \)

= \( y \geq -176 \), which is always true.

Minimal \( y = 0 \), \( z = 83 \).

Total value: \( 15*0 + 14*83 = 0 + 1162 = 1162 \geq 986 \).

Therefore, \( c = 14 \) is also possible.

Therefore, the three smallest \( c \) are 12, 13, 14.

Summing them: 12 + 13 + 14 = 39.

Therefore, the answer is 39.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{39}
</think>

Given positive integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) in ascending order such that the function \(f(a, b, c)\) equals 97, we need to find the sum of the three smallest possible values of \(c\).

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The function \(f(a, b, c)\) is the minimal number of stamps needed to cover every value of \(n\) from 1 upwards.
   - We need to find \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) such that \(f(1, b, c) = 97\).
   - The goal is to find the three smallest values of \(c\) and sum them.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - \(a = 1\) because otherwise, we couldn't cover the number 1.
   - The total number of stamps is 97, so \(1 + y + z = 97\) implies \(y + z = 96\).
   - The total value contributed by \(b\) and \(c\) stamps must be at least 999 to cover all numbers up to 1000.

3. **Calculations for \(c = 12\)**:
   - For \(c = 12\), \(b = 13\), \(x = 12\), \(y + z = 86\).
   - Total value needed: \(989\).
   - With \(y = 43\) and \(z = 43\), the total value is exactly 989, but this was found to be insufficient.
   - Correct configuration: \(x = 12\), \(y = 1\), \(z = 84\) with total value 1021, which is sufficient.

4. **Calculations for \(c = 13\)**:
   - For \(c = 13\), \(b = 14\), \(x = 13\), \(y + z = 84\).
   - Total value needed: \(987\).
   - With \(y = 0\) and \(z = 84\), the total value is 1092, which is sufficient.

5. **Calculations for \(c = 14\)**:
   - For \(c = 14\), \(b = 15\), \(x = 14\), \(y + z = 82\).
   - Total value needed: \(986\).
   - With \(y = 0\) and \(z = 82\), the total value is 1162, which is sufficient.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The three smallest values of \(c\) are 12, 13, and 14.
   - Summing these values gives \(12 + 13 + 14 = 39\).
