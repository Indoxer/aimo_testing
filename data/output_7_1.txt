 The problem: 
Find the three-digit positive integer $\underline{a}\,\underline{b}\,\underline{c}$ whose representation in base nine is $\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\,\underline{a}_{\,\text{nine}},$ where $a,$ $b,$ and $c$ are (not necessarily distinct) digits.


To find the three-digit positive integer \(\underline{a}\,\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\) whose representation in base nine is \(\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\,\underline{a}_{\,\text{nine}}\), we need to translate the given conditions into a mathematical equation.

First, let's express the number \(\underline{a}\,\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\) in decimal form:
\[
\underline{a}\,\underline{b}\,\underline{c} = 100a + 10b + c
\]

Next, let's express the number \(\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\,\underline{a}_{\,\text{nine}}\) in decimal form. Since it is in base nine, we have:
\[
\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\,\underline{a}_{\,\text{nine}} = b \cdot 9^2 + c \cdot 9^1 + a \cdot 9^0 = 81b + 9c + a
\]

According to the problem, these two expressions are equal:
\[
100a + 10b + c = 81b + 9c + a
\]

Now, let's simplify this equation by moving all terms involving \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) to one side:
\[
100a + 10b + c - 81b - 9c - a = 0
\]
\[
99a - 71b - 8c = 0
\]

We can rearrange this equation to solve for one of the variables. Let's solve for \(a\):
\[
99a = 71b + 8c
\]
\[
a = \frac{71b + 8c}{99}
\]

Since \(a\) must be an integer, \(71b + 8c\) must be divisible by 99. We need to find values of \(b\) and \(c\) such that this condition is satisfied. Note that \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are digits (i.e., integers between 0 and 9).

Let's test possible values for \(b\) and \(c\) to find a solution:

1. If \(b = 0\):
   \[
   71(0) + 8c = 8c \quad \text{(not divisible by 99 for any integer } c)
   \]

2. If \(b = 1\):
   \[
   71(1) + 8c = 71 + 8c \quad \text{(not divisible by 99 for any integer } c)
   \]

3. If \(b = 2\):
   \[
   71(2) + 8c = 142 + 8c \quad \text{(not divisible by 99 for any integer } c)
   \]

4. If \(b = 3\):
   \[
   71(3) + 8c = 213 + 8c \quad \text{(not divisible by 99 for any integer } c)
   \]

5. If \(b = 4\):
   \[
   71(4) + 8c = 284 + 8c \quad \text{(not divisible by 99 for any integer } c)
   \]

6. If \(b = 5\):
   \[
   71(5) + 8c = 355 + 8c \quad \text{(not divisible by 99 for any integer } c)
   \]

7. If \(b = 6\):
   \[
   71(6) + 8c = 426 + 8c \quad \text{(not divisible by 99 for any integer } c)
   \]

8. If \(b = 7\):
   \[
   71(7) + 8c = 497 + 8c \quad \text{(not divisible by 99 for any integer } c)
   \]

9. If \(b = 8\):
   \[
   71(8) + 8c = 568 + 8c \quad \text{(not divisible by 99 for any integer } c)
   \]

10. If \(b = 9\):
    \[
    71(9) + 8c = 639 + 8c \quad \text{(not divisible by 99 for any integer } c)
    \]

After testing all possible values for \(b\), we find that there is no integer solution for \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) that satisfies the equation \(99a = 71b + 8c\). Therefore, there is no three-digit positive integer \(\underline{a}\,\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\) whose representation in base nine is \(\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\,\underline{a}_{\,\text{nine}}\).

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{000}
\] (Note: This indicates that no such number exists.) However, if we interpret the problem as finding a number where the conditions are met in a theoretical sense, we should conclude there is no valid solution. Therefore, the correct interpretation of the problem is that no such number exists, and the answer is \(\boxed{000}\).
