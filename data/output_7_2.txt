 The problem: 
Find the three-digit positive integer $\underline{a}\,\underline{b}\,\underline{c}$ whose representation in base nine is $\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\,\underline{a}_{\,\text{nine}},$ where $a,$ $b,$ and $c$ are (not necessarily distinct) digits.


To solve the problem, we need to find a three-digit positive integer \(\underline{a}\,\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\) such that its representation in base nine is \(\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\,\underline{a}_{\,\text{nine}}\). This means that the number \(100a + 10b + c\) in decimal is equal to the number \(81b + 9c + a\) in base nine.

We start by setting up the equation:
\[100a + 10b + c = 81b + 9c + a.\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[100a - a + 10b - 81b + c - 9c = 0,\]
\[99a - 71b - 8c = 0.\]
This simplifies to:
\[99a = 71b + 8c.\]
Since \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are digits (0 through 8 for \(b\) and \(c\) because they are base nine digits, and 0 through 9 for \(a\) but \(a \neq 0\) because it is a three-digit number), we need to find values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) that satisfy this equation.

First, we note that \(99a\) must be divisible by 8. We check the possible values for \(a\) from 1 to 9:
- If \(a = 1\), then \(99 \times 1 = 99\), which is not divisible by 8.
- If \(a = 2\), then \(99 \times 2 = 198\), which is not divisible by 8.
- If \(a = 3\), then \(99 \times 3 = 297\), which is not divisible by 8.
- If \(a = 4\), then \(99 \times 4 = 396\), which is divisible by 8.
- If \(a = 5\), then \(99 \times 5 = 495\), which is not divisible by 8.
- If \(a = 6\), then \(99 \times 6 = 594\), which is not divisible by 8.
- If \(a = 7\), then \(99 \times 7 = 693\), which is not divisible by 8.
- If \(a = 8\), then \(99 \times 8 = 792\), which is divisible by 8.

So, \(a\) can be 4 or 8. We will check both cases.

**Case 1: \(a = 4\).**
\[99 \times 4 = 71b + 8c,\]
\[396 = 71b + 8c.\]
We need to find integer values of \(b\) and \(c\) that satisfy this equation. We start by isolating \(c\):
\[8c = 396 - 71b,\]
\[c = \frac{396 - 71b}{8}.\]
For \(c\) to be an integer, \(396 - 71b\) must be divisible by 8. We check the values of \(b\) from 0 to 8:
- If \(b = 0\), then \(396 - 71 \times 0 = 396\), and \(396 \div 8 = 49.5\) (not an integer).
- If \(b = 1\), then \(396 - 71 \times 1 = 325\), and \(325 \div 8 = 40.625\) (not an integer).
- If \(b = 2\), then \(396 - 71 \times 2 = 254\), and \(254 \div 8 = 31.75\) (not an integer).
- If \(b = 3\), then \(396 - 71 \times 3 = 183\), and \(183 \div 8 = 22.875\) (not an integer).
- If \(b = 4\), then \(396 - 71 \times 4 = 112\), and \(112 \div 8 = 14\) (an integer).
- If \(b = 5\), then \(396 - 71 \times 5 = 41\), and \(41 \div 8 = 5.125\) (not an integer).
- If \(b = 6\), then \(396 - 71 \times 6 = -30\), and \(-30 \div 8 = -3.75\) (not an integer).
- If \(b = 7\), then \(396 - 71 \times 7 = -101\), and \(-101 \div 8 = -12.625\) (not an integer).
- If \(b = 8\), then \(396 - 71 \times 8 = -172\), and \(-172 \div 8 = -21.5\) (not an integer).

So, \(b = 4\) and \(c = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/8 = 14/
