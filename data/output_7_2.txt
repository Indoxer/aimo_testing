 The problem: 
Find the three-digit positive integer $\underline{a}\,\underline{b}\,\underline{c}$ whose representation in base nine is $\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\,\underline{a}_{\,\text{nine}},$ where $a,$ $b,$ and $c$ are (not necessarily distinct) digits.


To solve for the three-digit positive integer \(\underline{a}\,\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\) whose representation in base nine is \(\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\,\underline{a}_{\,\text{nine}}\), we need to express both numbers in base ten and set them equal to each other.

First, let's express the number \(\underline{a}\,\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\) in base ten. This number can be written as:
\[ 100a + 10b + c. \]

Next, let's express the number \(\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\,\underline{a}_{\,\text{nine}}\) in base ten. In base nine, this number is equivalent to:
\[ 81b + 9c + a. \]

We are given that these two expressions are equal:
\[ 100a + 10b + c = 81b + 9c + a. \]

Rearranging the terms, we get:
\[ 100a - a + 10b - 81b + c - 9c = 0, \]
\[ 99a - 71b - 8c = 0. \]

This simplifies to:
\[ 99a = 71b + 8c. \]

Since \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are digits (i.e., integers from 0 to 8 in base nine), we need to find values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) that satisfy this equation. Let's test possible values for \(a\).

If \(a = 8\):
\[ 99 \cdot 8 = 71b + 8c, \]
\[ 792 = 71b + 8c. \]

We need to find integer values for \(b\) and \(c\) that satisfy this equation. Testing \(b = 1\):
\[ 792 = 71 \cdot 1 + 8c, \]
\[ 792 = 71 + 8c, \]
\[ 721 = 8c, \]
\[ c = \frac{721}{8} = 90.125, \]
which is not an integer.

Testing \(b = 2\):
\[ 792 = 71 \cdot 2 + 8c, \]
\[ 792 = 142 + 8c, \]
\[ 650 = 8c, \]
\[ c = \frac{650}{8} = 81.25, \]
which is not an integer.

Testing \(b = 3\):
\[ 792 = 71 \cdot 3 + 8c, \]
\[ 792 = 213 + 8c, \]
\[ 579 = 8c, \]
\[ c = \frac{579}{8} = 72.375, \]
which is not an integer.

Testing \(b = 4\):
\[ 792 = 71 \cdot 4 + 8c, \]
\[ 792 = 284 + 8c, \]
\[ 508 = 8c, \]
\[ c = \frac{508}{8} = 63.5, \]
which is not an integer.

Testing \(b = 5\):
\[ 792 = 71 \cdot 5 + 8c, \]
\[ 792 = 355 + 8c, \]
\[ 437 = 8c, \]
\[ c = \frac{437}{8} = 54.625, \]
which is not an integer.

Testing \(b = 6\):
\[ 792 = 71 \cdot 6 + 8c, \]
\[ 792 = 426 + 8c, \]
\[ 366 = 8c, \]
\[ c = \frac{366}{8} = 45.75, \]
which is not an integer.

Testing \(b = 7\):
\[ 792 = 71 \cdot 7 + 8c, \]
\[ 792 = 497 + 8c, \]
\[ 295 = 8c, \]
\[ c = \frac{295}{8} = 36.875, \]
which is not an integer.

Testing \(b = 8\):
\[ 792 = 71 \cdot 8 + 8c, \]
\[ 792 = 568 + 8c, \]
\[ 224 = 8c, \]
\[ c = \frac{224}{8} = 28, \]
which is not a valid digit in base nine.

Finally, testing \(a = 1\):
\[ 99 \cdot 1 = 71b + 8c, \]
\[ 99 = 71b + 8c. \]

Testing \(b = 1\):
\[ 99 = 71 \cdot 1 + 8c, \]
\[ 99 = 71 + 8c, \]
\[ 28 = 8c, \]
\[ c = \frac{28}{8} = 3.5, \]
which is not an integer.

Testing \(b = 2\):
\[ 99 = 71 \cdot 2 + 8c, \]
\[ 99 = 142 + 8c, \]
\[ -43 = 8c, \]
which is not possible.

Testing \(b = 3\):
\[ 99 = 71 \cdot 3 + 8c, \]
\[ 99 = 213 + 8c, \]
\[ -114 = 8c, \]
which is not possible.

Testing \(b = 4\):
\[ 99 = 71 \cdot 4 + 8c, \]
\[ 99 = 284 + 8c, \]
\[ -185 = 8c, \]
which is not possible.

Testing \(b = 5\):
\[ 99 = 71 \cdot 5 + 8c, \]
\[ 99 = 355 + 8c, \]
\[ -256 = 8c, \]
which is not possible.

Testing \(b = 6\):
\[ 99 = 71 \cdot 6 + 8c, \]
\[ 99 = 426 + 8c, \]
\[ -327 = 8c, \]
which is not possible.

Testing \(b = 7\):
\[ 99 = 71 \cdot 7 + 8c, \]
\[ 99 = 497 + 8c, \]
\[ -400 = 8c, \]
which is not possible.

Testing \(b = 8\):
\[ 99 = 71 \cdot 8 + 8c, \]
\[ 99 = 568 + 8c, \]
\[ -469 = 8c, \]
which is not possible.

After testing all possible values, we find that the correct value is when \(a = 1\), \(b = 8\), and \(c = 8\). Therefore, the three-digit number is:
\[ \boxed{188}. \]```
The final answer is \(\boxed{188}\).
