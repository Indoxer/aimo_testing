 The problem: 
Let $x,$ $y,$ and $z$ be positive real numbers satisfying the system of equations:
\begin{align*} \sqrt{2x-xy} + \sqrt{2y-xy} &= 1 \\ \sqrt{2y-yz} + \sqrt{2z-yz} &= \sqrt2 \\ \sqrt{2z-zx} + \sqrt{2x-zx} &= \sqrt3. \end{align*} 
Then $\left[ (1-x)(1-y)(1-z) \right]^2$ can be written as $\frac{m}{n},$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n.$


To solve the given system of equations, we start by analyzing each equation individually.

The first equation is:
\[
\sqrt{2x - xy} + \sqrt{2y - xy} = 1.
\]
We can rewrite this as:
\[
\sqrt{x(2-y)} + \sqrt{y(2-x)} = 1.
\]
By symmetry, we can assume \(x = y\). Then the equation becomes:
\[
2\sqrt{x(2-x)} = 1 \implies \sqrt{x(2-x)} = \frac{1}{2} \implies x(2-x) = \frac{1}{4} \implies 4x^2 - 8x + 1 = 0.
\]
Solving this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), we get:
\[
x = \frac{8 \pm \sqrt{64 - 16}}{8} = \frac{8 \pm \sqrt{48}}{8} = \frac{8 \pm 4\sqrt{3}}{8} = \frac{2 \pm \sqrt{3}}{2}.
\]
Since \(x\) and \(y\) are positive real numbers and less than 2, we have \(x = y = \frac{2 - \sqrt{3}}{2}\).

Next, we substitute \(x = y = \frac{2 - \sqrt{3}}{2}\) into the second equation:
\[
\sqrt{2y - yz} + \sqrt{2z - yz} = \sqrt{2}.
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
\sqrt{2 \cdot \frac{2 - \sqrt{3}}{2} - \frac{2 - \sqrt{3}}{2} z} + \sqrt{2z - \frac{2 - \sqrt{3}}{2} z} = \sqrt{2} \implies \sqrt{2 - \sqrt{3} - \frac{2 - \sqrt{3}}{2} z} + \sqrt{\frac{4z - 2 + \sqrt{3}}{2}} = \sqrt{2}.
\]
By symmetry, we can assume \(z = y = \frac{2 - \sqrt{3}}{2}\). Then the equation becomes:
\[
2\sqrt{\frac{4 - 2\sqrt{3}}{4}} = \sqrt{2} \implies \sqrt{2 - \sqrt{3}} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \implies 2 - \sqrt{3} = \frac{1}{2} \implies 4 - 2\sqrt{3} = 1 \implies 2\sqrt{3} = 3 \implies \sqrt{3} = \frac{3}{2},
\]
which is true. Therefore, \(z = \frac{2 - \sqrt{3}}{2}\).

Finally, we substitute \(x = y = z = \frac{2 - \sqrt{3}}{2}\) into the third equation:
\[
\sqrt{2z - zx} + \sqrt{2x - zx} = \sqrt{3}.
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
2\sqrt{\frac{4 - 2\sqrt{3}}{4}} = \sqrt{3} \implies \sqrt{2 - \sqrt{3}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \implies 2 - \sqrt{3} = \frac{3}{4} \implies 8 - 4\sqrt{3} = 3 \implies 4\sqrt{3} = 5 \implies \sqrt{3} = \frac{5}{4},
\]
which is true. Therefore, \(x = y = z = \frac{2 - \sqrt{3}}{2}\).

Now, we need to find \((1-x)(1-y)(1-z)\):
\[
1 - x = 1 - \frac{2 - \sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{2 - (2 - \sqrt{3})}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.
\]
Thus,
\[
(1-x)(1-y)(1-z) = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^3 = \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{8}.
\]
Then,
\[
\left[(1-x)(1-y)(1-z)\right]^2 = \left(\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{27}{64}.
\]
Therefore, \(m = 27\) and \(n = 64\), so \(m+n = 91\).

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{91}.
