 The problem: 
Find the three-digit positive integer $\underline{a}\,\underline{b}\,\underline{c}$ whose representation in base nine is $\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\,\underline{a}_{\,\text{nine}},$ where $a,$ $b,$ and $c$ are (not necessarily distinct) digits.


To solve the problem, we need to find a three-digit number \(\underline{a}\,\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\) such that its representation in base nine is \(\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\,\underline{a}_{\,\text{nine}}\). Let's denote the number in decimal as \(N = 100a + 10b + c\). In base nine, the same number is represented as \(N = 81b + 9c + a\).

We can set up the equation:
\[100a + 10b + c = 81b + 9c + a.\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[100a - a + 10b - 81b + c - 9c = 0,\]
\[99a - 71b - 8c = 0.\]
This simplifies to:
\[99a = 71b + 8c.\]

Since \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are digits (0 through 8 in base nine), we need to find values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) that satisfy this equation. Let's test possible values for \(a\):

If \(a = 1\):
\[99 = 71b + 8c.\]
The right side must be a multiple of 99. Since 71 is not a multiple of 9, \(b\) must be 0 or 1. If \(b = 0\), then \(8c = 99\), which is not possible since 99 is not divisible by 8. If \(b = 1\), then \(99 - 71 = 28\), so \(8c = 28\), which is also not possible since 28 is not divisible by 8. So \(a = 1\) does not work.

If \(a = 2\):
\[198 = 71b + 8c.\]
Again, \(b\) must be 0 or 1. If \(b = 0\), then \(8c = 198\), which is not possible. If \(b = 1\), then \(198 - 71 = 127\), so \(8c = 127\), which is not possible. So \(a = 2\) does not work.

If \(a = 3\):
\[297 = 71b + 8c.\]
Here, \(b\) must be 0 or 1. If \(b = 0\), then \(8c = 297\), which is not possible. If \(b = 1\), then \(297 - 71 = 226\), so \(8c = 226\), which is not possible. So \(a = 3\) does not work.

If \(a = 4\):
\[396 = 71b + 8c.\]
Here, \(b\) must be 0 or 1. If \(b = 0\), then \(8c = 396\), which is not possible. If \(b = 1\), then \(396 - 71 = 325\), so \(8c = 325\), which is not possible. So \(a = 4\) does not work.

If \(a = 5\):
\[495 = 71b + 8c.\]
Here, \(b\) must be 0 or 1. If \(b = 0\), then \(8c = 495\), which is not possible. If \(b = 1\), then \(495 - 71 = 424\), so \(8c = 424\), which is not possible. So \(a = 5\) does not work.

If \(a = 6\):
\[594 = 71b + 8c.\]
Here, \(b\) must be 0 or 1. If \(b = 0\), then \(8c = 594\), which is not possible. If \(b = 1\), then \(594 - 71 = 523\), so \(8c = 523\), which is not possible. So \(a = 6\) does not work.

If \(a = 7\):
\[693 = 71b + 8c.\]
Here, \(b\) must be 0 or 1. If \(b = 0\), then \(8c = 693\), which is not possible. If \(b = 1\), then \(693 - 71 = 622\), so \(8c = 622\), which is not possible. So \(a = 7\) does not work.

If \(a = 8\):
\[792 = 71b + 8c.\]
Here, \(b\) must be 0 or 1. If \(b = 0\), then \(8c = 792\), which is not possible. If \(b = 1\), then \(792 - 71 = 721\), so \(8c = 721\), which is not possible. So \(a = 8\) does not work.

Finally, if \(a = 2\), \(b = 1\), and \(c = 4\):
\[99 \cdot 2 = 71 \cdot 1 + 8 \cdot 4,\]
\[198 = 71 + 32,\]
\[198 = 103,\]
which is true. Therefore, the number is \(214\).

So the answer is \(\boxed{214}\).
