 The problem: 
Let $w = \dfrac{\sqrt{3} + i}{2}$ and $z = \dfrac{-1 + i\sqrt{3}}{2},$ where $i = \sqrt{-1}.$ Find the number of ordered pairs $(r,s)$ of positive integers not exceeding $100$ that satisfy the equation $i \cdot w^r = z^s.$


To solve the problem, we first need to express \(w\) and \(z\) in polar form. Notice that \(w\) and \(z\) are complex numbers that can be written in terms of their magnitudes and arguments.

The magnitude of \(w\) is:
\[
|w| = \left| \frac{\sqrt{3} + i}{2} \right| = \frac{\sqrt{(\sqrt{3})^2 + 1^2}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3 + 1}}{2} = \frac{2}{2} = 1.
\]
The argument of \(w\) is:
\[
\arg(w) = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\right) = \frac{\pi}{6}.
\]
Thus, we can write \(w\) as:
\[
w = e^{i\pi/6}.
\]

Similarly, the magnitude of \(z\) is:
\[
|z| = \left| \frac{-1 + i\sqrt{3}}{2} \right| = \frac{\sqrt{(-1)^2 + (\sqrt{3})^2}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{1 + 3}}{2} = \frac{2}{2} = 1.
\]
The argument of \(z\) is:
\[
\arg(z) = \pi - \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{1}\right) = \pi - \frac{\pi}{3} = \frac{2\pi}{3}.
\]
Thus, we can write \(z\) as:
\[
z = e^{i2\pi/3}.
\]

We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((r, s)\) of positive integers not exceeding 100 that satisfy the equation \(i \cdot w^r = z^s\). First, we express \(i\) in polar form:
\[
i = e^{i\pi/2}.
\]
So the equation becomes:
\[
e^{i\pi/2} \cdot e^{ir\pi/6} = e^{is2\pi/3}.
\]
Combining the exponents on the left side, we get:
\[
e^{i(\pi/2 + r\pi/6)} = e^{is2\pi/3}.
\]
This implies:
\[
\frac{\pi}{2} + \frac{r\pi}{6} = \frac{2s\pi}{3} + 2k\pi \quad \text{for some integer } k.
\]
Dividing through by \(\pi\), we get:
\[
\frac{1}{2} + \frac{r}{6} = \frac{2s}{3} + 2k.
\]
Multiplying through by 6, we get:
\[
3 + r = 4s + 12k.
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
r = 4s + 12k - 3.
\]
Since \(r\) and \(s\) are positive integers not exceeding 100, we need to find the range of \(s\) such that \(r\) is also a positive integer not exceeding 100. This means:
\[
1 \leq 4s + 12k - 3 \leq 100.
\]
Adding 3 to all parts of the inequality, we get:
\[
4 \leq 4s + 12k \leq 103.
\]
Dividing through by 4, we get:
\[
1 \leq s + 3k \leq 25.75.
\]
Since \(s\) and \(k\) are integers, we have:
\[
1 \leq s + 3k \leq 25.
\]
For each integer value of \(s\) from 1 to 25, \(k\) can take any integer value such that \(s + 3k\) is an integer between 1 and 25. The number of possible values for \(k\) is the number of integers in the interval \(\left[\frac{1-s}{3}, \frac{25-s}{3}\right]\). Since \(s\) ranges from 1 to 25, the number of possible values for \(k\) is always 8 (from \(-\infty\) to \(\infty\) within the bounds).

Therefore, there are 25 possible values for \(s\) and for each \(s\), there are 8 possible values for \(k\), giving us a total of:
\[
25 \times 8 = 200
\]
ordered pairs \((r, s)\).

Thus, the number of ordered pairs \((r, s)\) is:
\[
\boxed{200}.
