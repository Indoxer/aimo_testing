 The problem: 
Given $\triangle ABC$ and a point $P$ on one of its sides, call line $\ell$ the $\textit{splitting line}$ of $\triangle ABC$ through $P$ if $\ell$ passes through $P$ and divides $\triangle ABC$ into two polygons of equal perimeter. Let $\triangle ABC$ be a triangle where $BC = 219$ and $AB$ and $AC$ are positive integers. Let $M$ and $N$ be the midpoints of $\overline{AB}$ and $\overline{AC},$ respectively, and suppose that the splitting lines of $\triangle ABC$ through $M$ and $N$ intersect at $30^\circ.$ Find the perimeter of $\triangle ABC.$


To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the given conditions and using geometric properties. We know that \(M\) and \(N\) are the midpoints of \(AB\) and \(AC\) respectively, and the splitting lines of \(\triangle ABC\) through \(M\) and \(N\) intersect at \(30^\circ\).

First, let's denote the side lengths of \(\triangle ABC\) as follows:
- \(BC = a = 219\)
- \(AB = c\)
- \(AC = b\)

Since \(M\) and \(N\) are midpoints, we have:
- \(AM = \frac{c}{2}\)
- \(AN = \frac{b}{2}\)

The splitting line through \(M\) divides \(\triangle ABC\) into two polygons of equal perimeter. Similarly, the splitting line through \(N\) also divides \(\triangle ABC\) into two polygons of equal perimeter.

Next, we use the fact that the splitting lines through \(M\) and \(N\) intersect at \(30^\circ\). This intersection point is known as the centroid of the triangle, which is the point where the medians intersect. However, since the medians do not necessarily intersect at \(30^\circ\), we need to consider the properties of the triangle more carefully.

Given that the splitting lines through \(M\) and \(N\) intersect at \(30^\circ\), we can use the fact that the centroid divides each median in a 2:1 ratio. Therefore, the intersection point of the medians (the centroid) is not directly relevant here.

Instead, we use the fact that the splitting lines through \(M\) and \(N\) intersect at \(30^\circ\) to infer that the triangle must have specific properties. One such property is that the triangle is equilateral. This is because in an equilateral triangle, the medians, altitudes, and angle bisectors coincide, and the intersection of any two of these lines forms a \(30^\circ\) angle.

However, we need to verify this. Let's assume \(\triangle ABC\) is equilateral. Then:
- \(AB = AC = BC = 219\)

In an equilateral triangle, all sides are equal, and all angles are \(60^\circ\). Therefore, the splitting lines through \(M\) and \(N\) would indeed intersect at \(30^\circ\) because the medians of an equilateral triangle intersect at \(60^\circ\), and the angle between any two medians is \(30^\circ\).

Thus, the perimeter of \(\triangle ABC\) is:
\[
a + b + c = 219 + 219 + 219 = 657
\]

Therefore, the perimeter of \(\triangle ABC\) is:
\[
\boxed{657}
\]
