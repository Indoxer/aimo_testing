 The problem: 
Let $w = \dfrac{\sqrt{3} + i}{2}$ and $z = \dfrac{-1 + i\sqrt{3}}{2},$ where $i = \sqrt{-1}.$ Find the number of ordered pairs $(r,s)$ of positive integers not exceeding $100$ that satisfy the equation $i \cdot w^r = z^s.$


Alright, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of ordered pairs (r, s) of positive integers not exceeding 100 that satisfy the equation i * w^r = z^s. Both w and z are given complex numbers.

First, let me write down what w and z are:

w = (√3 + i)/2

z = (-1 + i√3)/2

And we have i as √(-1). So, all right.

Hmm, these look familiar. They seem like roots of unity or something similar because they have modulus 1 and can be expressed in exponential form using Euler's formula.

Let me check their moduli. The modulus of a complex number a + ib is sqrt(a² + b²).

Calculating |w|:

|w| = sqrt[(√3/2)^2 + (1/2)^2] = sqrt[(3/4) + (1/4)] = sqrt[1] = 1.

Similarly for |z|:

|z| = sqrt[(-1/2)^2 + (√3/2)^2] = sqrt[(1/4) + (3/4)] = sqrt[1] = 1.

So both w and z lie on the unit circle. That means they can be represented in polar form as e^(iθ), where θ is the argument (angle) they make with the positive real axis.

Let me figure out the arguments for w and z.

Starting with w:

w = (√3 + i)/2. Let's denote this as a + ib, where a = √3/2 and b = 1/2.

The argument θ_w is arctan(b/a) = arctan( (1/2)/(√3/2) ) = arctan(1/√3) = π/6 radians or 30 degrees.

Therefore, w can be written as e^(iπ/6).

Now for z:

z = (-1 + i√3)/2. Again, writing as c + id, c = -1/2, d = √3/2.

Argument θ_z is arctan(d/c) but since it's in the second quadrant, we have to add π to the principal value.

So arctan( (√3/2)/(-1/2) ) = arctan(-√3). Since it's negative, arctan(-√3) is -π/3, but since it's in the second quadrant, the angle is π - π/3 = 2π/3 radians or 120 degrees.

Thus, z can be written as e^(i2π/3).

Great, now our equation becomes:

i * w^r = z^s

Expressing everything in exponential form:

i is e^(iπ/2), since its argument is π/2.

w^r is [e^(iπ/6)]^r = e^(iπr/6)

z^s is [e^(i2π/3)]^s = e^(i2πs/3)

Putting it all together:

Left side: i * w^r = e^(iπ/2) * e^(iπr/6) = e^(i(π/2 + πr/6)) = e^(iπ(3 + r)/6)

Right side: z^s = e^(i2πs/3)

For two complex exponentials to be equal, their exponents must differ by an integer multiple of 2π. So,

π(3 + r)/6 ≡ 2πs/3 mod 2π

We can divide both sides by π:

(3 + r)/6 ≡ 2s/3 mod 2

Multiply both sides by 6 to eliminate denominators:

3 + r ≡ 4s mod 12

So, 3 + r ≡ 4s mod 12

Which simplifies to:

r ≡ 4s - 3 mod 12

Or:

r ≡ (4s - 3) mod 12

But since r and s are positive integers not exceeding 100, we need to find all such (r, s) where 1 ≤ r, s ≤ 100 satisfying r ≡ 4s - 3 mod 12.

Alternatively, we can think of r = (4s - 3) + 12k, where k is an integer.

But since r has to be at least 1 and at most 100, we can find the possible values of s such that when you compute r, it falls into the range [1, 100].

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to express s in terms of r or vice versa.

Wait, maybe another approach is better. Let's see:

From the congruence:

r ≡ 4s - 3 mod 12

This implies that for each s, r is determined modulo 12. So for each s, there is exactly one residue class mod 12 for r that satisfies the equation. Therefore, for each s, how many rs satisfy this? Well, since r is between 1 and 100, for each s, we can find the number of r in that range congruent to (4s - 3) mod 12.

But actually, since r is uniquely determined mod 12 by s, for each s, there will be either floor(100 / 12) or floor(100 / 12) + 1 values of r in 1 to 100 satisfying the congruence.

Specifically, 100 divided by 12 is approximately 8.333..., so there are 8 full cycles of 12 in 100, which gives 8*12=96. Then the remaining 4 numbers are 97, 98, 99, 100.

Therefore, for each s, the number of rs is either 8 or 9, depending on whether (4s - 3) mod 12 is among the first 4 residues or not.

Wait, no, actually, more accurately, for each s, regardless of its value, there are either ⌊100 /12⌋ or ⌈100 /12⌉ solutions for r.

But 100 divided by 12 is 8 with remainder 4, so for each s, the number of rs is 8 if (4s - 3) mod 12 is less than or equal to 4, otherwise 9?

Wait, no, maybe not exactly.

Actually, the number of integers r in [1, N] congruent to a mod m is floor((N - a)/m) + 1, provided a <= N.

Wait, let's recall that formula.

Given the number of integers ≤N and ≡a mod m is floor((N - a)/m) + 1, provided a ≠ 0.

In our case, m=12, a=(4s - 3) mod 12.

So, for each s, compute a = (4s - 3) mod 12, then the number of rs is floor((100 - a)/12) + 1.

Since a can be from 0 to 11, but since 4s - 3 can be any integer, mod 12 it wraps around.

But wait, (4s - 3) mod 12 can take any value from 0 to 11 depending on s.

But s ranges from 1 to 100, so 4s - 3 mod 12 can be calculated for each s.

But perhaps instead of thinking about each s, maybe it's better to rephrase the equation.

We had earlier:

3 + r ≡ 4s mod 12

So, 4s ≡ r + 3 mod 12

So, for each r, s must satisfy 4s ≡ (r + 3) mod 12.

So, s ≡ (r + 3)/4 mod 3.

Wait, hold on, 4s ≡ (r + 3) mod 12.

We can divide both sides by 4, but division in modular arithmetic requires that 4 and 12 are coprime, which they aren't. So, rather, we can solve for s.

4s ≡ (r + 3) mod 12.

Divide both sides by gcd(4,12)=4:

s ≡ (r + 3)/4 mod 3.

Therefore, for this congruence to have solutions, (r + 3) must be divisible by 4.

So, (r + 3) ≡ 0 mod 4.

Hence, r ≡ 1 mod 4.

So, r must be congruent to 1 modulo 4.

Therefore, r can be 1,5,9,... up to 97.

So, total number of such r is floor((97 -1)/4) +1= floor(96/4)+1=24+1=25.

Wait, but r goes up to 100, so after 97 comes 101, which is beyond. So, r can be 1,5,9,...,97. How many terms?

It's an arithmetic progression starting at 1, difference 4, last term 97.

Number of terms: ((97 -1)/4)+1= (96/4)+1=24+1=25. So, 25 values of r.

Therefore, only those r that are 1 mod 4 will have s existent in positive integers solving the equation.

So, for each such r, how many s satisfy the equation?

Given that r ≡1 mod4, meaning r=4k +1 for some integer k ≥0.

Then, plugging back into 4s ≡ r +3 mod12:

4s ≡ (4k +1 +3) mod12 => 4s ≡4k +4 mod12 => Divide both sides by 4: s ≡k +1 mod3.

Thus, s ≡k +1 mod3.

So, s can be written as s=3m + (k +1) for m≥0.

But s also needs to be positive and ≤100.

So, for each r=4k +1, s=3m + (k +1) must satisfy 1 ≤s ≤100.

So, m must be chosen such that 3m + (k +1) ≤100.

Thus, m ≤(100 - (k +1))/3.

But k is related to r via r=4k +1. Since r≤100, 4k +1 ≤100 ⇒4k ≤99⇒k≤24.75, so k≤24.

So, k ranges from 0 to24, giving r=1,5,...,97.

For each k, s=3m + (k +1). We need s≥1:

3m + (k +1)≥1. Since k≥0, k +1≥1, and m≥0, this holds.

Also, s≤100:

3m + (k +1) ≤100 ⇒3m ≤99 -k ⇒m ≤(99 -k)/3=33 - (k)/3.

Since m must be integer, m≤floor(33 - k/3).

But k varies from 0 to24, so let's consider different ranges of k.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute for each k from0 to24, the maximum m:

m_max = floor((100 - s)/3), where s=3m + (k +1).

Wait, maybe another way.

Alternatively, for each fixed k, s can be:

s= (k +1), (k +1)+3, (k +1)+6,..., up to ≤100.

So, the number of s per k is floor[(100 - (k +1))/3] +1.

So, for each k, number of s is:

floor[(99 -k)/3] +1.

But since (99 -k) may or may not be divisible by3.

Wait, perhaps better to note that:

Given that s must satisfy s≡k +1 mod3, the number of s from1 to100 is equal to the number of integers in [1,100] congruent to (k +1) mod3.

Which is equal to floor((100 - (k +1))/3) +1, provided (k +1) ≤100.

But since (k +1) is at most25 (since k≤24), so certainly (k +1) ≤100.

Therefore, number of s for each k is floor((100 - (k +1))/3) +1.

Compute that:

floor((99 -k)/3) +1.

Which is equal to floor(33 - k/3) +1.

But wait, floor((99 -k)/3)=33 - ceil(k/3). Wait, not necessarily.

Wait, 99 divided by3 is33, so (99 -k)/3=33 -k/3.

But since k is an integer, k/3 may be integer or fractional.

But floor(33 -k/3)=33 -ceil(k/3).

Wait, let's test:

If k=0: floor(99/3)=33, so 33 +1=34.

Wait, but when k=0, s starts at1, and increments by3: s=1,4,7,...,100.

Number of terms: ((100 -1)/3)+1=33 +1=34.

Similarly, if k=1: floor((99 -1)/3)=floor(98/3)=32. 32 +1=33.

s would start at2,5,8,...,98.

Number of terms: ((98 -2)/3)+1=(96/3)+1=32 +1=33.

Similarly, for k=2: floor((99 -2)/3)=floor(97/3)=32. 32 +1=33.

s starts at3,6,9,...,99.

Number of terms: ((99 -3)/3)+1=(96/3)+1=32 +1=33.

Similarly, for k=3: floor((99 -3)/3)=floor(96/3)=32. 32 +1=33.

s starts at4,7,10,...,100.

Number of terms: ((100 -4)/3)+1=(96/3)+1=32 +1=33.

Wait, hmm, so seems like for k=0, we get34 terms, and for k=1,2,3,...,24, each k gives33 terms.

Wait, let's check k=24:

k=24: floor((99 -24)/3)=floor(75/3)=25. 25 +1=26.

s starts at25,28,..., up to≤100.

Wait, let's see:

s=25,28,31,..., let's compute the maximum s.

s=25 +3m ≤100 ⇒3m ≤75 ⇒m ≤25.

Thus, number of terms is26.

Wait, but according to previous formula, floor(75/3)=25; 25 +1=26. Correct.

So, summarizing:

When k=0:34 s's

When k=1 tok=24:33 s's each.

Thus, total number of ordered pairs is34 +24*33.

Compute that:

24*33=792

34 +792=826.

Wait, but hold on. Are we sure that for k=1 tok=24, each has33 s's? But when k increases beyond certain points, does the number of s's decrease?

Wait, let me test k=25.

Wait, no, k only goes up to24 because r=4k +1 must be ≤100. So k=0 tok=24.

But when k=24:

s starts at25, steps by3, ends at79 (25 +24*3=25 +72=97). Next would be100, which is s=25 +25*3=100.

Wait, s=25,28,...,100.

Number of terms: From25 to100 inclusive, step3.

Number of terms=((100 -25)/3)+1=(75/3)+1=25 +1=26.

Which matches the earlier count.

But for k=0:

s starts at1, step3, up to100.

Number of terms=((100 -1)/3)+1=33 +1=34.

Similarly, for k=1:

s starts at2, step3, up to98.

Number of terms=((98 -2)/3)+1=96/3 +1=32 +1=33.

Same for k=2,3,...,24.

So, indeed, for k=0, 34 s's; for k=1 tok=24, 33 each.

Total ordered pairs:34 +24*33=34 +792=826.

Wait, but let me verify for k=24:

s=25 +3m ≤100. So m can be0 tom=25, which is26 terms.

Similarly, for k=0:

s=1 +3m ≤100: m=0 tom=33, which is34 terms.

For k=1:

s=2 +3m ≤100: m=0 tom=32, which is33 terms.

Yes, correct.

But hang on, the problem says "positive integers not exceeding 100". So, s and r are from1 to100 inclusive.

But when k=24, s=25 +3m, m=0 to25. So s=25,28,...,100, which is26 terms.

Similarly, for k=24, r=4*24 +1=97.

So, s=25,28,...,100, which is26 terms.

Wait, so 26 terms for k=24.

But earlier reasoning said that for k=1 tok=24, each gives33 s's. But k=24 actually gives26.

Wait, so my mistake was assuming all k=1 tok=24 give33 s's, but actually, when k approaches higher values, the number of s's decreases as the upper limit approaches100.

Wait, so perhaps we need a more accurate computation.

Wait, let's define for each k from0 to24:

Number of s's is floor((100 - (k +1))/3) +1.

So, for k=0:

floor(99/3) +1=33 +1=34.

k=1:

floor(98/3)=32.666...→32; 32 +1=33.

k=2:

floor(97/3)=32.333...→32; 32 +1=33.

k=3:

floor(96/3)=32; 32 +1=33.

...

k=24:

floor((100 -25)/3)=floor(75/3)=25; 25 +1=26.

Therefore, for k=0:34

for k=1 tok=23: each k gives33

for k=24:26.

Wait, let's calculate the exact counts:

Number of s's for each k:

k=0:34

k=1: floor(98/3)=32 →32 +1=33

k=2: floor(97/3)=32→32 +1=33

k=3: floor(96/3)=32→32 +1=33

...

Continuing until k=23:

At k=23: floor((100 -24)/3)=floor(76/3)=25.333→25;25 +1=26? Wait, no.

Wait, hold on. For k=23:

s = (23 +1) +3m=24 +3m.

Maximum s=24 +3m ≤100 ⇒3m ≤76 ⇒m ≤25.333⇒m=0 tom=25. Number of terms=26.

Wait, same as k=24.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation.

Wait, for k=23:

s=24 +3m ≤100.

So, m_max= floor((100 -24)/3)=floor(76/3)=25.

So, number of s=25 +1=26.

Similarly, for k=22:

s=23 +3m.

Max s=23 +3m ≤100 ⇒3m ≤77 ⇒m ≤25.666⇒m=0 tom=25.

Number of s=26.

Wait, so perhaps for k=0:34; for k=1 tok=24:each k gives26.

Wait, no, for k=1:

s=2 +3m.

max s=2 +3m ≤100 ⇒3m ≤98 ⇒m ≤32.666⇒m=0 tom=32.

Number of s=33.

Wait, so it's inconsistent.

I think the confusion arises because for lower k, s starts closer to1, allowing more terms, whereas for higher k, s starts further away, reducing the number of terms.

Wait, maybe it's better to split into cases:

Case1: k=0

s=1 +3m, m=0 tom=33 (since1 +3*33=100). So,34 terms.

Case2: k=1 tok=24

Here, s starts atk +1, which is2 tok +1=25.

For each k, s= (k +1) +3m.

The maximum m such that (k +1) +3m ≤100 is m_max= floor((99 -k)/3).

Thus, number of s's= floor((99 -k)/3) +1.

So, for each k=1 tok=24:

number of s's= floor((99 -k)/3) +1.

Compute for k=1: floor(98/3)=32; 32 +1=33

k=2: floor(97/3)=32;32 +1=33

...

k=24:floor(75/3)=25;25 +1=26

Wait, so when k=24:26 s's.

But k=24 is still part of Case2.

So, in total:

Case1:34 s's

Case2: for k=1 tok=24: each k gives varying numbers of s's, from33 downto26.

Wait, so let's compute sum over k=1 tok=24 of number of s's.

Which is sum_{k=1}^{24} [floor((99 -k)/3) +1]

Let’s compute this:

sum_{k=1}^{24} [floor((99 -k)/3) +1] = sum_{k=1}^{24} floor((99 -k)/3) +24

Compute each term:

For k=1: floor(98/3)=32

k=2:floor(97/3)=32

k=3:floor(96/3)=32

k=4:floor(95/3)=31

k=5:floor(94/3)=31

k=6:floor(93/3)=31

k=7:floor(92/3)=30

k=8:floor(91/3)=30

k=9:floor(90/3)=30

k=10:floor(89/3)=29

k=11:floor(88/3)=29

k=12:floor(87/3)=29

k=13:floor(86/3)=28

k=14:floor(85/3)=28

k=15:floor(84/3)=28

k=16:floor(83/3)=27

k=17:floor(82/3)=27

k=18:floor(81/3)=27

k=19:floor(80/3)=26

k=20:floor(79/3)=26

k=21:floor(78/3)=26

k=22:floor(77/3)=25

k=23:floor(76/3)=25

k=24:floor(75/3)=25

So, grouping them:

- For k=1,2,3:32 each→3 terms

Sum:32*3=96

- For k=4,5,6:31 each→3 terms

Sum:31*3=93

- For k=7,8,9:30 each→3 terms

Sum:30*3=90

- For k=10,11,12:29 each→3 terms

Sum:29*3=87

- For k=13,14,15:28 each→3 terms

Sum:28*3=84

- For k=16,17,18:27 each→3 terms

Sum:27*3=81

- For k=19,20,21:26 each→3 terms

Sum:26*3=78

- For k=22,23,24:25 each→3 terms

Sum:25*3=75

Wait, but from k=1 to24, that's24 terms.

Grouped as above: Each group has3 terms, except the last group which has3 terms as well.

So, adding up all the sums:

96 +93 +90 +87 +84 +81 +78 +75.

Compute:

96 +93=189

189 +90=279

279 +87=366

366 +84=450

450 +81=531

531 +78=609

609 +75=684.

Thus, sum_{k=1}^{24} floor((99 -k)/3)=684.

Therefore, sum_{k=1}^{24}[floor((99 -k)/3) +1]=684 +24=708.

Adding Case1:34, total ordered pairs=708 +34=742.

Wait, but previously I thought it was826, but after correcting the counting, it's742.

Wait, let me confirm:

Case1:34

Case2:708

Total:34 +708=742.

But let me double-check the grouping:

From k=1 to24:

Each set of3 k's contributes a certain amount.

As above:

32*3=96

31*3=93

30*3=90

29*3=87

28*3=84

27*3=81

26*3=78

25*3=75

Adding these gives96+93=189;189+90=279;279+87=366;366+84=450;450+81=531;531+78=609;609+75=684.

Then, adding24 for the "+1" in each term, 684 +24=708.

Then, Case1 adds34, total742.

Hmm, so why did I initially get826? Because I assumed all k=1 tok=24 gave33 s's, but in reality, as k increases, the number of s's decreases.

Thus, the correct total should be742.

Wait, but perhaps I missed something else.

Alternatively, let's model the problem differently.

We have r and s ranging from1 to100.

We found that r must be1 mod4, which gives25 values of r.

For each such r, s must satisfy s≡(r +3) mod12.

Since r=4k +1, then s≡(4k +4) mod12⇒s≡4(k +1) mod12.

Which can be rewritten as s≡0,4,8 mod12 depending on k.

Wait, no, since k can vary.

Wait, s must be≡4(k +1) mod12.

Which depends on k.

Alternatively, since s≡(r +3)/4 mod3, as before.

But maybe instead of counting for each r, count for each s.

Perhaps that might be easier.

Given that i * w^r = z^s.

Expressed as e^(iπ/2) * e^(iπr/6) = e^(i2πs/3)

Which is e^(i(π/2 + πr/6)) = e^(i2πs/3)

So, equate the exponents modulo2π:

π/2 + πr/6 ≡2πs/3 mod2π

Divide both sides byπ:

1/2 + r/6 ≡2s/3 mod2

Multiply both sides by6:

3 + r ≡4s mod12

Which brings us back to the original congruence:

r ≡4s -3 mod12.

So, for each s, r must be≡4s -3 mod12.

But r is between1 and100, so for each s, check if4s -3 mod12 is a valid residue for r, i.e.,0 to11.

But r must be at least1, so4s -3 mod12 must be≥0, but since mod12, it wraps around.

Wait, more precisely, for each s, compute t=4s -3 mod12.

If t=0, set t=12.

Then, r=12k +t.

But since r≤100, k is from0 up to floor((100 -t)/12).

Wait, but this seems similar to the prior approach.

Alternatively, for each s from1 to100, compute t=4s -3 mod12.

If t=0, set t=12.

Then, r= t, t +12, t +24,... up to ≤100.

Number of r's per s is floor((100 -t)/12) +1.

So, for each s, compute t=4s -3 mod12.

Then, number of r's is floor((100 -t)/12) +1.

But computing this for all s from1 to100 would take time, but perhaps we can find a pattern.

Note that t=4s -3 mod12.

So, t can be from1 to12.

Because if t=0, we set t=12.

So, for each s, t cycles through1 to12 as s increases.

So, the number of times each t occurs is roughly100/12≈8.333.

But s runs from1 to100, so t=4s -3 mod12.

Compute t for s=1 to12:

s=1:4*1 -3=1 mod12→1

s=2:8 -3=5

s=3:12 -3=9

s=4:16 -3=13≡1

s=5:20 -3=17≡5

s=6:24 -3=21≡9

s=7:28 -3=25≡1

s=8:32 -3=29≡5

s=9:36 -3=33≡9

s=10:40 -3=37≡1

s=11:44 -3=41≡5

s=12:48 -3=45≡9

So, cycle repeats every3 s's: t=1,5,9,1,5,9,...

Thus, for s=1 to12, t=1,5,9,1,5,9,1,5,9,1,5,9.

Similarly, for s=13 to24, same pattern.

Therefore, in each block of12 s's, t cycles through1,5,9 three times.

Thus, for each t in{1,5,9}, there are12 /3=4 blocks, each contributing3 s's per t.

Wait, maybe better:

In each12 s's, t=1 occurs4 times, t=5 occurs4 times, t=9 occurs4 times.

Wait, looking at s=1: t=1

s=4:t=1

s=7:t=1

s=10:t=1

So, t=1 occurs at s≡1 mod3.

Similarly, t=5 occurs at s≡2 mod3.

t=9 occurs at s≡0 mod3.

Thus, in each12 s's:

t=1 occurs4 times (s=1,4,7,10)

t=5 occurs4 times (s=2,5,8,11)

t=9 occurs4 times (s=3,6,9,12)

So, in each12 s's, t=1,5,9 each occur4 times.

Therefore, for each t=1,5,9, number of s's is4 in each12 s block.

But now, for each s, t is determined, and then number of r's is floor((100 -t)/12) +1.

So, for t=1:

number of r's= floor(99/12)+1=8 +1=9

Similarly, t=5:

floor(95/12)=7, 7 +1=8

t=9:

floor(91/12)=7,7 +1=8

Wait, let's compute:

For t=1:

Number of r's= floor((100 -1)/12)+1= floor(99/12)=8 (since12*8=96, 12*9=108>99) +1=9

t=5:

floor(95/12)=7 (12*7=84, 12*8=96>95) +1=8

t=9:

floor(91/12)=7 (12*7=84, 12*8=96>91) +1=8

So, for t=1, number of r's=9; for t=5,8; t=9,8.

But since t=1,5,9 each occur4 times per12 s's, the total number of ordered pairs contributed by each t:

t=1:4*(9)=36

t=5:4*(8)=32

t=9:4*(8)=32

Therefore, total per12 s's:36 +32 +32=100.

Wait, but s runs from1 to100, which is8 full blocks of12 s's (96 s's) plus4 extra s's (97,98,99,100).

Wait, but in reality, s doesn't reset every12; t cycles every3 s's.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of the entire s=1 to100 as consisting of8 full cycles of12 s's (96 s's) plus4 extra s's.

In each12 s's:

Total ordered pairs=100 as above.

But wait, no, actually, each12 s's contribute100 ordered pairs? No, that can't be.

Wait, no, for each s, we compute the number of r's.

But in each12 s's, t=1,5,9 each occur4 times.

Each occurrence of t=1 contributes9 r's

Each t=5 contributes8

Each t=9 contributes8

Thus, per12 s's:4*(9 +8 +8)=4*25=100 ordered pairs.

But s=1 to12:100 ordered pairs? That seems too high because for each s, r is specific.

Wait, no, actually, for each s, r is unique per s.

Wait, no, no, in fact, for each s, there can be multiple r's.

Wait, but in the first12 s's, the number of ordered pairs (r,s) is100. But since s=1 to12, that would imply on average8 or9 r's per s, which contradicts our prior result where for each s, the number of r's is either8 or9.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing things.

Wait, no, for each s, we have a certain number of r's, which can be8 or9.

But when we aggregate over s=1 to100, each s contributes a certain number of r's.

But in the approach where t=1,5,9 each occur4 times per12 s's, and each occurrence leads to certain number of r's, then over12 s's, we have4*9 +4*8 +4*8=36 +32 +32=100.

But s=1 to12:100 ordered pairs.

But for each s, number of r's is either8 or9.

But 12 s's, each contributing8 or9 r's, leading to100 ordered pairs, but 12 s's, each can have variable r's, but the total being100.

Wait, that seems inconsistent because12 s's, each with say9 r's, would be108 r's, but since each r is counted once, but overlapping.

Wait, perhaps it's better to stick with the first method.

Earlier, we found that for r≡1 mod4, there are25 r's, each with certain s's.

In that approach, we got742 ordered pairs.

But now, in the second approach, considering t=1,5,9 cycling every12 s's, and per12 s's,100 ordered pairs, but over100 s's, it's 8 full blocks (96 s's) contributing8*100=800, and4 extra s's contributing something.

Wait, but that seems conflicting.

Wait, let's try again.

If in each12 s's, the number of ordered pairs is100, then for100 s's, which is8*12 +4, so8*100 + ?

But that seems off because each12 s's don't contribute100 ordered pairs.

Wait, no, actually, per12 s's, the number of ordered pairs is100, but in reality, each ordered pair is unique.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute it as follows:

Total number of ordered pairs= sum_{s=1}^{100} [number of r's for each s].

Where for each s, number of r's= floor((100 -t)/12) +1, t=4s -3 mod12, t≠0→12.

So, to compute this sum, notice that t cycles through1,5,9 as s increases.

Each t=1,5,9 occurs floor(100 /12)=8 times, with4 extra s's beyond8*12=96.

So, for s=1 to96, t=1,5,9 each occur8 times.

Each occurrence of t=1,5,9 contributes:

For t=1: floor(99/12)=8, so number of r's=8 +1=9

For t=5: floor(95/12)=7, so number of r's=7 +1=8

For t=9: floor(91/12)=7, so number of r's=7 +1=8

So, per t:

t=1:9 r's

t=5:8 r's

t=9:8 r's

Each t occurs8 times in the first96 s's.

Thus, total ordered pairs for s=1 to96:

8*(9 +8 +8)=8*25=200.

Now, for s=97 to100:

These correspond to t=4*97 -3=385≡385 mod12.

Compute385 /12=32*12=384, so385≡1 mod12.

Thus, t=1 for s=97

Similarly, s=98: t=4*98 -3=392 -3=389≡5 mod12

s=99: t=4*99 -3=396 -3=393≡9 mod12

s=100: t=4*100 -3=397≡1 mod12

So, for s=97: t=1

s=98: t=5

s=99:t=9

s=100:t=1

Thus, for s=97: number of r's=9

s=98:8

s=99:8

s=100:9

Total for s=97 to100:9 +8 +8 +9=34.

Therefore, total ordered pairs=200 +34=234.

But wait, that conflicts with prior counts.

Wait, no, because in the first approach, when r≡1 mod4, we had25 r's, each with varying s's, totaling742.

But in this second approach, computing based on s, we get234 ordered pairs.

These are conflicting results, so something is wrong.

Wait, actually, in the first approach, we considered r≡1 mod4, which are25 r's, each with certain s's.

But in the second approach, considering t=4s -3 mod12, and hence the number of s's for each t, leading to a total of234 ordered pairs.

But which one is correct?

Wait, another sanity check:

Total ordered pairs should satisfy the condition i * w^r = z^s.

But let's think about the equation geometrically.

Both w and z are 12th roots of unity, but with different angles.

Specifically, w = e^(iπ/6)=e^(i2π/12), which is a primitive12th root.

z=e^(i2π/3)=e^(i8π/12), which is a primitive3rd root.

Thus, w^r is another primitive12th root, and z^s is another12th root (since z^s = e^(i2πs/3) = e^(i8πs/12)).

Therefore, both sides are12th roots, so the equation i*w^r=z^s must hold in the multiplicative group of complex numbers on the unit circle.

But since i is also a12th root, the equation becomes:

e^(iπ/2) * e^(iπr/6) = e^(i2πs/3)

Simplify:

e^(i(π/2 + πr/6)) = e^(i2πs/3)

Thus,

π/2 + πr/6 ≡2πs/3 mod2π

Divide both sides byπ:

1/2 + r/6 ≡2s/3 mod2

Multiply by6:

3 + r ≡4s mod12

So, same as before.

Thus, for each solution (r,s), we have r ≡4s -3 mod12.

Given that, for each s, r is uniquely determined mod12.

But r must be in1 to100, so for each s, there are floor((100 - (4s -3))/12) +1 r's.

Wait, no, actually, r=4s -3 +12k, with r≥1, so k≥max(0, (1 -4s +3)/12)=max(0, (4 -4s)/12).

But since s≥1, 4 -4s ≤0, so k≥0.

Thus, for each s, r=4s -3 +12k, k=0,1,...,K where4s -3 +12K≤100.

Thus, K= floor((100 -4s +3)/12)=floor((103 -4s)/12).

But since r must be≥1, 4s -3 +12k≥1⇒k≥max(0, (1 -4s +3)/12)=max(0, (4 -4s)/12)=max(0, (1 -s)/3).

But since s≥1, (1 -s)/3≤0, so k≥0.

Therefore, number of r's per s= floor((103 -4s)/12) +1.

Wait, for example, for s=1:

floor((103 -4)/12)=floor(99/12)=8⇒8 +1=9.

Which matches our prior calculation.

Similarly, s=2:

floor((103 -8)/12)=floor(95/12)=7⇒7 +1=8.

Which also matches.

Thus, for each s, number of r's=floor((103 -4s)/12) +1.

Hence, total ordered pairs= sum_{s=1}^{100} [floor((103 -4s)/12) +1]

To compute this sum, note that floor((103 -4s)/12) is the same as floor((103 -4s)/12).

Let me make substitution: let k=4s -3 mod12.

But perhaps it's better to find how many s's yield each residue t=4s -3 mod12.

But as observed earlier, t=1,5,9 repeat every3 s's.

Each t corresponds to a different number of r's.

But perhaps another approach is needed.

Alternatively, note that the number of ordered pairs is equal to the number of solutions (r,s)∈{1,…,100}×{1,…,100} satisfying r≡4s -3 mod12.

Which is equivalent to r≡(4s -3) mod12.

Thus, for each s, r must be≡c mod12, where c=4s -3 mod12.

But since r is from1 to100, for each s, the number of r's is floor((100 -c)/12) +1.

Thus, total ordered pairs= sum_{s=1}^{100} [floor((100 - (4s -3 mod12))/12) +1]

But calculating this directly is tedious, but maybe we can find a formula.

Notice that 4s -3 mod12 cycles every3 s's.

Indeed, as s increases by3,4s increases by12≡0 mod12, so4s -3 mod12 cycles through(4(s+3)-3)=(4s +12 -3)=4s +9≡4s -3 mod12.

Thus, the residues cycle every3 s's.

Thus, we can partition the s's into groups of3, where each group corresponds to the same set of residues mod12.

Therefore, for s=1,2,3: residues t=1,5,9

s=4,5,6: residues t=1,5,9

and so on.

Each group of3 s's corresponds to t=1,5,9.

Thus, for each group of3 s's, we can compute the number of r's per t and multiply by3.

Wait, no, for each group of3 s's, each t=1,5,9 occurs once.

Thus, for each group of3 s's:

Number of r's for t=1: floor((100 -1)/12) +1= floor(99/12) +1=8 +1=9

For t=5: floor((100 -5)/12) +1= floor(95/12) +1=7 +1=8

For t=9: floor((100 -9)/12) +1= floor(91/12) +1=7 +1=8

Thus, per group of3 s's:9 +8 +8=25 ordered pairs.

Since s ranges from1 to100, which is33 full groups of3 s's (99 s's) and1 extra s.

Each full group contributes25 ordered pairs.

Thus, total ordered pairs=33*25 + number of ordered pairs for s=100.

Wait, no, s=1 to99 is33 groups of3, contributing33*25=825.

Then, s=100: t=4*100 -3=397≡1 mod12.

Thus, number of r's for s=100:floor((100 -1)/12) +1=9 +1=10.

Wait, but r must be≤100.

Wait, r=4s -3 +12k.

For s=100: r=4*100 -3 +12k=397 +12k.

Find k such that1≤397 +12k ≤100.

But397 >100, so no solution.

Wait, that can't be.

Wait, no, correction: r=4s -3 +12k.

But s=100:r=4*100 -3 +12k=397 +12k.

But r must be≤100, so397 +12k ≤100⇒12k ≤-297⇒k≤-25.5.

But k must be≥0, so no solutions.

Wait, that suggests that for s=100, there are0 r's.

But earlier, when we computed t=1 for s=100, and thought number of r's=9, but actually, since r must be≤100, it's impossible because4*100 -3=397, which is way beyond100.

Wait, perhaps my initial assumption was wrong.

Wait, no, actually, when we defined t=4s -3 mod12, but r= t +12k.

But r must be at least1, so t +12k ≥1.

But for s=100, t=4*100 -3=397≡1 mod12.

Thus, r=1 +12k.

But1 +12k ≤100⇒12k ≤99⇒k≤8.25⇒k=0 to8.

Thus, r=1,13,25,...,97.

So, number of r's= floor(99/12) +1=8 +1=9.

But r=1 +12*8=97≤100.

So, for s=100, number of r's=9.

But earlier, when I computed t=4s -3=397≡1 mod12, and thought number of r's= floor((100 -1)/12) +1=9.

But in this case, r=1,13,...,97, which is9 terms.

But wait, if s=100, t=1, r=1 +12k, k=0 to8: r=1,13,25,37,49,61,73,85,97: total9 r's.

Thus, s=100 contributes9 r's.

But wait, earlier, I thought that for s=100, t=1, which would require r=1,13,...,97, which is9 r's.

But when we considered s=97, which maps tot=1, we had r=97,85,73,...,1: which is9 r's as well.

Wait, so s=97:9 r's, s=98:8, s=99:8, s=100:9.

Thus, for s=97 to100:9 +8 +8 +9=34.

But when we calculated the total for s=1 to99:33 groups of3 s's, each contributing25, so33*25=825.

Plus s=100:34?

No, wait, no, for s=97 to100, which is4 s's, contributing34 ordered pairs.

But in reality, s=97 to100 correspond to t=1,5,9,1.

Thus, t=1,5,9,1.

Each t=1: s=97,100:2 s's with t=1, each contributing9 r's.

Wait, no, s=97: t=1, s=98:t=5, s=99:t=9, s=100:t=1.

So, t=1:2 s's, each contributing9 r's.

t=5:1 s, contributing8 r's.

t=9:1 s, contributing8 r's.

Thus, total ordered pairs for s=97 to100:2*9 +8 +8=18 +16=34.

Thus, overall total:

s=1 to96:32 groups of3 s's (since96 /3=32), each contributing25, so32*25=800.

s=97 to100:34.

Thus, total ordered pairs=800 +34=834.

But wait, s=1 to96:32 groups of3 s's, each group contributing25.

s=97 to100:34.

But wait, earlier, when s=1 to96, grouped into32 groups, each contributing25.

But s=1 to96:96 s's, which is32*3.

Each group of3 s's (s=3k+1,3k+2,3k+3) contributes25.

Thus, 32*25=800.

Then, s=97,98,99,100:34.

Thus, total=800 +34=834.

But wait, when s=1 to96, we have32 groups, each contributing25, so800.

Then, s=97: t=1, contributing9 r's

s=98: t=5, contributing8 r's

s=99: t=9, contributing8 r's

s=100: t=1, contributing9 r's

Total for s=97-100:9 +8 +8 +9=34.

Thus, total=800 +34=834.

But earlier, when we considered r≡1 mod4, we had25 r's, each with varying s's.

But let's check what's the relation between these two methods.

25 r's, each with varying s's.

But perhaps the discrepancy arises because in the first approach, we considered each r≡1 mod4, and for each such r, computed the number of s's.

But in the second approach, we considered each s and computed the number of r's, which might include overlapping counts.

Wait, but the total number should be the same.

But 25 r's, each with varying s's: total ordered pairs= sum_{r≡1 mod4} number_of_s's_for_r.

But without knowing the exact distribution, it's hard to compute.

Alternatively, let me cross-validate.

If total ordered pairs=834, then that should equal the number of s's multiplied by something.

But 100 s's, each with varying r's.

Alternatively, another approach:

The equation is i * w^r = z^s.

Taking absolute values, both sides have absolute value1, so equality holds.

Taking arguments:

Arg(i) + Arg(w^r)=Arg(z^s)

=> π/2 + r*(π/6)=s*(2π/3) mod2π

Multiplying both sides by6/π:

3 + 2r =4s mod12

Thus,

2r ≡4s -3 mod12

Simplify:

Divide both sides by GCD(2,12)=2.

But since4s -3 must be even.

But4s is always even,4s -3 is odd, so left-hand side2r is even≡odd mod12?

Wait, that can't be.

Wait, 2r ≡ odd mod12.

But 2r is even, so can't be congruent to odd mod12.

Contradiction?

Wait, that suggests no solutions.

But we know that when r=1,s=1: i * w = z^1.

Check:

i * w = i*e^(iπ/6)=e^(iπ/2)*e^(iπ/6)=e^(i2π/3)=z.

Thus, yes, r=1,s=1 is a solution.

But according to the congruence:

2r ≡4s -3 mod12

For r=1,s=1:

2*1=2≡4*1 -3=1 mod12

But 2≡1 mod12? No, that's false.

Thus, contradiction.

What's happening here?

Ah, perhaps the issue is that when dividing by2, the modulus must also be adjusted.

Wait, originally, we had:

π/2 + rπ/6 ≡2πs/3 mod2π

Multiply by6/π:

3 +2r ≡4s mod12

So, 2r ≡4s -3 mod12

But4s -3 is odd, while2r is even.

Thus, equation 2r≡odd mod12 is impossible, since2r is even and odd≡even mod12 is false.

But yet, we have a solution.

This suggests that our initial approach is flawed.

Wait, but in reality, when we plug in r=1,s=1, we get equality.

So, perhaps the issue is that when taking modulo operations, we lose some information.

Alternatively, perhaps when multiplying, the angles wrap around, so the equation can hold despite the modular inconsistency.

Wait, but according to the equation,2r ≡4s -3 mod12, which is impossible because2r is even,4s -3 is odd.

But r=1,s=1:2*1=2≡4*1 -3=1 mod12? 2≡1? No.

So, contradiction.

Thus, is r=1,s=1 actually a solution?

Yes, as per direct computation:

i * w= i * e^(iπ/6)=e^(iπ/2)*e^(iπ/6)=e^(i2π/3)=z.

So, z^1=e^(i2π/3).

Thus, it works.

But according to the equation2r ≡4s -3 mod12, it's2≡1 mod12, which is false.

Therefore, the error lies in the derivation.

Wait, going back:

We had:

i * w^r = z^s

Which in exponentials:

e^(iπ/2) * e^(iπr/6)=e^(i2πs/3)

Thus,

e^(i(π/2 + πr/6))=e^(i2πs/3)

Thus,

π/2 + πr/6 ≡2πs/3 mod2π

Multiply both sides by6/π:

3 + r ≡4s mod12

Thus, equation is:

r ≡4s -3 mod12

Wait, not2r≡4s -3.

Earlier, I mistakenly wrote2r, but it's actually r≡4s -3 mod12.

That was the mistake!

So, correct equation isr ≡4s -3 mod12, not2r≡4s -3.

Thus, this changes everything.

So, the correct congruence isr ≡4s -3 mod12.

Thus, for each s, r must be≡4s -3 mod12.

Which is different from what I thought before.

Thus, to recap:

Equation isr ≡4s -3 mod12.

Therefore, for each s, r must be≡(4s -3) mod12.

Which is similar to the prior, but without the factor of2.

Thus, for each s, r can be written as:

r=12k + (4s -3) mod12.

But since r must be≥1 and≤100, we can write r=12k + t, wheret=4s -3 mod12.

Thus, for each s, t=4s -3 mod12, and r= t +12k.

Number of r's per s: floor((100 -t)/12) +1.

Therefore, the total number of ordered pairs is sum_{s=1}^{100} [floor((100 - (4s -3 mod12))/12) +1].

But since t=4s -3 mod12 cycles every3 s's.

Let me compute t=4s -3 mod12.

Since4 and12 share a common factor of4, the period is3.

So, for s=1:4*1 -3=1 mod12

s=2:8 -3=5 mod12

s=3:12 -3=9 mod12

s=4:16 -3=13≡1 mod12

s=5:20 -3=17≡5 mod12

s=6:24 -3=21≡9 mod12

Thus, t cycles through1,5,9 as s increases by1.

Thus, for s=1,4,7,...:t=1

s=2,5,8,...:t=5

s=3,6,9,...:t=9

Therefore, for each s, t cycles through1,5,9.

Thus, for each s, t=1,5,9 repeating every3 s's.

Thus, for each group of3 consecutive s's, t=1,5,9.

Thus, for each group of3 s's, the corresponding r's are:

For t=1: floor((100 -1)/12) +1=8 +1=9

For t=5: floor((100 -5)/12) +1=7 +1=8

For t=9: floor((100 -9)/12) +1=7 +1=8

Thus, per group of3 s's, ordered pairs=9 +8 +8=25.

Since s=1 to100 includes33 full groups of3 s's (99 s's) and1 extra s (s=100).

Each group contributes25 ordered pairs.

Thus, total ordered pairs=33*25 + number of pairs for s=100.

Now, for s=100:

t=4*100 -3=397≡397 -33*12=397 -396=1 mod12.

Thus, t=1.

Number of r's=floor((100 -1)/12) +1=8 +1=9.

Thus, s=100 contributes9 ordered pairs.

Therefore, total ordered pairs=33*25 +9=825 +9=834.

So, the total number is834.

Therefore, after correcting my earlier mistake, the answer is834.

**Final Answer**

Given \( w = \dfrac{\sqrt{3} + i}{2} \) and \( z = \dfrac{-1 + i\sqrt{3}}{2} \), where \( i = \sqrt{-1} \), we need to find the number of ordered pairs \((r, s)\) of positive integers not exceeding 100 that satisfy the equation \( i \cdot w^r = z^s \).

First, we express \( w \) and \( z \) in exponential form:
- \( w = \dfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \dfrac{i}{2} \) can be written as \( e^{i\pi/6} \).
- \( z = \dfrac{-1}{2} + \dfrac{i\sqrt{3}}{2} \) can be written as \( e^{i2\pi/3} \).

Rewriting the given equation \( i \cdot w^r = z^s \) in exponential form:
- \( i = e^{i\pi/2} \)
- \( w^r = (e^{i\pi/6})^r = e^{i\pi r/6} \)
- \( z^s = (e^{i2\pi/3})^s = e^{i2\pi s/3} \)

Thus, the equation becomes:
\[ e^{i(\pi/2 + \pi r/6)} = e^{i2\pi s/3} \]

Equating the arguments modulo \( 2\pi \):
\[ \frac{\pi}{2} + \frac{\pi r}{6} \equiv \frac{2\pi s}{3} \pmod{2\pi} \]

Multiplying through by \( \frac{6}{\pi} \):
\[ 3 + r \equiv 4s \pmod{12} \]

This simplifies to:
\[ r \equiv 4s - 3 \pmod{12} \]

For each \( s \), \( r \) must be congruent to \( 4s - 3 \mod 12 \). We need to count the number of valid \( r \) for each \( s \) from 1 to 100.

The sequence \( 4s - 3 \mod 12 \) cycles every 3 values of \( s \). Specifically, for \( s \equiv 1, 2, 3 \pmod{3} \), the values are 1, 5, 9 respectively. This cycle repeats every 3 values of \( s \).

For each group of 3 values of \( s \), the number of valid \( r \) values is:
- For \( t = 1 \): 9 values
- For \( t = 5 \): 8 values
- For \( t = 9 \): 8 values

Thus, each group of 3 values of \( s \) contributes 25 ordered pairs. There are 33 such groups in 99 values of \( s \), contributing \( 33 \times 25 = 825 \) ordered pairs. 

For the remaining \( s = 100 \):
- \( t = 1 \) contributes 9 ordered pairs.

Adding these, the total number of ordered pairs is:
\[ 825 + 9 = 834 \]

Thus, the number of ordered pairs \((r, s)\) is \(\boxed{834}\).
