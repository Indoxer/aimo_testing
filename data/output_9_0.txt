 The problem: 
Let $w = \dfrac{\sqrt{3} + i}{2}$ and $z = \dfrac{-1 + i\sqrt{3}}{2},$ where $i = \sqrt{-1}.$ Find the number of ordered pairs $(r,s)$ of positive integers not exceeding $100$ that satisfy the equation $i \cdot w^r = z^s.$


Alright, so I have this problem here. Let me try to understand it step by step.

We are given two complex numbers:
- \( w = \dfrac{\sqrt{3} + i}{2} \)
- \( z = \dfrac{-1 + i\sqrt{3}}{2} \)

And we need to find the number of ordered pairs \( (r, s) \) of positive integers not exceeding 100 that satisfy the equation:
\[ i \cdot w^r = z^s \]

First off, both \( w \) and \( z \) look like complex numbers in the form \( a + ib \). Maybe they can be expressed in polar form? That might make exponentiation easier because when you raise a complex number to a power, you can use De Moivre's theorem.

Let me recall that any complex number \( a + ib \) can be written in polar form as \( r(\cos \theta + i \sin \theta) \), where \( r \) is the modulus and \( \theta \) is the argument.

So, let me compute the modulus and argument for both \( w \) and \( z \).

Starting with \( w \):
\( w = \dfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + i \cdot \dfrac{1}{2} \)
Modulus \( |w| \) is \( \sqrt{ (\sqrt{3}/2)^2 + (1/2)^2 } = \sqrt{ (3/4) + (1/4) } = \sqrt{1} = 1 \).
So, it's on the unit circle. Nice.

Argument \( \theta_w \): Since the real part is \( \sqrt{3}/2 \) and the imaginary part is \( 1/2 \), this corresponds to 30 degrees or \( \pi/6 \) radians in the first quadrant. So, \( \theta_w = \pi/6 \).

Therefore, \( w = \cos(\pi/6) + i \sin(\pi/6) \). So, using Euler's formula, \( w = e^{i\pi/6} \).

Now, moving on to \( z \):
\( z = \dfrac{-1}{2} + i \cdot \dfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \)
Compute modulus \( |z| \): \( \sqrt{ (-1/2)^2 + (\sqrt{3}/2)^2 } = \sqrt{ 1/4 + 3/4 } = \sqrt{1} = 1 \).
Again, it's on the unit circle.

Argument \( \theta_z \): Real part is negative, imaginary part is positive, so it's in the second quadrant. The reference angle would be \( \tan^{-1}( (\sqrt{3}/2) / (1/2) ) = \tan^{-1}( \sqrt{3} ) = \pi/3 \). Therefore, since it's in the second quadrant, \( \theta_z = \pi - \pi/3 = 2\pi/3 \).

Thus, \( z = \cos(2\pi/3) + i \sin(2\pi/3) = e^{i2\pi/3} \).

Great, now both \( w \) and \( z \) are expressed in exponential form. This should make taking powers straightforward.

So, let's rewrite the original equation:
\[ i \cdot w^r = z^s \]
Substitute \( w = e^{i\pi/6} \) and \( z = e^{i2\pi/3} \):
Left-hand side (LHS): \( i \cdot (e^{i\pi/6})^r = i \cdot e^{i r \pi/6} \)
Right-hand side (RHS): \( (e^{i2\pi/3})^s = e^{i 2\pi s /3} \)

But wait, what is \( i \) in exponential form? \( i \) is \( e^{i\pi/2} \) because \( e^{i\pi/2} = \cos(\pi/2) + i \sin(\pi/2) = 0 + i \cdot 1 = i \).

So, LHS becomes:
\( e^{i\pi/2} \cdot e^{i r \pi/6} = e^{i(\pi/2 + r \pi/6)} \)

Therefore, our equation simplifies to:
\[ e^{i(\pi/2 + r \pi/6)} = e^{i 2\pi s /3} \]

Since two complex numbers in exponential form are equal if their exponents differ by an integer multiple of \( 2\pi \). That is:
\[ \pi/2 + r \pi/6 = 2\pi s /3 + 2\pi k \]
for some integer \( k \).

Let me write that equation down:
\[ \frac{\pi}{2} + \frac{r \pi}{6} = \frac{2\pi s}{3} + 2\pi k \]

We can divide both sides by \( \pi \) to simplify:
\[ \frac{1}{2} + \frac{r}{6} = \frac{2s}{3} + 2k \]

Multiply all terms by 6 to eliminate denominators:
\[ 3 + r = 4s + 12k \]

Let me rearrange this equation:
\[ r = 4s + 12k - 3 \]

So, we have \( r \) expressed in terms of \( s \) and \( k \). Remember that both \( r \) and \( s \) are positive integers not exceeding 100. So, \( 1 \leq r \leq 100 \) and \( 1 \leq s \leq 100 \).

Our task is to find all pairs \( (r, s) \) such that \( r = 4s + 12k - 3 \) with \( r \) and \( s \) in the specified range.

But before that, let's note that \( k \) must be chosen such that \( r \) remains positive. Similarly, \( s \) must remain positive.

Let me think about possible values of \( k \). Let's analyze the equation:

\( r = 4s + 12k - 3 \)

Given that \( r \geq 1 \), so:
\[ 4s + 12k - 3 \geq 1 \]
\[ 4s + 12k \geq 4 \]
Which is always true for positive integers \( s, k \), since even if \( s=1 \) and \( k=0 \), \( 4 + 0 = 4 \geq 4 \). Wait, but if \( k=0 \), then \( r = 4s - 3 \). If \( s=1 \), \( r = 1 \). That seems okay.

However, \( k \) can't be too large, otherwise \( r \) will exceed 100.

Similarly, \( s \) has its own constraints. Since \( s \leq 100 \), and \( r \leq 100 \), let's see how \( k \) affects this.

Let me write the inequalities:

For \( r \leq 100 \):
\[ 4s + 12k - 3 \leq 100 \]
\[ 4s + 12k \leq 103 \]

Also, since \( s \geq 1 \):
\[ 4(1) + 12k - 3 \leq 100 \]
\[ 1 + 12k \leq 100 \]
\[ 12k \leq 99 \]
\[ k \leq 8.25 \]

Since \( k \) must be an integer, the maximum \( k \) can be is 8.

But let's check whether \( k=8 \) gives valid \( r \) and \( s \):

If \( k=8 \):
\( r = 4s + 12*8 -3 = 4s + 96 -3 = 4s + 93 \)
We need \( r \leq 100 \):
\( 4s + 93 \leq 100 \)
\( 4s \leq 7 \)
\( s \leq 7/4 \)
Since \( s \) is at least 1, the only possible value is \( s=1 \). Then \( r = 4*1 +93=97 \). So, pair (97,1) is valid for \( k=8 \).

Similarly, \( k=7 \):
\( r = 4s + 84 -3 = 4s + 81 \)
\( r \leq 100 \Rightarrow 4s +81 \leq100 \Rightarrow 4s \leq19 \Rightarrow s \leq4.75 \). So, \( s=1,2,3,4 \)
Calculating corresponding \( r \):
- s=1: r=85
- s=2: r=89
- s=3: r=93
- s=4: r=97

All these r's are ≤100, so those are acceptable. Each s from 1 to 4 gives a valid r.

Similarly, for each k from 0 up to 8, we can find possible s and r.

Wait, but earlier when k=0, we saw that s=1 gives r=1, which is valid. So, let's go step by step.

I think the approach is to iterate over possible k values from 0 upwards until the minimal r exceeds 100, then stop.

But to formalize it, let's consider k starting from 0.

Case 1: k=0
Equation: \( r = 4s -3 \)
Constraints:
- \( r \geq 1 \Rightarrow 4s -3 \geq1 \Rightarrow 4s \geq4 \Rightarrow s \geq1 \)
- \( r \leq100 \Rightarrow 4s -3 \leq100 \Rightarrow 4s \leq103 \Rightarrow s \leq25.75 \)
Thus, s can be from 1 to25, inclusive. So, 25 solutions for k=0.

Case 2: k=1
Equation: \( r =4s +12 -3=4s+9 \)
Constraints:
- \( 4s +9 \leq100 \Rightarrow4s \leq91 \Rightarrow s \leq22.75 \Rightarrow s=1 to22 \)
Total solutions:22

Case3: k=2
\( r=4s +24 -3=4s+21 \)
\(4s +21 \leq100 \Rightarrow4s \leq79 \Rightarrow s \leq19.75 \Rightarrow s=1 to19 \)
Solutions:19

Case4: k=3
\( r=4s +36 -3=4s+33 \)
\(4s +33 \leq100 \Rightarrow4s \leq67 \Rightarrow s \leq16.75 \Rightarrow s=1 to16 \)
Solutions:16

Case5:k=4
\( r=4s +48 -3=4s+45 \)
\(4s +45 \leq100 \Rightarrow4s \leq55 \Rightarrow s \leq13.75 \Rightarrow s=1 to13 \)
Solutions:13

Case6:k=5
\( r=4s +60 -3=4s+57 \)
\(4s +57 \leq100 \Rightarrow4s \leq43 \Rightarrow s \leq10.75 \Rightarrow s=1 to10 \)
Solutions:10

Case7:k=6
\( r=4s +72 -3=4s+69 \)
\(4s +69 \leq100 \Rightarrow4s \leq31 \Rightarrow s \leq7.75 \Rightarrow s=1 to7 \)
Solutions:7

Case8:k=7
\( r=4s +84 -3=4s+81 \)
\(4s +81 \leq100 \Rightarrow4s \leq19 \Rightarrow s \leq4.75 \Rightarrow s=1 to4 \)
Solutions:4

Case9:k=8
\( r=4s +96 -3=4s+93 \)
\(4s +93 \leq100 \Rightarrow4s \leq7 \Rightarrow s \leq1.75 \Rightarrow s=1 \)
Solution:1

Case10:k=9
\( r=4s +108 -3=4s+105 \)
But \(4s +105 \leq100\) would require \(4s \leq-5\), which is impossible. Thus, no solutions for k=9 onwards.

So, summarizing:

k : Number of solutions
0 :25
1 :22
2 :19
3 :16
4 :13
5 :10
6 :7
7 :4
8 :1
Total: ?

Let me add them up step by step.

Start adding from k=0 to k=8:

25 (k=0)
25 +22=47 (k=0,1)
47 +19=66 (k=0,1,2)
66 +16=82 (k=0,1,2,3)
82 +13=95 (k=0,1,2,3,4)
95 +10=105 (k=0,...,5)
105 +7=112 (k=0,...,6)
112 +4=116 (k=0,...,7)
116 +1=117 (k=0,...,8)

Wait, hold on, that adds up to 117. But let me verify:

From k=0:25
k=1:22 → total 47
k=2:19 → 66
k=3:16 →82
k=4:13→95
k=5:10→105
k=6:7→112
k=7:4→116
k=8:1→117

Yes, total 117 ordered pairs.

But hold on! I have to ensure that for each k, the resulting r and s are positive integers not exceeding 100, which we considered when setting the bounds. So, each solution counted is valid.

But just to cross-validate, perhaps another approach could be taken?

Alternatively, looking back at the original equation:
\( i \cdot w^r = z^s \)

Expressed in exponential form, as before, leads us to the condition:
\( e^{i(\pi/2 + r \pi/6)} = e^{i 2\pi s /3} \)

Which implies that the exponents differ by an integer multiple of \( 2\pi \). So,

\( \pi/2 + r \pi/6 = 2\pi s /3 + 2\pi k \)

Divide both sides by \( \pi \):

\( 1/2 + r/6 = 2s/3 + 2k \)

Multiply by 6:

\( 3 + r = 4s + 12k \)

So, same equation as before.

So, the equation is linear in r and s, with coefficients depending on k. So, solving for r:

\( r = 4s + 12k -3 \)

This equation shows that for each integer k, s must be such that r remains between 1 and 100.

Hence, for each k, s can range from 1 up to floor((100 + 3 -12k)/4). But perhaps more precise is:

For each k, solve for s:

From \( r =4s +12k -3 \leq100 \Rightarrow4s \leq103 -12k \Rightarrow s \leq(103 -12k)/4 \)

And \( r \geq1 \Rightarrow4s +12k -3 \geq1 \Rightarrow4s \geq4 -12k \Rightarrow s \geq(4 -12k)/4 =1 -3k \)

But since s must be at least 1, the lower bound is s≥ max(1, (1 -3k)).

But for k ≥0, (1 -3k)≤1, so s≥1.

Therefore, for each k, s ranges from1 to floor( (103 -12k)/4 )

But also, s must be positive integers, so floor((103 -12k)/4).

But since we already found for each k the number of s is as above, the total comes to 117.

Wait, but 25 +22 +19 +16 +13 +10 +7 +4 +1 =117.

But let me check for k=0: s=1 to25: 25 terms. Correct.

k=1:s=1 to22:22

k=2:s=1 to19:19

k=3:s=1 to16:16

k=4:s=1 to13:13

k=5:s=1 to10:10

k=6:s=1 to7:7

k=7:s=1 to4:4

k=8:s=1:1

Total:25+22=47; 47+19=66; 66+16=82;82+13=95;95+10=105;105+7=112;112+4=116;116+1=117.

Yes, 117 ordered pairs.

Wait, but let me think again—are there overlapping solutions for different k's?

In other words, could a particular (r,s) pair satisfy the equation for more than one k?

I don't think so, because each pair (r,s) defines a unique k via the equation.

Because once r and s are fixed, k is determined by \( k = ( \pi/2 + r \pi/6 - 2\pi s /3 ) / (2\pi) \)

But actually, in the equation \( \pi/2 + r \pi/6 = 2\pi s /3 + 2\pi k \), k is an integer uniquely determined by r and s. Because angles differing by multiples of \( 2\pi \) are equivalent in complex plane.

Therefore, for each (r,s), there is exactly one integer k that satisfies the equation. Hence, the count of 117 is correct without overcounting.

But hang on, the problem says "ordered pairs (r,s) of positive integers not exceeding 100". So, both r and s are between 1 and 100. Our calculation counts all such pairs that satisfy the equation, regardless of k, so as long as for each pair, the corresponding k exists, which it does.

But wait, do we need to ensure that k is an integer?

Yes, because the original equation involves periodicity of \( 2\pi \), so k must adjust so that the angles match modulo \( 2\pi \). Therefore, k must be integer. But in our derivation, k came out as integer because we subtracted angles and divided by \( 2\pi \). So, as long as the equation is satisfied, k will be integer.

Therefore, yes, each solution (r,s) corresponds to exactly one integer k, which may vary per pair.

Therefore, the total number of solutions is indeed 117.

But wait, just to make sure, let me test a couple of small cases.

Take k=0, s=1: r=4*1 -3=1. So, (1,1). Let's plug into the original equation:

Left-hand side: i * w^1 = i*(sqrt(3)/2 +i/2)=i*sqrt(3)/2 + i^2/2= i sqrt(3)/2 -1/2

Right-hand side: z^1= -1/2 +i sqrt(3)/2

Are these equal? Let's see:

Left-hand side: -1/2 + i sqrt(3)/2

Right-hand side: -1/2 + i sqrt(3)/2

Yes, they are equal. So, (1,1) is a valid solution.

Another example: k=0, s=25: r=4*25 -3=100 -3=97. So, (97,25). Let's check:

Left-hand side: i*w^97

But w is e^{i pi /6}, so w^97= e^{i 97 pi /6}. Let's compute 97 pi /6 modulo 2 pi.

Compute 97 /6=16.166..., so 16 full circles (32 pi) plus 0.166... pi. 0.166 pi is approximately pi/6, so 97 pi /6=16 pi + pi/6=8*2 pi + pi/6. Therefore, w^97= e^{i pi/6}=w.

Thus, i*w^97=i*w= left-hand side.

Right-hand side: z^{25}= [e^{i2 pi /3}]^{25}= e^{i50 pi /3}

Compute 50 pi /3 mod 2 pi:

50 /3≈16.666, so 16*2 pi=32 pi, 50 pi /3 -32 pi= (50 pi /3 -96 pi /3)= (-46 pi /3). Hmm, negative angle.

But angles are modulo 2 pi, so add 18 pi /3=6 pi:

(-46 pi /3)+6 pi= (-46 pi /3 +18 pi /3)= (-28 pi /3). Still negative. Add another 6 pi:

(-28 pi /3 +18 pi /3)= (-10 pi /3). Still negative. Add another 6 pi:

(-10 pi /3 +18 pi /3)=8 pi /3.

But 8 pi /3 is still larger than 2 pi, subtract 2 pi=8 pi /3 -6 pi /3=2 pi /3.

Thus, z^{25}=e^{i2 pi /3}=z.

So, LHS:i*w= Right-hand side:z.

Compute LHS: i*w= i*(sqrt(3)/2 +i/2)=i sqrt(3)/2 -1/2

RHS:z= -1/2 +i sqrt(3)/2, which is same as LHS.

Thus, (97,25) is a valid solution.

Another example: k=8, s=1: r=4*1 +93=97. Which is same as above.

Wait, so same (r,s)=(97,1) and (97,25). Different s, same r? Wait, no, for k=8, s=1: r=97.

Earlier for k=0, s=25: r=97. So, same r but different s. So, both (97,25) and (97,1) are valid solutions with different k.

So, each r can correspond to multiple s's, but in our case, for each k, a different set of (r,s) is generated.

Hence, 117 is the correct count.

Therefore, the number of ordered pairs is 117.

**Final Answer**
The number of ordered pairs is \boxed{117}.
</think>

Given the complex numbers \( w = \dfrac{\sqrt{3} + i}{2} \) and \( z = \dfrac{-1 + i\sqrt{3}}{2} \), we need to find the number of ordered pairs \((r, s)\) of positive integers not exceeding 100 that satisfy the equation \( i \cdot w^r = z^s \).

First, we express \( w \) and \( z \) in polar form:
- \( w \) has modulus 1 and argument \( \pi/6 \), so \( w = e^{i\pi/6} \).
- \( z \) has modulus 1 and argument \( 2\pi/3 \), so \( z = e^{i2\pi/3} \).

Rewriting the given equation in exponential form:
\[ i \cdot (e^{i\pi/6})^r = (e^{i2\pi/3})^s \]

Since \( i = e^{i\pi/2} \), the equation becomes:
\[ e^{i(\pi/2 + r \pi/6)} = e^{i 2\pi s /3} \]

Equating the exponents modulo \( 2\pi \):
\[ \frac{\pi}{2} + \frac{r \pi}{6} = \frac{2\pi s}{3} + 2\pi k \]
for some integer \( k \).

Dividing by \( \pi \) and multiplying by 6:
\[ 3 + r = 4s + 12k \]
Rearranging gives:
\[ r = 4s + 12k - 3 \]

We need \( r \) and \( s \) to be positive integers not exceeding 100. For each integer \( k \), we determine the range of \( s \) such that \( r \) remains within the bounds.

Analyzing the possible values of \( k \):
- For \( k = 0 \), \( r = 4s - 3 \). Valid \( s \) range: 1 to 25 (25 solutions).
- For \( k = 1 \), \( r = 4s + 9 \). Valid \( s \) range: 1 to 22 (22 solutions).
- For \( k = 2 \), \( r = 4s + 21 \). Valid \( s \) range: 1 to 19 (19 solutions).
- For \( k = 3 \), \( r = 4s + 33 \). Valid \( s \) range: 1 to 16 (16 solutions).
- For \( k = 4 \), \( r = 4s + 45 \). Valid \( s \) range: 1 to 13 (13 solutions).
- For \( k = 5 \), \( r = 4s + 57 \). Valid \( s \) range: 1 to 10 (10 solutions).
- For \( k = 6 \), \( r = 4s + 69 \). Valid \( s \) range: 1 to 7 (7 solutions).
- For \( k = 7 \), \( r = 4s + 81 \). Valid \( s \) range: 1 to 4 (4 solutions).
- For \( k = 8 \), \( r = 4s + 93 \). Valid \( s \) range: 1 (1 solution).

Summing the number of solutions for each \( k \):
\[ 25 + 22 + 19 + 16 + 13 + 10 + 7 + 4 + 1 = 117 \]

Thus, the number of ordered pairs \((r, s)\) is \(\boxed{117}\).
