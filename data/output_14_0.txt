 The problem: 
Ellina has twelve blocks, two each of red ($\textbf{R}$), blue ($\textbf{B}$), yellow ($\textbf{Y}$), green ($\textbf{G}$), orange ($\textbf{O}$), and purple ($\textbf{P}$). Call an arrangement of blocks $\textit{even}$ if there is an even number of blocks between each pair of blocks of the same color. For example, the arrangement
\[\textbf{R B B Y G G Y R O P P O}\]
is even. Ellina arranges her blocks in a row in random order. The probability that her arrangement is even is $\frac{m}{n},$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n.$


Alright, so I have this problem where Ellina has twelve blocks, two each of six different colors: red (R), blue (B), yellow (Y), green (G), orange (O), and purple (P). An arrangement is called "even" if there's an even number of blocks between each pair of blocks of the same color. I need to find the probability that a random arrangement is even, express it as a reduced fraction m/n, and then find m + n.

First, let me try to understand what an "even" arrangement means. The problem says there must be an even number of blocks between each pair of blocks of the same color. So, for example, if you have two red blocks somewhere in the row, the number of blocks between them should be even—0, 2, 4, etc. The example given is R B B Y G G Y R O P P O, which is an even arrangement. Let me check why. 

Looking at the example:

- The first R is at position 1, and the second R is at position 8. The number of blocks between them is 6 (positions 2 through 7). 6 is even, so that's good.
- The first B is at position 2, and the second B is at position 5. The number of blocks between them is 2 (positions 3 and 4). That's also even.
- The first Y is at position 4, and the second Y is at position 7. There are 2 blocks in between (positions 5 and 6). Even again.
- The first G is at position 6, and the second G is at position 7. Wait, they're adjacent? So zero blocks in between—that's even too.
- The first O is at position 9, and the second O is at position 12. Three blocks in between (positions 10, 11, 12). Wait, but position 12 is the end, so actually, from position 9 to 12, there are positions 10 and 11 in between—two blocks. Hmm, maybe my counting was off. If position 9 is the first O, then position 10 is next, then 11, then 12. So between 9 and 12, we have positions 10 and 11—so two blocks. Yeah, that's even.
- Similarly, for P: first P is at position 10, second P is at position 11. Adjacent again, so zero blocks in between—even.

So all pairs have an even number of blocks between them, hence it's an even arrangement.

Now, I need to figure out how many such arrangements exist and divide that by the total number of possible arrangements to get the probability.

Total number of arrangements: Since there are 12 blocks with two of each color, the total number of distinct arrangements is 12! divided by (2!)^6 because there are two identical blocks for each color. So, total arrangements = 12! / (2^6).

Now, the tricky part is figuring out how many even arrangements there are. An even arrangement requires that for each color, the two blocks of that color have an even number of blocks between them. So, if we denote the positions of the two blocks of color C as i and j (i < j), then j - i - 1 must be even. That implies that j - i is odd, meaning that the two positions are of opposite parity—they can't both be even or both be odd.

Wait, hold on—if j - i - 1 is even, then j - i is odd. So yes, their positions must be of opposite parity.

So, for each color, its two blocks must occupy positions of opposite parity. That is, one in an odd position and one in an even position.

Therefore, for each color, one block is in an odd slot and the other in an even slot.

But since there are six colors, each contributing two blocks, we have a total of 12 blocks. Now, considering that the entire arrangement will consist of 6 odd positions and 6 even positions.

If each color's two blocks must be in one odd and one even position, then across all colors, the total number of blocks in odd positions would be equal to the number of colors, which is 6, because each color contributes exactly one block to the odd positions and one to the even positions. Similarly, the number of blocks in even positions is also 6.

Therefore, an even arrangement is equivalent to arranging the blocks such that each color occupies one odd and one even position.

So, essentially, the problem reduces to assigning each color to one odd position and one even position, and then permuting them accordingly.

But wait, more precisely, the assignment is about pairing each color's two blocks into one odd and one even spot.

Let me think: there are 6 odd positions and 6 even positions. Each color needs to have one block in an odd position and one in an even position. Therefore, it's similar to matching the colors to the odd and even slots.

The way to count this is: assign each color to an odd and an even position. So, first, choose a permutation for the odd positions and a permutation for the even positions, and then combine them.

But perhaps another way is: assign each color's first occurrence to an odd position and the second occurrence to an even position, or vice versa. However, since the two blocks of each color are indistinct except for their positions, it might not matter which one goes first.

Alternatively, think of it as arranging the blocks so that for each color, the two blocks are placed in different parity positions.

Given that, how do we compute the number of such arrangements?

Well, perhaps we can model this as follows: We have 6 odd positions and 6 even positions. For each color, we need to place one block in the odd positions and one in the even positions. So, for each color, we can choose which position is odd and which is even.

But since all the blocks are being arranged, the process involves assigning each color to a unique pair of positions—one odd and one even.

So, the number of ways to arrange the blocks so that each color has one in odd and one in even positions is equal to:

(6! ways to permute the odd-positioned blocks) multiplied by (6! ways to permute the even-positioned blocks).

Because for each color, once we decide which position is odd and which is even, the blocks can be arranged independently in the odd and even slots.

But wait, hold on—is it just 6! * 6!? Because we can arrange the odd-position blocks in any order and the even-position blocks in any order, independent of each other.

Yes, that seems right. Because for each of the 6 odd positions, you can assign the blocks in any order, and similarly for the 6 even positions.

Therefore, the number of even arrangements is 6! * 6!.

Hence, the probability is (6! * 6!) divided by (12! / (2^6)).

Wait, let me confirm that.

Total number of arrangements is 12! / (2^6) because there are two identical blocks for each color.

Number of favorable arrangements is 6! * 6!: choosing permutations for the odd and even positions separately.

Thus, probability is (6! * 6!) / (12! / (2^6)).

Simplify this expression.

First, note that 12! = 12 × 11 × 10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6!.

So, 12! / (2^6) = (12 × 11 × 10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6!) / (2^6).

Then, numerator is 6! * 6!.

So, probability is [6! * 6!] / [12! / (2^6)] = [6! * 6! * 2^6] / 12!.

Let me write this as:

Probability = (6! * 6! * 2^6) / 12!

We can compute this fraction.

First, let's compute 12!:

12! = 479001600

6! = 720

So, 6! * 6! = 720 * 720 = 518400

And 2^6 = 64

So, numerator is 518400 * 64

Compute that: 518400 * 64

First, 518400 * 60 = 31,104,000

Then, 518400 * 4 = 2,073,600

Add them together: 31,104,000 + 2,073,600 = 33,177,600

Denominator is 12! = 479,001,600

So, probability is 33,177,600 / 479,001,600

Simplify this fraction.

Divide numerator and denominator by 100: 331,776 / 4,790,016

Hmm, maybe factor both numbers.

Alternatively, notice that 33,177,600 divides into 479,001,600 14.4 times? Wait, no, let's see:

Wait, 33,177,600 ÷ 479,001,600 = ?

Divide numerator and denominator by 1000: 33,177.6 / 479,001.6

But perhaps better to factor numerator and denominator.

Let’s factor numerator and denominator:

Numerator: 33,177,600 = 6! * 6! * 2^6 = (720)^2 * 64

Denominator: 12! = 479001600

Express everything in terms of prime factors.

6! = 720 = 2^4 * 3^2 * 5

So, 6! * 6! = (2^4 * 3^2 * 5)^2 = 2^8 * 3^4 * 5^2

Multiply by 2^6: 2^(8+6) * 3^4 * 5^2 = 2^14 * 3^4 * 5^2

12! = 479001600. Let's factorize 12!:

12! = 12 × 11 × 10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1

Breaking into prime factors:

12 = 2^2 * 3

11 = 11

10 = 2 * 5

9 = 3^2

8 = 2^3

7 = 7

6 = 2 * 3

5 = 5

4 = 2^2

3 = 3

2 = 2

1 = 1

Multiplying all together:

2^(2+1+3+1+2) * 3^(1+2+1+1) * 5^(1+1) * 7^1 * 11^1

Compute exponents:

For 2: 2(from12)+1(from10)+3(from8)+1(from6)+2(from4) = 2+1+3+1+2=9

Wait, no:

Wait, let's go step by step:

From 12: 2^2

From 11: 11^1

From 10: 2^1, 5^1

From 9: 3^2

From 8: 2^3

From 7:7^1

From 6: 2^1, 3^1

From 5:5^1

From 4:2^2

From 3:3^1

From 2:2^1

So, adding up the exponents for 2:

2 (from12) +1 (from10) +3 (from8) +1 (from6) +2 (from4) +1 (from2) = 2+1+3+1+2+1=10

Exponent for 3:

1 (from12) +2 (from9) +1 (from6) +1 (from3) = 1+2+1+1=5

Exponent for 5:

1 (from10) +1 (from5) = 2

Exponent for 7:1

Exponent for 11:1

So overall, 12! = 2^10 * 3^5 * 5^2 * 7 * 11

Similarly, numerator is 2^14 * 3^4 * 5^2

So, the probability is (2^14 * 3^4 * 5^2) / (2^10 * 3^5 * 5^2 * 7 * 11)

Simplify:

Cancel 5^2 from numerator and denominator.

Cancel 2^10 from numerator and denominator: numerator becomes 2^(14-10)=2^4, denominator becomes 2^0=1.

Cancel 3^4 from numerator and denominator: numerator becomes 3^(4-4)=3^0=1, denominator becomes 3^(5-4)=3^1.

So now, numerator is 2^4, denominator is 3^1 *7*11

So, probability = (16)/(3*7*11) = 16/(231)

Check if 16 and 231 have any common factors. 231 is divisible by 3 and 7 (231=3*7*11). 16 is 2^4. No common factors, so 16/231 is reduced.

Therefore, m =16, n=231, so m +n= 16+231=247.

Wait, before I conclude, let me double-check my steps because sometimes when dealing with factorials and combinatorics, it's easy to make a mistake.

1. Total arrangements: 12! / (2^6) = correct.

2. Number of even arrangements: 6! * 6! = correct because for each color, one block in odd and one in even, so arranging each set separately.

3. Probability calculation: (6! * 6! * 2^6) / 12! = correct.

4. Factorization:

- Numerator: 6! *6! *2^6= (720)^2 *64=518400*64=33177600.

- Denominator:12!=479001600.

Dividing these gives 33177600 / 479001600= 0.069264069..., which is approximately 16/231≈0.069264...

Yes, that matches.

Factorizing 33177600 and 479001600:

But as above, factoring 12! gave us 2^10 *3^5 *5^2 *7*11

Numerator after simplifying:2^4

Denominator remaining:3 *7 *11

Thus, 16 /231, which is reduced.

So, m=16, n=231, sum is 247.

Wait, hang on, 231 is 3×7×11, correct. And 16 is co-prime to 231. So yeah, that's reduced.

I think that is correct. So the final answer is 247.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{247}
</think>

Ellina has twelve blocks, two each of red (R), blue (B), yellow (Y), green (G), orange (O), and purple (P). An arrangement is called "even" if there is an even number of blocks between each pair of blocks of the same color. We need to find the probability that a random arrangement is even.

First, we note that the total number of distinct arrangements is given by:
\[
\frac{12!}{(2!)^6}
\]

An "even" arrangement requires that for each color, the two blocks have an even number of blocks between them. This means each color must occupy one odd position and one even position. 

There are 6 odd positions and 6 even positions. For each color, one block is placed in an odd position and one in an even position. The number of ways to arrange the blocks in the odd positions is \(6!\) and the number of ways to arrange the blocks in the even positions is also \(6!\). Therefore, the number of even arrangements is:
\[
6! \times 6!
\]

The probability is then calculated as:
\[
\frac{(6! \times 6!) \times 2^6}{12!}
\]

Simplifying this expression, we factorize the numerator and denominator:
- Numerator: \(6! \times 6! \times 2^6 = (720)^2 \times 64 = 33177600\)
- Denominator: \(12! = 479001600\)

After canceling common factors, we find:
\[
\frac{16}{231}
\]

Thus, the probability is \(\frac{16}{231}\), and the sum of the numerator and denominator is:
\[
16 + 231 = 247
\]

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{247}
\]
