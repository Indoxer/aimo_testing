 The problem: 
Let $w = \dfrac{\sqrt{3} + i}{2}$ and $z = \dfrac{-1 + i\sqrt{3}}{2},$ where $i = \sqrt{-1}.$ Find the number of ordered pairs $(r,s)$ of positive integers not exceeding $100$ that satisfy the equation $i \cdot w^r = z^s.$


To solve the problem, we start by expressing \(w\) and \(z\) in polar form. First, we note that \(w = \frac{\sqrt{3} + i}{2}\) can be written as \(w = \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{6}\right) + i\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{6}\right)\), which is \(w = e^{i\pi/6}\). Similarly, \(z = \frac{-1 + i\sqrt{3}}{2}\) can be written as \(z = \cos\left(\frac{2\pi}{3}\right) + i\sin\left(\frac{2\pi}{3}\right)\), which is \(z = e^{i2\pi/3}\).

Given the equation \(i \cdot w^r = z^s\), we substitute the polar forms of \(w\) and \(z\):
\[i \cdot e^{i\pi/6 \cdot r} = e^{i2\pi/3 \cdot s}.\]
We know that \(i = e^{i\pi/2}\), so the equation becomes:
\[e^{i\pi/2} \cdot e^{i\pi/6 \cdot r} = e^{i2\pi/3 \cdot s}.\]
Using the properties of exponents, we combine the terms on the left side:
\[e^{i(\pi/2 + \pi/6 \cdot r)} = e^{i2\pi/3 \cdot s}.\]
Since the exponential function is periodic with period \(2\pi\), we equate the exponents modulo \(2\pi\):
\[\frac{\pi}{2} + \frac{\pi}{6}r = \frac{2\pi}{3}s + 2k\pi\]
for some integer \(k\). Dividing through by \(\pi\) gives:
\[\frac{1}{2} + \frac{r}{6} = \frac{2s}{3} + 2k.\]
Multiplying through by 6 to clear the denominators, we get:
\[3 + r = 4s + 12k.\]
Rearranging terms, we have:
\[r - 4s = 12k - 3.\]
This is a linear Diophantine equation. We need to find the integer solutions \((r, s)\) such that \(1 \leq r, s \leq 100\). To do this, we first find a particular solution. Let \(k = 0\), then:
\[r - 4s = -3.\]
A particular solution is \(r = 3\) and \(s = 3\). The general solution to the equation \(r - 4s = -3\) is given by:
\[r = 3 + 4t,\]
\[s = 3 + t,\]
for any integer \(t\). We need \(1 \leq r \leq 100\) and \(1 \leq s \leq 100\). Substituting \(r = 3 + 4t\) and \(s = 3 + t\) into these inequalities, we get:
\[1 \leq 3 + 4t \leq 100,\]
\[1 \leq 3 + t \leq 100.\]
Solving these inequalities, we find:
\[-\frac{1}{2} \leq t \leq \frac{97}{4},\]
\[-2 \leq t \leq 97.\]
The intersection of these intervals is:
\[-2 \leq t \leq 24.\]
Thus, \(t\) can take any integer value from \(-2\) to \(24\), inclusive. This gives us \(24 - (-2) + 1 = 27\) possible values for \(t\). Therefore, there are \(\boxed{27}\) ordered pairs \((r, s)\) that satisfy the equation.
