 The problem: 
Adults made up $\frac5{12}$ of the crowd of people at a concert. After a bus carrying $50$ more people arrived, adults made up $\frac{11}{25}$ of the people at the concert. Find the minimum number of adults who could have been at the concert after the bus arrived.

Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- Adults made up \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the original crowd.
- After a bus carrying 50 more people arrived, adults made up \(\frac{11}{25}\) of the total people.

**Let’s define:**
- Let \( A \) be the number of adults initially.
- Let \( C \) be the total number of people initially.

**Step 1: Express the initial number of adults and children.**
\[
\frac{A}{C} = \frac{5}{12} \implies A = \frac{5}{12}C
\]
The number of children initially is:
\[
C - A = C - \frac{5}{12}C = \frac{7}{12}C
\]

**Step 2: After the bus arrives.**
- Total people become \( C + 50 \).
- Number of adults remains \( A \).
- The fraction of adults becomes \( \frac{11}{25} \):
\[
\frac{A}{C + 50} = \frac{11}{25}
\]
Substitute \( A = \frac{5}{12}C \):
\[
\frac{\frac{5}{12}C}{C + 50} = \frac{11}{25}
\]

**Step 3: Solve for \( C \).**
Cross-multiplied:
\[
25 \times \frac{5}{12}C = 11 \times (C + 50)
\]
Simplify:
\[
\frac{125}{12}C = 11C + 550
\]
Multiply both sides by 12 to eliminate fractions:
\[
125C = 132C + 6600
\]
Rearrange:
\[
-7C = 6600 \implies C = -942.857
\]
Since \( C \) must be positive, we consider the next possible integer multiple.

**Step 4: Find the minimum \( C \) such that \( C + 50 \) is divisible by 25.**
Let’s express \( C \) as:
\[
C = 12k \quad \text{(since \( A = \frac{5}{12}C \) must be an integer)}
\]
From earlier:
\[
C = -942.857 + 132n \quad \text{(where \( n \) is an integer)}
\]
To satisfy \( C > 0 \), find the smallest \( n \) such that:
\[
132n - 942.857 > 0 \implies n > \frac{942.857}{132} \approx 7.13
\]
So, \( n = 8 \).

Thus,
\[
C = 132 \times 8 - 942.857 = 1056 - 942.857 = 113.143
\]
But \( C \) must be a multiple of 12, so round up to the nearest multiple of 12:
\[
C = 120
\]
Therefore, the minimum number of adults after the bus arrived is:
\[
A_{\text{final}} = \frac{11}{25}(120 + 50) = \frac{11}{25} \times 170 = 74.8 \approx 75
\]
However, since the number of adults must be an integer, the exact minimum is when \( C = 120 \).

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{75}
\]
