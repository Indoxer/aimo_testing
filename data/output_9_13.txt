 The problem: 
Let $w = \dfrac{\sqrt{3} + i}{2}$ and $z = \dfrac{-1 + i\sqrt{3}}{2},$ where $i = \sqrt{-1}.$ Find the number of ordered pairs $(r,s)$ of positive integers not exceeding $100$ that satisfy the equation $i \cdot w^r = z^s.$


To solve the problem, we first express \( w \) and \( z \) in polar form. Note that \( w = \frac{\sqrt{3} + i}{2} \) can be written as \( w = e^{i\pi/6} \) because the magnitude of \( w \) is 1 and its argument is \( \frac{\pi}{6} \). Similarly, \( z = \frac{-1 + i\sqrt{3}}{2} \) can be written as \( z = e^{i2\pi/3} \) because the magnitude of \( z \) is 1 and its argument is \( \frac{2\pi}{3} \).

The given equation is \( i \cdot w^r = z^s \). Substituting the polar forms of \( w \) and \( z \), we get:
\[ i \cdot e^{i\pi/6 \cdot r} = e^{i2\pi/3 \cdot s}. \]
Since \( i = e^{i\pi/2} \), we can rewrite the left side as:
\[ e^{i\pi/2} \cdot e^{i\pi/6 \cdot r} = e^{i(\pi/2 + \pi/6 \cdot r)}. \]
Thus, the equation becomes:
\[ e^{i(\pi/2 + \pi/6 \cdot r)} = e^{i2\pi/3 \cdot s}. \]
This implies that the exponents must differ by an integer multiple of \( 2\pi \):
\[ \frac{\pi}{2} + \frac{\pi}{6} r = \frac{2\pi}{3} s + 2k\pi \]
for some integer \( k \). Dividing through by \( \pi \), we get:
\[ \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{6} r = \frac{2}{3} s + 2k. \]
Multiplying through by 6 to clear the denominators, we obtain:
\[ 3 + r = 4s + 12k. \]
Rearranging terms, we have:
\[ r = 4s + 12k - 3. \]
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((r, s)\) of positive integers not exceeding 100 that satisfy this equation. Since \( r \) and \( s \) are positive integers, we need \( 1 \leq r \leq 100 \) and \( 1 \leq s \leq 100 \). This gives us:
\[ 1 \leq 4s + 12k - 3 \leq 100. \]
Adding 3 to all parts of the inequality, we get:
\[ 4 \leq 4s + 12k \leq 103. \]
Dividing through by 4, we obtain:
\[ 1 \leq s + 3k \leq 25.75. \]
Since \( s \) and \( k \) are integers, we have:
\[ 1 \leq s + 3k \leq 25. \]
For each integer value of \( s \) from 1 to 25, we need to determine the possible integer values of \( k \). The smallest value of \( k \) is obtained when \( s + 3k = 1 \), which gives \( k = \left\lceil \frac{1-s}{3} \right\rceil \). The largest value of \( k \) is obtained when \( s + 3k = 25 \), which gives \( k = \left\lfloor \frac{25-s}{3} \right\rfloor \).

For each \( s \), the number of possible integer values of \( k \) is:
\[ \left\lfloor \frac{25-s}{3} \right\rfloor - \left\lceil \frac{1-s}{3} \right\rceil + 1. \]
We can calculate this for each \( s \) from 1 to 25:
- For \( s = 1 \), \( k \) ranges from 0 to 8, giving 9 values.
- For \( s = 2 \), \( k \) ranges from 0 to 7, giving 8 values.
- For \( s = 3 \), \( k \) ranges from 0 to 7, giving 8 values.
- For \( s = 4 \), \( k \) ranges from 0 to 7, giving 8 values.
- For \( s = 5 \), \( k \) ranges from 0 to 7, giving 8 values.
- For \( s = 6 \), \( k \) ranges from 0 to 7, giving 8 values.
- For \( s = 7 \), \( k \) ranges from 0 to 7, giving 8 values.
- For \( s = 8 \), \( k \) ranges from 0 to 7, giving 8 values.
- For \( s = 9 \), \( k \) ranges from 0 to 7, giving 8 values.
- For \( s = 10 \), \( k \) ranges from 0 to 7, giving 8 values.
- For \( s = 11 \), \( k \) ranges from 0 to 7, giving 8 values.
- For \( s = 12 \), \( k \) ranges from 0 to 7, giving 8 values.
- For \( s = 13 \), \( k \) ranges from 0 to 7, giving 8 values.
- For \( s = 14 \), \( k \) ranges from 0 to 7, giving 8 values.
- For \( s = 15 \), \( k \) ranges from 0 to 7, giving 8 values.
- For \( s = 16 \), \( k \) ranges from 0 to 7, giving 8 values.
- For \( s = 17 \), \( k \) ranges from 0 to 7, giving 8 values.
- For \( s = 18 \), \( k \) ranges from 0 to 7, giving 8 values.
- For \( s = 19 \), \( k \) ranges from 0 to 7, giving 8 values.
- For \( s = 20 \), \( k \) ranges from 0 to 7, giving 8 values.
- For \( s = 21 \), \( k \) ranges from 0 to 7, giving 8 values.
- For \( s = 22 \), \( k \) ranges from 0 to 7, giving 8 values.
- For \( s = 23 \), \( k \) ranges from 0 to 7, giving 8 values.
- For \( s = 24 \), \( k \) ranges from 0 to 7, giving 8 values.
- For \( s = 25 \), \( k \) ranges from 0 to 7, giving 8 values.

Summing these, we get:
\[ 9 + 8 \times 24 = 9 + 192 = 201. \]
Thus, the number of ordered pairs \((r, s)\) is \(\boxed{201}\).
