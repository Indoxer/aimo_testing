 The problem: 
Jen enters a lottery by picking $4$ distinct numbers from $S=\{1,2,3,\cdots,9,10\}.$ $4$ numbers are randomly chosen from $S.$ She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers were $2$ of the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers were the randomly chosen numbers. The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.


Alright, so Jen is playing this lottery game where she picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S = {1,2,3,...,10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S, and she wins a prize if at least two of her numbers match the chosen ones. She wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers match exactly. We need to find the probability that she wins the grand prize given that she already won a prize. They mention expressing this probability as m/n where m and n are coprime, and then finding m + n.

First, let me break down what is being asked here. It's a conditional probability problem. The formula for conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B). In this context, event A is "Jen wins the grand prize," and event B is "Jen wins a prize." So we need to compute P(A|B) which is equal to the probability that both A and B occur divided by the probability that B occurs.

But in this case, if A happens (she wins the grand prize), then it automatically means that B also happens because winning the grand prize is a subset of winning a prize. So, P(A ∩ B) is just P(A). Therefore, the conditional probability simplifies to P(A)/P(B).

So our task reduces to computing two probabilities:

1. P(A): The probability that Jen wins the grand prize, which is the probability that all four numbers she picked are exactly the four numbers drawn.
2. P(B): The probability that Jen wins at least two numbers, which includes winning exactly two, three, or all four numbers.

Once we have both probabilities, we can divide them to get the desired conditional probability.

Let's start by computing P(A). Since the lottery is random, each combination of four numbers is equally likely. The total number of possible combinations is C(10,4), which is the number of ways to choose 4 numbers out of 10 without regard to order.

C(10,4) is calculated as 10! / (4! * (10-4)!) = (10*9*8*7)/(4*3*2*1) = 210.

Since there's only one way for Jen's four numbers to match exactly the four drawn, P(A) = 1 / 210.

Now, onto P(B): the probability that Jen wins at least two numbers. This includes scenarios where she matches exactly 2, exactly 3, or exactly 4 numbers. However, since winning the grand prize (all four) is already considered in P(A), but in the definition of P(B), it's at least two, so it includes all those cases.

Wait, actually, hold on. I think I might be confusing something. Wait, no, in the problem statement, P(B) is defined as winning a prize, which requires at least two numbers. So yes, P(B) includes matching exactly 2, 3, or 4 numbers.

Therefore, to calculate P(B), we need to compute the number of favorable outcomes where exactly k numbers match, for k=2,3,4, summed over all such possibilities, divided by the total number of possible draws, which is 210.

Alternatively, another approach could be to compute 1 minus the probability of not winning any prizes. That is, 1 - [P(matching 0) + P(matching 1)]. But let's see which method is easier.

I think calculating directly for k=2,3,4 might be straightforward.

So, let's recall that in hypergeometric distribution terms, the number of ways to choose k successes (matching numbers) out of 4, and the remaining (4 - k) failures (non-matching numbers) out of the 6 non-jen numbers.

So, for exactly k matches, the number of favorable combinations is C(4,k) * C(6,4 - k). Hence, the total number of favorable combinations for at least two matches would be the sum over k=2 to 4 of C(4,k)*C(6,4 -k).

Therefore, the number of favorable outcomes for P(B) is:

For k=2: C(4,2)*C(6,2)
For k=3: C(4,3)*C(6,1)
For k=4: C(4,4)*C(6,0)

Compute each term:

C(4,2) = 6; C(6,2) = 15 → 6*15=90
C(4,3) = 4; C(6,1) = 6 → 4*6=24
C(4,4) = 1; C(6,0) = 1 → 1*1=1

Summing these up: 90 + 24 + 1 = 115.

Therefore, the number of favorable outcomes for P(B) is 115. Thus, P(B) = 115 / 210.

Similarly, the number of favorable outcomes for P(A) is 1, so P(A) = 1 / 210.

Therefore, the conditional probability P(A|B) = (1 / 210) / (115 / 210) = (1/210) * (210/115) = 1 / 115.

Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check my calculations again.

Total number of possible combinations: C(10,4)=210. Correct.

Number of favorable for P(A): 1, correct.

Number of favorable for P(B):

Exactly 2 matches: C(4,2)*C(6,2)=6*15=90
Exactly 3 matches: C(4,3)*C(6,1)=4*6=24
Exactly 4 matches: C(4,4)*C(6,0)=1*1=1
Total: 90+24+1=115. So P(B)=115/210.

Then, P(A|B) = P(A)/P(B) = (1/210)/(115/210) = 1/115.

So the probability is 1/115, so m=1, n=115. Are 1 and 115 coprime? Yes, since 115 factors into 5*23, neither of which divides 1. So m + n = 1 + 115 = 116.

Wait, but before I conclude, let me double-check whether my understanding of events was correct.

Event A: winning the grand prize, which is exactly matching all four numbers. Event B: winning a prize, which is at least two matches. So, indeed, A is a subset of B, hence P(A ∩ B) = P(A). Therefore, the conditional probability should be P(A)/P(B) = (1/210)/(115/210) = 1/115.

Yes, that seems correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I made an error in counting the number of favorable outcomes for P(B). Let me recount.

Number of ways to have exactly k matches:

For k=2: Choose 2 numbers from Jen's 4, and 2 numbers from the other 6. So C(4,2)*C(6,2)=6*15=90.

For k=3: C(4,3)*C(6,1)=4*6=24.

For k=4: C(4,4)*C(6,0)=1*1=1.

Total: 90+24+1=115. So that part checks out.

Another way to compute P(B) is 1 - P(0 matches) - P(1 match).

Compute P(0 matches): C(4,0)*C(6,4)=1*C(6,4)=15.

Thus, P(0 matches) = 15/210.

Compute P(1 match): C(4,1)*C(6,3)=4*20=80.

Thus, P(1 match)=80/210.

Hence, P(B) = 1 - (15 + 80)/210 = 1 - 95/210 = (210 - 95)/210 = 115/210. So same result.

So that's consistent.

Therefore, the conditional probability is 1/115, so m=1, n=115, thus m + n=116.

Just to ensure thoroughness, let me verify that 1 and 115 are coprime. Since 115 is 5×23, and 1 shares no common divisors with any number except 1. So yes, they are coprime.

Therefore, the answer is 116.

**Final Answer**
The value of \( m + n \) is \boxed{116}.
</think>

Jen enters a lottery by picking 4 distinct numbers from the set \( S = \{1, 2, 3, \ldots, 10\} \). Four numbers are randomly chosen from \( S \). She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers match the chosen ones, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers match. We need to find the probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize, expressed as \(\frac{m}{n}\) where \(m\) and \(n\) are coprime, and then find \(m + n\).

First, we calculate the total number of possible combinations of 4 numbers from 10, which is given by:
\[
\binom{10}{4} = 210
\]

The probability of winning the grand prize (event \(A\)) is:
\[
P(A) = \frac{1}{210}
\]

Next, we calculate the probability of winning at least two numbers (event \(B\)). This includes winning exactly 2, 3, or 4 numbers. Using the hypergeometric distribution, we find the number of favorable outcomes for each case:

- For exactly 2 matches:
  \[
  \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{6}{2} = 6 \times 15 = 90
  \]
- For exactly 3 matches:
  \[
  \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{6}{1} = 4 \times 6 = 24
  \]
- For exactly 4 matches:
  \[
  \binom{4}{4} \times \binom{6}{0} = 1 \times 1 = 1
  \]

Summing these, the total number of favorable outcomes for event \(B\) is:
\[
90 + 24 + 1 = 115
\]

Thus, the probability of winning at least two numbers is:
\[
P(B) = \frac{115}{210}
\]

The conditional probability \(P(A|B)\) is given by:
\[
P(A|B) = \frac{P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{\frac{1}{210}}{\frac{115}{210}} = \frac{1}{115}
\]

Here, \(m = 1\) and \(n = 115\). Since 1 and 115 are coprime, we find:
\[
m + n = 1 + 115 = 116
\]

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{116}
\]
