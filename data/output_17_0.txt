 The problem: 
Let $ABCD$ be a convex quadrilateral with $AB=2, AD=7,$ and $CD=3$ such that the bisectors of acute angles $\angle{DAB}$ and $\angle{ADC}$ intersect at the midpoint of $\overline{BC}.$ Find the square of the area of $ABCD.$


Okay, so I have this geometry problem here about a convex quadrilateral ABCD. The given information is AB = 2, AD = 7, and CD = 3. Also, it says that the bisectors of the acute angles at DAB and ADC intersect at the midpoint of BC. I need to find the square of the area of ABCD.

Hmm, let me try to visualize this quadrilateral first. Since it's convex, all its interior angles are less than 180 degrees. So, points A, B, C, D are arranged in order without any crossing over.

Given sides AB = 2, AD = 7, and CD = 3. So, starting from point A, moving to B which is 2 units away, then to C, then to D, which is 7 units from A, and then back to D, which is 3 units from C.

The key part here is about the angle bisectors. The bisectors of the acute angles at DAB and ADC intersect at the midpoint of BC. Let me denote M as the midpoint of BC. So, the angle bisectors from angles DAB (which is angle at A) and ADC (which is angle at D) meet at M.

I think coordinate geometry might help here. Maybe placing the quadrilateral on a coordinate system could simplify things. Let me assign coordinates to the points.

Let’s place point A at the origin (0, 0). Then, since AB = 2, maybe I can place point B at (2, 0). But wait, if I do that, I have to figure out where D is. Given that AD = 7, point D must be somewhere 7 units away from A. Let me assume point D has coordinates (x, y), so x² + y² = 49.

Now, point C is connected to D with CD = 3. So, once I have D, point C will be somewhere 3 units away from D. Hmm, but without knowing more, it's hard to fix their positions.

Wait, the midpoint M of BC is where the two angle bisectors meet. So, perhaps I can express M in terms of coordinates of B and C, then set up equations based on the angle bisector conditions.

But I don't know the coordinates of C yet. Maybe I should assign variables to them. Let me denote point C as (p, q). Then, since M is the midpoint of BC, its coordinates will be ((2 + p)/2, (0 + q)/2) = ((2 + p)/2, q/2).

Similarly, point D is (x, y), which we have x² + y² = 49.

Now, the angle bisectors from angles DAB and ADC meet at M. Let me recall that an angle bisector divides the angle into two equal parts and has a specific ratio property related to the adjacent sides.

For angle DAB, which is at point A between sides AD and AB. The angle bisector will divide the opposite side BC in the ratio of the adjacent sides. Similarly, for angle ADC, the angle bisector will divide the opposite side AB? Wait, no, actually, in triangle ABC, the angle bisector theorem applies, but here we have quadrilateral ABCD.

Wait, hold on, maybe I'm mixing something up. In a triangle, the angle bisector divides the opposite side in the ratio of the adjacent sides, but here we're dealing with a quadrilateral.

Perhaps instead, I should consider triangles formed within the quadrilateral.

Alternatively, maybe using vectors or coordinate geometry would be better.

Let me try coordinate geometry again. Assign coordinates:

- A: (0, 0)
- B: (2, 0)
- D: (x, y) with x² + y² = 49
- C: (p, q)

Midpoint M of BC is ((2 + p)/2, q/2). Now, angle bisectors from angles at A and D both pass through M.

So, the angle bisector of angle DAB passes through M, and the angle bisector of angle ADC also passes through M.

First, let me handle the angle bisector of angle DAB.

At point A, angle DAB is between sides AD and AB. The angle bisector will go from A through some point, but in this case, it goes through M. So, line AM is the angle bisector.

Similarly, at point D, angle ADC is between sides DC and DA. The angle bisector from D will go through M as well.

Therefore, line DM is the angle bisector of angle ADC.

So, now I have two lines: AM and DM, both passing through M.

Since M is the midpoint of BC, perhaps I can relate the coordinates accordingly.

Let me write the equation of line AM. Since it goes from A(0,0) to M((2 + p)/2, q/2). So, the parametric equations can be written as:

x = t*( (2 + p)/2 ), y = t*( q/2 ), where t varies from 0 to 1.

Similarly, the direction vector of AM is ((2 + p)/2, q/2). So, the slope of AM is (q/2) / ((2 + p)/2) = q / (2 + p).

Similarly, line DM goes from D(x, y) to M((2 + p)/2, q/2). The direction vector is ((2 + p)/2 - x, q/2 - y). So, the slope of DM is (q/2 - y) / ( (2 + p)/2 - x ).

But these slopes correspond to angle bisectors. So, perhaps I can use the angle bisector formula in coordinate geometry.

Wait, another thought: since AM is the angle bisector of angle DAB, which is at A, by the angle bisector theorem, the ratio of AB to AD is equal to the ratio of BM to MC.

Wait, yes! That seems useful.

In triangle ABC, the angle bisector from A would divide BC into segments proportional to AB and AC. But wait, in our case, it's not exactly triangle ABC because D is involved.

Wait, perhaps considering triangle ABD or something else.

Wait, no, let me clarify. In triangle ABD, angle at A is being bisected by AM. But AM connects A to M, which is the midpoint of BC. Hmm, that might complicate things.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to use vector methods or the angle bisector length formula.

Wait, hold on. The angle bisector theorem states that the angle bisector in a triangle divides the opposite side into segments proportional to the adjacent sides.

But in this quadrilateral, since we have two angle bisectors meeting at M, perhaps each bisector divides the opposite side in a certain ratio.

Wait, actually, in this case, for angle DAB, the bisector is AM, which intersects BC at its midpoint M. So, according to the angle bisector theorem, the ratio AB/AD should be equal to BM/MC.

But wait, M is the midpoint, so BM = MC, which would imply that AB/AD = 1. But AB is 2, AD is 7, so 2/7 = 1? That doesn't make sense. So, something is wrong here.

Wait, perhaps my understanding is flawed.

Wait, in triangle ABD, AM is the angle bisector of angle DAB, but does it intersect BD or BC?

Wait, in the quadrilateral, AM is connecting A to M, which is the midpoint of BC, so it's not necessarily intersecting BD or anything else.

Hmm, maybe the angle bisector theorem isn't directly applicable here because we aren't in a triangle.

This is getting confusing. Maybe I should approach this differently.

Another idea: since M is the midpoint of BC, perhaps we can assign coordinates such that BC is symmetric around M, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I can use the concept of mass point geometry or barycentric coordinates, but I'm not too familiar with that.

Alternatively, maybe using vectors.

Let me try vectors. Let me define vectors for points A, B, C, D.

Let me denote vectors as follows:

- Vector A is at (0, 0)
- Vector B is at (2, 0)
- Vector D is at (x, y)
- Vector C is at (p, q)

Midpoint M of BC is ((2 + p)/2, q/2).

Now, the angle bisector from A to M implies that the vector AM is the angle bisector of angle DAB.

Similarly, the angle bisector from D to M is the angle bisector of angle ADC.

In vector terms, the angle bisector condition can be translated into certain ratios.

Wait, perhaps using the formula for internal angle bisector in vectors.

The angle bisector between two vectors u and v is given by a vector proportional to |v|u + |u|v.

So, for angle DAB at point A, between vectors AB and AD.

Vector AB is (2, 0), vector AD is (x, y).

The angle bisector direction would be proportional to |AD|*AB + |AB|*AD.

Compute |AD|: sqrt(x² + y²) = 7

|AB|: sqrt(2² + 0²) = 2

So, the direction vector of the bisector is 7*(2, 0) + 2*(x, y) = (14 + 2x, 0 + 2y)

Therefore, the bisector line from A has direction vector (14 + 2x, 2y). Since it passes through A(0,0), the parametric equation is t*(14 + 2x, 2y).

But this bisector also passes through M((2 + p)/2, q/2). Therefore, there exists some scalar t such that:

t*(14 + 2x) = (2 + p)/2

t*(2y) = q/2

From the second equation: t = q/(4y)

Substitute into the first equation:

(q/(4y))*(14 + 2x) = (2 + p)/2

Multiply both sides by 4y:

q*(14 + 2x) = 2y*(2 + p)

Simplify:

14q + 2xq = 4y + 2yp

Divide both sides by 2:

7q + xq = 2y + yp

So, equation (1): xq + 7q - yp - 2y = 0

Similarly, now consider the angle bisector from D.

Angle ADC at point D is between vectors DC and DA.

Vector DC is (p - x, q - y), vector DA is (-x, -y).

The angle bisector direction would be proportional to |DC|*DA + |DA|*DC

Compute |DC|: sqrt( (p - x)^2 + (q - y)^2 ) = CD = 3

|DA|: sqrt(x² + y²) = 7

So, the direction vector is 3*(-x, -y) + 7*(p - x, q - y) = (-3x -7x +7p, -3y -7y +7q) = (-10x +7p, -10y +7q)

So, the direction vector is (-10x +7p, -10y +7q). Since the bisector passes through D(x, y) and M((2 + p)/2, q/2), the vector from D to M is ((2 + p)/2 - x, q/2 - y)

Which should be parallel to the direction vector (-10x +7p, -10y +7q)

Therefore, there exists some scalar k such that:

((2 + p)/2 - x, q/2 - y) = k*(-10x +7p, -10y +7q)

Thus, two equations:

(2 + p)/2 - x = k*(-10x +7p) ... (2)

q/2 - y = k*(-10y +7q) ... (3)

So, now we have equations (1), (2), and (3). Plus, we know that CD = 3, so:

(p - x)^2 + (q - y)^2 = 9 ... (4)

Also, AD = 7, so x² + y² = 49 ... (5)

And AB = 2, which is already considered by placing B at (2,0).

So, now we have five equations: (1), (2), (3), (4), (5). Variables are x, y, p, q, k.

This seems quite complicated, but maybe we can solve step by step.

First, from equation (5): x² + y² = 49.

Equation (4): (p - x)^2 + (q - y)^2 = 9.

Let me expand equation (4):

p² - 2px + x² + q² - 2qy + y² = 9

Using equation (5): x² + y² = 49, substitute:

p² - 2px + 49 + q² - 2qy = 9

Thus,

p² + q² - 2px - 2qy + 49 = 9

Simplify:

p² + q² - 2px - 2qy = -40 ... (6)

Equation (1): xq + 7q - yp - 2y = 0

Equation (2): (2 + p)/2 - x = k*(-10x +7p)

Equation (3): q/2 - y = k*(-10y +7q)

So, equations (2) and (3) can be used to find k in terms of p, q, x, y, and then relate them.

Let me denote equation (2):

(2 + p)/2 - x = k*(-10x +7p)

Multiply both sides by 2:

2 + p - 2x = k*(-20x +14p)

Similarly, equation (3):

q/2 - y = k*(-10y +7q)

Multiply both sides by 2:

q - 2y = k*(-20y +14q)

So now, equations (2) and (3) become:

2 + p - 2x = k*(-20x +14p) ... (2a)

q - 2y = k*(-20y +14q) ... (3a)

Now, from (2a) and (3a), we can express k from both and equate them.

From (2a):

k = (2 + p - 2x)/(-20x +14p)

From (3a):

k = (q - 2y)/(-20y +14q)

Set them equal:

(2 + p - 2x)/(-20x +14p) = (q - 2y)/(-20y +14q)

Cross-multiplying:

(2 + p - 2x)*(-20y +14q) = (q - 2y)*(-20x +14p)

Let me compute both sides.

Left side:

(2 + p - 2x)*(-20y +14q)

Expand:

2*(-20y +14q) + p*(-20y +14q) - 2x*(-20y +14q)

= -40y + 28q -20py +14pq +40xy -28xq

Right side:

(q - 2y)*(-20x +14p)

Expand:

q*(-20x +14p) -2y*(-20x +14p)

= -20xq +14pq +40xy -28yp

So, setting left side equal to right side:

-40y + 28q -20py +14pq +40xy -28xq = -20xq +14pq +40xy -28yp

Simplify both sides:

Left side:
-40y +28q -20py +14pq +40xy -28xq

Right side:
-20xq +14pq +40xy -28yp

Subtract right side from both sides:

(-40y +28q -20py +14pq +40xy -28xq) - (-20xq +14pq +40xy -28yp) = 0

Compute term by term:

-40y - (-28yp) = -40y +28yp

+28q remains

-20py remains

+14pq -14pq cancels

+40xy -40xy cancels

-28xq - (-20xq) = -28xq +20xq = -8xq

So overall:

-40y +28yp +28q -20py -8xq = 0

Factor terms:

Looking at terms with y:

-40y +28yp -20py = -40y + (28p -20p)y = -40y +8py

Terms with q:

28q

Terms with xq:

-8xq

So:

(-40y +8py) +28q -8xq = 0

Factor:

y*(-40 +8p) + q*(28 -8x) = 0

So,

y*(8p -40) + q*(28 -8x) = 0

Divide through by 4:

y*(2p -10) + q*(7 -2x) = 0

So,

2y(p -5) + q(7 -2x) = 0 ... (7)

Now, equation (7) is a new relation among variables.

Recall equation (1):

xq +7q -yp -2y =0

We can write equation (1) as:

q(x +7) - y(p +2) =0 ... (1a)

So, equation (1a): q(x +7) = y(p +2)

Equation (7): 2y(p -5) + q(7 -2x) =0

Let me express q from equation (1a):

q = [ y(p +2) ] / (x +7 )

Plug this into equation (7):

2y(p -5) + [ y(p +2)/(x +7) ]*(7 -2x) =0

Factor out y:

y[ 2(p -5) + (p +2)(7 -2x)/(x +7) ] =0

Assuming y ≠0 (since otherwise, if y=0, point D would be on AB, making ABCD degenerate, which contradicts convexity), so the expression inside brackets must be zero:

2(p -5) + (p +2)(7 -2x)/(x +7) =0

Multiply through by (x +7) to eliminate denominator:

2(p -5)(x +7) + (p +2)(7 -2x) =0

Expand both terms:

First term: 2(p -5)(x +7) = 2p x +14p -10x -70

Second term: (p +2)(7 -2x) =7p -2p x +14 -4x

Combine all terms:

2p x +14p -10x -70 +7p -2p x +14 -4x =0

Simplify:

2p x -2p x cancels

14p +7p =21p

-10x -4x =-14x

-70 +14 =-56

So,

21p -14x -56 =0

Divide both sides by 7:

3p -2x -8 =0

So,

3p =2x +8

Hence,

p = (2x +8)/3 ... (8)

So, we have p expressed in terms of x.

Now, remember equation (5): x² + y² =49

Equation (6): p² + q² -2px -2qy = -40

Equation (1a): q = y(p +2)/(x +7 )

Equation (7): 2y(p -5) + q(7 -2x)=0, but we already used that.

So, let me plug p from (8) into other equations.

First, from equation (8): p=(2x +8)/3

So, let's compute p +2:

p +2 = (2x +8)/3 +2 = (2x +8 +6)/3 = (2x +14)/3

Similarly, x +7 remains as is.

So, from equation (1a):

q = y*(2x +14)/3 / (x +7 ) = y*(2x +14)/(3(x +7))

Simplify numerator: 2x +14 =2(x +7)

So, q = y*(2(x +7))/(3(x +7)) )= (2y)/3

Therefore, q = (2y)/3 ... (9)

Great, so q is expressed in terms of y.

So, now, from equation (8): p=(2x +8)/3

From equation (9): q=(2y)/3

So, now we can express p and q in terms of x and y.

Now, plug p and q into equation (6):

p² + q² -2px -2qy = -40

Express p and q:

p = (2x +8)/3

q = (2y)/3

Compute p²:

[(2x +8)/3]^2 = (4x² +32x +64)/9

Compute q²:

(4y²)/9

Compute 2px:

2*( (2x +8)/3 )*x = (4x² +16x)/3

Compute 2qy:

2*(2y)/3 * y = (4y²)/3

So, plugging into equation (6):

(4x² +32x +64)/9 + (4y²)/9 - (4x² +16x)/3 - (4y²)/3 = -40

Multiply every term by 9 to eliminate denominators:

4x² +32x +64 +4y² - (4x² +16x)*3 - (4y²)*3 = -360

Compute each multiplication:

(4x² +32x +64) + (4y²) -12x² -48x -12y² = -360

Combine like terms:

4x² -12x² = -8x²

32x -48x = -16x

64 remains

4y² -12y² = -8y²

So,

-8x² -16x +64 -8y² = -360

Bring all terms to left side:

-8x² -16x +64 -8y² +360 =0

Simplify constants:

64 +360 =424

So,

-8x² -16x -8y² +424 =0

Divide entire equation by -8:

x² +2x +y² -53=0

So,

x² + y² +2x -53=0 ... (10)

But from equation (5): x² + y² =49

Substitute into equation (10):

49 +2x -53 =0 => 2x -4=0 => 2x=4 => x=2

So, x=2.

Then, from equation (5): x² + y²=49 => 4 + y²=49 => y²=45 => y=±3√5

But since the quadrilateral is convex, and assuming standard orientation, probably y>0, so y=3√5.

So, point D is at (2, 3√5).

Then, from equation (8): p=(2x +8)/3=(4 +8)/3=12/3=4

From equation (9): q=(2y)/3=(6√5)/3=2√5

So, point C is at (4, 2√5)

Therefore, coordinates:

A(0,0); B(2,0); D(2,3√5); C(4,2√5)

Now, we can compute the area of quadrilateral ABCD.

To compute the area, we can use the shoelace formula.

Coordinates in order: A(0,0); B(2,0); C(4,2√5); D(2,3√5); back to A(0,0)

Shoelace formula:

Area = 1/2 |sum_{i=1 to n} (x_i y_{i+1} - x_{i+1} y_i)|

Compute each term:

From A to B: (0,0) to (2,0):

Term: 0*0 - 2*0 =0

From B to C: (2,0) to (4,2√5):

Term: 2*(2√5) -4*0=4√5

From C to D: (4,2√5) to (2,3√5):

Term:4*(3√5) -2*(2√5)=12√5 -4√5=8√5

From D to A: (2,3√5) to (0,0):

Term:2*0 -0*(3√5)=0

Sum of terms:0 +4√5 +8√5 +0=12√5

Area=1/2 * |12√5|=6√5

Hence, the area is 6√5, so square of the area is (6√5)^2=36*5=180.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{180}
</think>

Given a convex quadrilateral \(ABCD\) with \(AB = 2\), \(AD = 7\), and \(CD = 3\), where the bisectors of the acute angles \(\angle DAB\) and \(\angle ADC\) intersect at the midpoint \(M\) of \(\overline{BC}\). We need to find the square of the area of \(ABCD\).

1. **Assigning Coordinates:**
   - Place \(A\) at \((0, 0)\), \(B\) at \((2, 0)\), \(D\) at \((x, y)\) with \(x^2 + y^2 = 49\), and \(C\) at \((p, q)\).
   - Midpoint \(M\) of \(\overline{BC}\) is \(\left(\frac{2 + p}{2}, \frac{q}{2}\right)\).

2. **Using Angle Bisector Theorem:**
   - The angle bisector of \(\angle DAB\) passes through \(M\), leading to the direction vector analysis.
   - The angle bisector of \(\angle ADC\) also passes through \(M\), leading to another direction vector analysis.

3. **Setting Up Equations:**
   - Using the angle bisector properties and solving the resulting equations, we find:
     - \(p = \frac{2x + 8}{3}\)
     - \(q = \frac{2y}{3}\)
   - Substituting these into the equations, we solve for \(x\) and \(y\):
     - \(x = 2\)
     - \(y = 3\sqrt{5}\)
   - Thus, \(D\) is at \((2, 3\sqrt{5})\) and \(C\) is at \((4, 2\sqrt{5})\).

4. **Calculating the Area:**
   - Using the shoelace formula with coordinates \(A(0, 0)\), \(B(2, 0)\), \(C(4, 2\sqrt{5})\), \(D(2, 3\sqrt{5})\):
     - The area is calculated as \(6\sqrt{5}\).
   - Squaring the area gives \((6\sqrt{5})^2 = 180\).

Thus, the square of the area of \(ABCD\) is \(\boxed{180}\).
