 The problem: 
Let $S$ be the set of all rational numbers that can be expressed as a repeating decimal in the form $0.\overline{abcd},$ where at least one of the digits $a,$ $b,$ $c,$ or $d$ is nonzero. Let $N$ be the number of distinct numerators obtained when numbers in $S$ are written as fractions in lowest terms. For example, both $4$ and $410$ are counted among the distinct numerators for numbers in $S$ because $0.\overline{3636} = \frac{4}{11}$ and $0.\overline{1230} = \frac{410}{3333}.$ Find the remainder when $N$ is divided by $1000.$


To solve the problem, we first need to understand the structure of the repeating decimals of the form \(0.\overline{abcd}\). A repeating decimal \(0.\overline{abcd}\) can be expressed as a fraction:

\[
0.\overline{abcd} = \frac{abcd}{9999}
\]

where \(abcd\) is a four-digit number (from 0000 to 9999) and \(abcd \neq 0000\). This means the numerator of the fraction is any integer from 1 to 9999. However, we need to consider the fractions in their lowest terms. The number of distinct numerators in the lowest terms is the same as the number of integers from 1 to 9999 that are relatively prime to 9999.

The number 9999 factors into primes as follows:

\[
9999 = 3^2 \times 11 \times 101
\]

We use Euler's totient function \(\phi(n)\) to find the number of integers up to 9999 that are relatively prime to 9999. The totient function is defined as:

\[
\phi(9999) = 9999 \left(1 - \frac{1}{3}\right) \left(1 - \frac{1}{11}\right) \left(1 - \frac{1}{101}\right)
\]

Calculating this, we get:

\[
\phi(9999) = 9999 \times \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{10}{11} \times \frac{100}{101} = 9999 \times \frac{2000}{3333} = 6000
\]

Thus, there are 6000 integers from 1 to 9999 that are relatively prime to 9999. Therefore, the number of distinct numerators obtained when numbers in \(S\) are written as fractions in lowest terms is 6000. We need to find the remainder when 6000 is divided by 1000:

\[
6000 \mod 1000 = 0
\]

So, the remainder when \(N\) is divided by 1000 is:

\[
\boxed{0}
\]
