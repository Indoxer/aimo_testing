 The problem: 
Let $S$ be the set of all rational numbers that can be expressed as a repeating decimal in the form $0.\overline{abcd},$ where at least one of the digits $a,$ $b,$ $c,$ or $d$ is nonzero. Let $N$ be the number of distinct numerators obtained when numbers in $S$ are written as fractions in lowest terms. For example, both $4$ and $410$ are counted among the distinct numerators for numbers in $S$ because $0.\overline{3636} = \frac{4}{11}$ and $0.\overline{1230} = \frac{410}{3333}.$ Find the remainder when $N$ is divided by $1000.$


To solve the problem, we first need to understand the structure of the repeating decimals in the set \( S \). A repeating decimal of the form \( 0.\overline{abcd} \) can be expressed as a fraction. Specifically, if we let \( x = 0.\overline{abcd} \), then

\[
x = \frac{abcd}{9999},
\]

where \( abcd \) represents the four-digit number formed by the digits \( a, b, c, \) and \( d \). Since \( abcd \) is a four-digit number, it can range from 0000 to 9999, but we are only interested in the cases where at least one of the digits is nonzero, which means we exclude 0000. Therefore, \( abcd \) can take any value from 1 to 9999.

Next, we need to determine how many distinct numerators we get when these fractions are in their lowest terms. This involves finding the number of distinct numerators after reducing each fraction \( \frac{abcd}{9999} \) to its lowest terms. The number 9999 can be factored as:

\[
9999 = 3^2 \times 11 \times 101.
\]

For a fraction \( \frac{abcd}{9999} \) to be in its lowest terms, \( abcd \) must not share any prime factors with 9999, i.e., \( abcd \) must not be divisible by 3, 11, or 101. We will use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to count the number of such \( abcd \).

First, we count the total number of four-digit numbers, which is 9999. Next, we subtract the number of four-digit numbers that are divisible by 3, 11, or 101.

The number of four-digit multiples of 3 is:

\[
\left\lfloor \frac{9999}{3} \right\rfloor - \left\lfloor \frac{0000}{3} \right\rfloor = 3333.
\]

The number of four-digit multiples of 11 is:

\[
\left\lfloor \frac{9999}{11} \right\rfloor - \left\lfloor \frac{0000}{11} \right\rfloor = 909.
\]

The number of four-digit multiples of 101 is:

\[
\left\lfloor \frac{9999}{101} \right\rfloor - \left\lfloor \frac{0000}{101} \right\rfloor = 99.
\]

The number of four-digit multiples of \( 3 \times 11 = 33 \) is:

\[
\left\lfloor \frac{9999}{33} \right\rfloor - \left\lfloor \frac{0000}{33} \right\rfloor = 303.
\]

The number of four-digit multiples of \( 3 \times 101 = 303 \) is:

\[
\left\lfloor \frac{9999}{303} \right\rfloor - \left\lfloor \frac{0000}{303} \right\rfloor = 33.
\]

The number of four-digit multiples of \( 11 \times 101 = 1111 \) is:

\[
\left\lfloor \frac{9999}{1111} \right\rfloor - \left\lfloor \frac{0000}{1111} \right\rfloor = 9.
\]

The number of four-digit multiples of \( 3 \times 11 \times 101 = 3333 \) is:

\[
\left\lfloor \frac{9999}{3333} \right\rfloor - \left\lfloor \frac{0000}{3333} \right\rfloor = 3.
\]

By the principle of inclusion-exclusion, the number of four-digit numbers that are divisible by 3, 11, or 101 is:

\[
3333 + 909 + 99 - 303 - 33 - 9 + 3 = 3996.
\]

Therefore, the number of four-digit numbers that are not divisible by 3, 11, or 101 is:

\[
9999 - 3996 = 6003.
\]

Thus, the number of distinct numerators obtained when numbers in \( S \) are written as fractions in lowest terms is 6003. The remainder when 6003 is divided by 1000 is:

\[
\boxed{003}.
\]
