 The problem: 
Three spheres with radii $11$, $13$, and $19$ are mutually externally tangent. A plane intersects the spheres in three congruent circles centered at $A$, $B$, and $C$, respectively, and the centers of the spheres all lie on the same side of this plane. Suppose that $AB^2 = 560$. Find $AC^2$.


To solve the problem, we start by understanding the geometric configuration of the spheres and the plane. The centers of the spheres are denoted as \(O_1\), \(O_2\), and \(O_3\) with radii 11, 13, and 19, respectively. The plane intersects the spheres in three congruent circles centered at points \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\). The distance between the centers of the spheres is given by the sum of their radii since they are mutually externally tangent.

First, we calculate the distances between the centers of the spheres:
\[
O_1O_2 = 11 + 13 = 24,
\]
\[
O_2O_3 = 13 + 19 = 32,
\]
\[
O_3O_1 = 19 + 11 = 30.
\]

The plane intersects the spheres in congruent circles, so the distances from the centers of the spheres to the plane are proportional to the radii of the spheres minus the radius of the circle formed by the intersection. Let the distance from \(O_1\) to the plane be \(d_1\), from \(O_2\) to the plane be \(d_2\), and from \(O_3\) to the plane be \(d_3\). Since the circles are congruent, the distances from the centers to the plane are proportional to the radii of the spheres. Therefore, we have:
\[
d_1 : d_2 : d_3 = 11 : 13 : 19.
\]

Let \(d_1 = 11k\), \(d_2 = 13k\), and \(d_3 = 19k\) for some constant \(k\). The distance between the centers of the spheres can also be expressed in terms of these distances and the radii of the circles formed by the intersections. Specifically, the distance between the centers of the spheres is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs equal to the distance between the centers of the spheres minus the diameter of the circle formed by the intersection.

Given that \(AB^2 = 560\), we can use the fact that the distance between the centers of the spheres \(O_1\) and \(O_2\) is 24, and the distance between the centers of the spheres \(O_2\) and \(O_3\) is 32. The distance between the centers of the spheres \(O_1\) and \(O_3\) is 30. The distance between the centers of the spheres is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs equal to the distance between the centers of the spheres minus the diameter of the circle formed by the intersection.

Using the Pythagorean theorem in the plane perpendicular to the line connecting the centers of the spheres, we have:
\[
(11k)^2 + (13k)^2 - 2 \cdot 11k \cdot 13k \cdot \cos(\theta) = 24^2,
\]
\[
(13k)^2 + (19k)^2 - 2 \cdot 13k \cdot 19k \cdot \cos(\phi) = 32^2,
\]
\[
(19k)^2 + (11k)^2 - 2 \cdot 19k \cdot 11k \cdot \cos(\psi) = 30^2.
\]

Since the circles are congruent, the distances from the centers of the spheres to the plane are proportional to the radii of the spheres. Therefore, we can use the fact that the distance between the centers of the spheres is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs equal to the distance between the centers of the spheres minus the diameter of the circle formed by the intersection.

Finally, we need to find \(AC^2\). Using the same method as above, we have:
\[
AC^2 = (11k)^2 + (19k)^2 - 2 \cdot 11k \cdot 19k \cdot \cos(\omega).
\]

Since the circles are congruent, the distance between the centers of the spheres is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs equal to the distance between the centers of the spheres minus the diameter of the circle formed by the intersection. Therefore, we have:
\[
AC^2 = 560 + 19^2 - 2 \cdot 19 \cdot 11 \cdot \cos(\omega) = 560 + 361 - 418 = 503.
\]

Thus, the value of \(AC^2\) is:
\[
\boxed{704}.
\]```
The final answer is \(\boxed{704}\).
