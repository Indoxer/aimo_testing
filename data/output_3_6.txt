 The problem: 
For any finite set $X$, let $| X |$ denote the number of elements in $X$. Define
\[S_n = \sum | A \cap B | ,\]
where the sum is taken over all ordered pairs $(A, B)$ such that $A$ and $B$ are subsets of $\left\{ 1 , 2 , 3,  \cdots , n \right\}$ with $|A| = |B|$.
For example, $S_2 = 4$ because the sum is taken over the pairs of subsets
\[(A, B) \in \left\{ (\emptyset, \emptyset) , ( \{1\} , \{1\} ), ( \{1\} , \{2\} ) , ( \{2\} , \{1\} ) , ( \{2\} , \{2\} ) , ( \{1 , 2\} , \{1 , 2\} ) \right\} ,\]
giving $S_2 = 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 2 = 4$.
Let $\frac{S_{2022}}{S_{2021}} = \frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find the remainder when $p + q$ is divided by
1000.


To solve for \( S_n \), we need to understand the contribution of each element \( i \) from the set \(\{1, 2, \ldots, n\}\) to the sum \( S_n \). Specifically, we need to count how many times each element \( i \) appears in the intersection of two subsets \( A \) and \( B \) of the same size.

Consider a fixed element \( i \). For \( S_n \) to include the term \( i \), \( i \) must be in both subsets \( A \) and \( B \). If \( A \) and \( B \) are subsets of \(\{1, 2, \ldots, n\}\) with \( |A| = |B| = k \), then there are \(\binom{n-1}{k-1}\) ways to choose the remaining elements of \( A \) and \( B \) from the remaining \( n-1 \) elements. Therefore, there are \(\binom{n-1}{k-1}^2\) pairs \((A, B)\) such that \( i \in A \cap B \).

Summing over all possible values of \( k \) from 0 to \( n \), we get:
\[
S_n = \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k} \binom{n}{k} k = \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k}^2 k.
\]

Using the identity \(\sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k}^2 k = n \cdot 2^{n-2} \sum_{k=1}^n \binom{n-1}{k-1} = n \cdot 2^{n-2} \cdot 2^{n-1} = n \cdot 2^{2n-3}\), we have:
\[
S_n = n \cdot 2^{2n-3}.
\]

Thus, for \( n = 2022 \) and \( n = 2021 \), we have:
\[
S_{2022} = 2022 \cdot 2^{4041}, \quad S_{2021} = 2021 \cdot 2^{4040}.
\]

Therefore,
\[
\frac{S_{2022}}{S_{2021}} = \frac{2022 \cdot 2^{4041}}{2021 \cdot 2^{4040}} = \frac{2022 \cdot 2}{2021} = \frac{4044}{2021}.
\]

Since 4044 and 2021 are relatively prime, we have \( p = 4044 \) and \( q = 2021 \). Thus, \( p + q = 4044 + 2021 = 6065 \), and the remainder when 6065 is divided by 1000 is:
\[
6065 \mod 1000 = 65.
\]

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{65}.
\]
