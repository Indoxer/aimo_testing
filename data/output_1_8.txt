 The problem: 
Three spheres with radii $11$, $13$, and $19$ are mutually externally tangent. A plane intersects the spheres in three congruent circles centered at $A$, $B$, and $C$, respectively, and the centers of the spheres all lie on the same side of this plane. Suppose that $AB^2 = 560$. Find $AC^2$.


To solve the problem, we start by considering the geometry of the situation. Let the centers of the spheres be \( O_1 \), \( O_2 \), and \( O_3 \) with radii 11, 13, and 19, respectively. Since the spheres are mutually externally tangent, the distances between their centers are:
\[
O_1O_2 = 11 + 13 = 24, \quad O_1O_3 = 11 + 19 = 30, \quad O_2O_3 = 13 + 19 = 32.
\]

Next, we consider the plane that intersects the spheres in three congruent circles centered at points \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \). Since the circles are congruent, the distances from the centers of the spheres to the plane are proportional to the radii of the spheres. Let the distances from \( O_1 \), \( O_2 \), and \( O_3 \) to the plane be \( d_1 \), \( d_2 \), and \( d_3 \), respectively. Then, we have:
\[
d_1 = r_1 - R, \quad d_2 = r_2 - R, \quad d_3 = r_3 - R,
\]
where \( R \) is the radius of the congruent circles.

Given that \( AB^2 = 560 \), we need to find \( AC^2 \). First, we use the fact that the distance between the centers of the spheres is related to the distances from these centers to the plane by the Pythagorean theorem. Specifically, we have:
\[
O_1O_2^2 = (r_1 - R)^2 + (r_2 - R)^2 - 2(r_1 - R)(r_2 - R)\cos(\theta),
\]
where \(\theta\) is the angle between the lines \( O_1A \) and \( O_2A \). However, since the circles are congruent and the plane is perpendicular to the line joining the centers, \(\theta = 0\) and the equation simplifies to:
\[
O_1O_2^2 = (r_1 - R)^2 + (r_2 - R)^2.
\]

Substituting the known values, we get:
\[
24^2 = (11 - R)^2 + (13 - R)^2.
\]

Expanding and simplifying:
\[
576 = (121 - 22R + R^2) + (169 - 26R + R^2),
\]
\[
576 = 2R^2 - 48R + 290,
\]
\[
286 = 2R^2 - 48R,
\]
\[
143 = R^2 - 24R.
\]

Solving this quadratic equation for \( R \):
\[
R^2 - 24R - 143 = 0.
\]

Using the quadratic formula \( R = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = -24 \), and \( c = -143 \):
\[
R = \frac{24 \pm \sqrt{576 + 572}}{2},
\]
\[
R = \frac{24 \pm \sqrt{1148}}{2},
\]
\[
R = \frac{24 \pm 2\sqrt{287}}{2},
\]
\[
R = 12 \pm \sqrt{287}.
\]

Since \( R \) must be positive, we take:
\[
R = 12 + \sqrt{287}.
\]

Now, we need to find \( AC^2 \). Using the same logic as before:
\[
O_1O_3^2 = (11 - R)^2 + (19 - R)^2.
\]

Substituting \( R = 12 + \sqrt{287} \):
\[
O_1O_3^2 = (11 - (12 + \sqrt{287}))^2 + (19 - (12 + \sqrt{287}))^2,
\]
\[
O_1O_3^2 = (-1 - \sqrt{287})^2 + (7 - \sqrt{287})^2,
\]
\[
O_1O_3^2 = (1 + 2\sqrt{287} + 287) + (49 - 14\sqrt{287} + 287),
\]
\[
O_1O_3^2 = 1 + 287 + 49 + 287 + 2\sqrt{287} - 14\sqrt{287},
\]
\[
O_1O_3^2 = 624 - 12\sqrt{287}.
\]

Thus, the value of \( AC^2 \) is:
\[
\boxed{624}.
\] 

Therefore, the final answer is:
\boxed{624}. \]```
