 The problem: 
Three spheres with radii $11$, $13$, and $19$ are mutually externally tangent. A plane intersects the spheres in three congruent circles centered at $A$, $B$, and $C$, respectively, and the centers of the spheres all lie on the same side of this plane. Suppose that $AB^2 = 560$. Find $AC^2$.


To solve for \(AC^2\), we start by understanding the geometric configuration of the problem. We have three spheres with radii 11, 13, and 19 that are mutually externally tangent. A plane intersects these spheres in three congruent circles centered at points \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\) respectively, and the centers of the spheres all lie on the same side of this plane. We are given that \(AB^2 = 560\), and we need to find \(AC^2\).

First, let's denote the centers of the spheres as \(O_1\), \(O_2\), and \(O_3\) with radii 11, 13, and 19 respectively. The distance between the centers of any two spheres is the sum of their radii. Therefore, we have:
\[
O_1O_2 = 11 + 13 = 24, \quad O_1O_3 = 11 + 19 = 30, \quad O_2O_3 = 13 + 19 = 32.
\]

Since the plane intersects the spheres in congruent circles, the distances from the centers of the spheres to the plane are proportional to the radii of the spheres minus the radius of the circle of intersection. Let the distances from \(O_1\), \(O_2\), and \(O_3\) to the plane be \(d_1\), \(d_2\), and \(d_3\) respectively. Then, we have:
\[
d_1 = r_1 - r_A, \quad d_2 = r_2 - r_B, \quad d_3 = r_3 - r_C,
\]
where \(r_A\), \(r_B\), and \(r_C\) are the radii of the circles of intersection, which are equal because the circles are congruent. Therefore, we can write:
\[
d_1^2 + r_A^2 = 11^2 = 121, \quad d_2^2 + r_A^2 = 13^2 = 169, \quad d_3^2 + r_A^2 = 19^2 = 361.
\]

From these equations, we can express \(d_1^2\), \(d_2^2\), and \(d_3^2\) in terms of \(r_A^2\):
\[
d_1^2 = 121 - r_A^2, \quad d_2^2 = 169 - r_A^2, \quad d_3^2 = 361 - r_A^2.
\]

The distance between the centers of the spheres \(O_1\) and \(O_2\) can also be expressed in terms of \(d_1\), \(d_2\), and the distance between the centers of the circles of intersection \(A\) and \(B\). Since the circles are congruent, the distance \(AB\) is the same as the distance between the centers of the circles of intersection, which is \(2\sqrt{r_A^2}\). Therefore, we have:
\[
AB^2 = (d_1 - d_2)^2 + (2r_A)^2 = 560.
\]

Substituting the expressions for \(d_1^2\) and \(d_2^2\), we get:
\[
(d_1 - d_2)^2 + 4r_A^2 = 560.
\]
Expanding and substituting \(d_1^2\) and \(d_2^2\), we have:
\[
(121 - r_A^2) + (169 - r_A^2) - 2d_1d_2 + 4r_A^2 = 560,
\]
\[
290 - 2d_1d_2 + 2r_A^2 = 560,
\]
\[
-2d_1d_2 + 2r_A^2 = 270,
\]
\[
-d_1d_2 + r_A^2 = 135.
\]

Now, we need to find \(AC^2\). Using a similar approach, we have:
\[
AC^2 = (d_1 - d_3)^2 + (2r_A)^2.
\]
Substituting the expressions for \(d_1^2\) and \(d_3^2\), we get:
\[
(d_1 - d_3)^2 + 4r_A^2.
\]
Expanding and substituting \(d_1^2\) and \(d_3^2\), we have:
\[
(121 - r_A^2) + (361 - r_A^2) - 2d_1d_3 + 4r_A^2,
\]
\[
482 - 2d_1d_3 + 2r_A^2.
\]

We need to find \(d_1d_3\). Using the fact that the distance between the centers of the spheres \(O_1\) and \(O_3\) is 30, we have:
\[
d_1^2 + d_3^2 - 2d_1d_3 = 900.
\]
Substituting \(d_1^2 = 121 - r_A^2\) and \(d_3^2 = 361 - r_A^2\), we get:
\[
(121 - r_A^2) + (361 - r_A^2) - 2d_1d_3 = 900,
\]
\[
482 - 2r_A^2 - 2d_1d_3 = 900,
\]
\[
-2r_A^2 - 2d_1d_3 = 418,
\]
\[
-r_A^2 - d_1d_3 = 209,
\]
\[
d_1d_3 = -r_A^2 - 209.
\]

Substituting \(d_1d_3\) back into the expression for \(AC^2\), we get:
\[
AC^2 = 482 - 2(-r_A^2 - 209) + 2r_A^2,
\]
\[
AC^2 = 482 + 2r_A^2 + 418 + 2r_A^2,
\]
\[
AC^2 = 900.
\]

Therefore, the value of \(AC^2\) is \(\boxed{900}\).
