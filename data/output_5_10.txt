 The problem: 
Given $\triangle ABC$ and a point $P$ on one of its sides, call line $\ell$ the $\textit{splitting line}$ of $\triangle ABC$ through $P$ if $\ell$ passes through $P$ and divides $\triangle ABC$ into two polygons of equal perimeter. Let $\triangle ABC$ be a triangle where $BC = 219$ and $AB$ and $AC$ are positive integers. Let $M$ and $N$ be the midpoints of $\overline{AB}$ and $\overline{AC},$ respectively, and suppose that the splitting lines of $\triangle ABC$ through $M$ and $N$ intersect at $30^\circ.$ Find the perimeter of $\triangle ABC.$


To solve the problem, we need to find the perimeter of triangle \(ABC\) given that the splitting lines through the midpoints \(M\) and \(N\) of sides \(AB\) and \(AC\) respectively intersect at an angle of \(30^\circ\). We start by noting that the splitting lines divide the perimeter of the triangle into two equal parts.

Let's denote the lengths of the sides of the triangle as follows:
- \(BC = a = 219\)
- \(AB = c\)
- \(AC = b\)

The midpoints \(M\) and \(N\) of sides \(AB\) and \(AC\) respectively imply that \(AM = MB = \frac{c}{2}\) and \(AN = NC = \frac{b}{2}\).

The key insight is that the angle between the splitting lines through \(M\) and \(N\) is \(30^\circ\). This implies that the angle between the medians of the triangle is \(30^\circ\), which is a specific geometric property of the triangle. For a triangle with such a property, it must be an equilateral triangle or a specific type of isosceles triangle. However, since \(BC = 219\) is fixed and \(AB\) and \(AC\) are integers, the triangle cannot be equilateral (since all sides would have to be equal, which is not possible here).

Instead, we consider the possibility that the triangle is isosceles with \(AB = AC\). In this case, the medians from \(B\) and \(C\) to the midpoint of \(AC\) and \(AB\) respectively are equal and intersect at \(30^\circ\). This configuration implies that the triangle is a right triangle with the right angle at \(A\).

For a right triangle with legs \(AB = AC = x\) and hypotenuse \(BC = 219\), we have:
\[x^2 + x^2 = 219^2 \implies 2x^2 = 219^2 \implies x^2 = \frac{219^2}{2} \implies x = \frac{219}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{219\sqrt{2}}{2}.\]
Since \(x\) must be an integer, this configuration is not possible. Instead, we need to consider the possibility that the triangle is isosceles with the angle at \(A\) being \(60^\circ\) (since the medians intersect at \(30^\circ\)).

For an isosceles triangle with \(AB = AC\) and the angle at \(A\) being \(60^\circ\), the triangle is actually equilateral. However, since \(BC = 219\) is fixed, the triangle cannot be equilateral. Instead, we consider the possibility that the triangle is isosceles with the angle at \(A\) being \(120^\circ\).

For an isosceles triangle with \(AB = AC\) and the angle at \(A\) being \(120^\circ\), we have:
\[AB = AC = x \quad \text{and} \quad BC = 219.\]
Using the Law of Cosines in \(\triangle ABC\):
\[219^2 = x^2 + x^2 - 2x^2 \cos(120^\circ) = 2x^2 + x^2 = 3x^2 \implies x^2 = \frac{219^2}{3} \implies x = \frac{219}{\sqrt{3}} = 73\sqrt{3}.\]
Since \(x\) must be an integer, this configuration is not possible either. Instead, we need to consider the possibility that the triangle is isosceles with the angle at \(A\) being \(90^\circ\).

For a right triangle with legs \(AB = AC = x\) and hypotenuse \(BC = 219\), we have:
\[x^2 + x^2 = 219^2 \implies 2x^2 = 219^2 \implies x^2 = \frac{219^2}{2} \implies x = \frac{219}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{219\sqrt{2}}{2}.\]
