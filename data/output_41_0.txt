 The problem: 
Alice knows that $3$ red cards and $3$ black cards will be revealed to her one at a time in random order. Before each card is revealed, Alice must guess its color. If Alice plays optimally, the expected number of cards she will guess correctly is $\frac{m}{n},$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n.$


Okay, so I need to figure out the expected number of correct guesses Alice can make when she has 3 red cards and 3 black cards revealed one at a time in random order. She gets to guess before each card is shown, and she wants to maximize the number of correct guesses on average.

Hmm, let's break this down. So there are 6 cards total, half red and half black. They're going to be shuffled randomly, so each permutation is equally likely. Alice is guessing each card's color one by one, and before each guess, she can choose whether to guess red or black based on what's left.

I remember that in problems like this, it's often useful to use dynamic programming or recursion because the optimal strategy depends on the current state of remaining cards. Maybe I can model this as a state where I know how many red and black cards are left, and then compute the expected value for each state.

Let me think about the states. Each state can be represented by the number of red cards remaining (r) and the number of black cards remaining (b). Since we start with 3 red and 3 black, our initial state is (3, 3). For each state, the next card could be either red or black, depending on the remaining counts.

In any given state, if there are more red cards left than black, the optimal strategy would be to guess red, since that gives a higher probability of being correct. Similarly, if there are more black cards left, guess black. If they're equal, it doesn't matter which you guess; the probability is 50-50.

So for each state (r, b), the expected number of correct guesses E(r, b) can be calculated based on the probabilities of drawing red or black, and then adding 1 if you guess correctly plus the expected value from the next state.

Wait, but actually, since you get to choose your guess based on the remaining cards, you don't have to guess randomly. Instead, you'll always guess the color that has more remaining. If they're equal, you can pick either, but it won't affect the expectation.

Therefore, for each state (r, b):

If r > b:
- Guess red. Probability of correct guess is r/(r + b).
- So, the expected value here is 1 * (r/(r + b)) + E(r - 1, b)
- Because if you guess correctly, you move to state (r - 1, b); if not, you stay in state (r, b) but have guessed incorrectly.

Similarly, if b > r:
- Guess black. Probability of correct guess is b/(r + b).
- Expected value: 1 * (b/(r + b)) + E(r, b - 1)

If r = b:
- Guess either (doesn't matter). Probability of correct is 0.5.
- So, expected value: 0.5 * 1 + 0.5 * 0 + E(r - 1, b - 1)
Wait, hold on, maybe that's not quite right.

Actually, when r = b, regardless of which color you guess, the probability of being correct is 0.5. But you still have to decide which color to guess, but since both are equal, it doesn't change anything. So, you can express it as:

E(r, b) = [prob_correct] * 1 + [prob_incorrect] * 0 + E(r', b') where r' and b' decrease by 1 if you were correct, otherwise remain the same?

Wait, no, actually, regardless of whether you're correct or not, the next state will have one less card of the color you guessed. So, perhaps, it's better to model it as:

E(r, b) = max(prob_red, prob_black) + E(r - 1, b) if r != b,

But wait, no. Let's think carefully.

At each state, you can choose to guess red or black. The expected value is the maximum over the two choices.

So, E(r, b) = max[ (r / (r + b)) * (1 + E(r - 1, b)) + ((b / (r + b)) * E(r, b - 1)),
                  (b / (r + b)) * (1 + E(r, b - 1)) + ((r / (r + b)) * E(r - 1, b)) ) ]

Wait, that might not be correct. Actually, if you choose to guess red, then with probability r/(r + b), you get a correct guess and move to (r - 1, b). With probability b/(r + b), you get an incorrect guess and stay at (r, b - 1). So the expected value if you guess red is:

( r / (r + b) ) * (1 + E(r - 1, b)) + ( b / (r + b) ) * E(r, b - 1 )

Similarly, if you choose to guess black, it's:

( b / (r + b) ) * (1 + E(r, b - 1 )) + ( r / (r + b) ) * E(r - 1, b )

Then, E(r, b) is the maximum of these two expressions.

Yes, that seems correct.

Therefore, we can write recursive equations:

E(r, b) = max [ ( r/(r+b) )*(1 + E(r-1,b)) + ( b/(r+b) )*E(r, b-1 ),
                ( b/(r+b) )*(1 + E(r,b-1)) + ( r/(r+b) )*E(r-1, b) ]

Now, we can build up the values starting from the base cases.

Base case: when r = 0 and b = 0, E(0, 0) = 0.

When r = 0, E(0, b) = sum_{k=1}^{b} (1/(b - k + 1)) ) ??? Wait, no.

Wait, if r = 0, all remaining cards are black. So, Alice will keep guessing black, and every time she will be correct. So, E(0, b) = b.

Similarly, if b = 0, E(r, 0) = r.

Wait, that makes sense because if there are no other color left, she can just guess the remaining ones all correctly.

So, the boundary conditions are:

E(r, 0) = r for any r,
E(0, b) = b for any b,
and E(0, 0) = 0.

With this, we can compute E(r, b) for all r and b up to 3.

Let me tabulate the possible states:

We have r ranging from 0 to 3 and b also from 0 to 3.

We can compute E(r, b) for each pair (r, b) starting from smaller values.

Let me create a table:

First, fill in the base cases:

E(0, 0) = 0

E(r, 0) = r for r = 1,2,3

E(0, b) = b for b = 1,2,3

Now, let's compute E(1, 1):

E(1,1) = max [ (1/2)*(1 + E(0,1)) + (1/2)*E(1,0),
               (1/2)*(1 + E(1,0)) + (1/2)*E(0,1) ]

Compute both options:

First option: (1/2)*(1 + 1) + (1/2)*1 = (1/2)*2 + (1/2)*1 = 1 + 0.5 = 1.5

Second option: same as first, because it's symmetric. So, E(1,1)=1.5

Which is 3/2.

Next, compute E(1,2):

So, r=1, b=2.

We have to choose between guessing red or black.

Option 1: Guess red.

Probability correct: 1/3.

Then, move to E(0,2).

Probability incorrect: 2/3.

Move to E(1,1).

So, expected value: (1/3)*(1 + E(0,2)) + (2/3)*E(1,1)

E(0,2)=2, E(1,1)=1.5

Thus: (1/3)*(1 + 2) + (2/3)*1.5 = (1/3)*3 + (2/3)*1.5 = 1 + 1 = 2

Option 2: Guess black.

Probability correct: 2/3.

Move to E(1,1).

Probability incorrect: 1/3.

Move to E(0,2).

Expected value: (2/3)*(1 + E(1,1)) + (1/3)*E(0,2)

= (2/3)*(1 + 1.5) + (1/3)*2 = (2/3)*2.5 + (2/3) ≈ 1.6667 + 0.6667 ≈ 2.3333

So, comparing both options, the second option is better, giving approximately 2.3333, which is 7/3.

Hence, E(1,2)=7/3≈2.3333.

Similarly, E(2,1) should be the same due to symmetry, so E(2,1)=7/3.

Moving on to E(1,3):

r=1, b=3.

Options: Guess red or black.

Guessing red:

Probability correct: 1/4.

Move to E(0,3)=3.

Probability incorrect: 3/4.

Move to E(1,2)=7/3≈2.3333.

Expected value: (1/4)*(1 + 3) + (3/4)*(7/3) = (1/4)*4 + (3/4)*(7/3) = 1 + (7/4) = 1 + 1.75 = 2.75 = 11/4.

Guessing black:

Probability correct: 3/4.

Move to E(1,2)=7/3.

Probability incorrect: 1/4.

Move to E(0,3)=3.

Expected value: (3/4)*(1 + 7/3) + (1/4)*3.

Compute this:

(3/4)*(10/3) + (3/4) = (3/4)*(10/3 + 1) = Hmm, wait, no.

Wait, 1 + 7/3 = 10/3.

So, (3/4)*(10/3) + (1/4)*3 = (10/4) + (3/4) = (10 + 3)/4 = 13/4 = 3.25.

Comparing the two options, 11/4=2.75 vs 13/4=3.25. So the better option is guessing black, resulting in 13/4.

Thus, E(1,3)=13/4.

Similarly, E(3,1)=13/4.

Now, moving on to E(2,2):

r=2, b=2.

Guessing red or black. Since they are equal, the probability is 0.5.

Either way, the expected value will be the same.

Compute expected value:

Option 1: Guess red.

Probability correct: 2/4=1/2.

Move to E(1,2)=7/3.

Probability incorrect: 1/2.

Move to E(2,1)=7/3.

So, expected value: (1/2)*(1 + 7/3) + (1/2)*(7/3)

Simplify:

(1/2)*(10/3) + (1/2)*(7/3) = (5/3) + (7/6) = Convert to sixths: 10/6 + 7/6 = 17/6 ≈2.8333.

Similarly, if we had guessed black, it's the same result.

Alternatively, let me verify:

(1/2)*(1 + E(1,2)) + (1/2)*E(2,1)

= (1/2)*(1 + 7/3) + (1/2)*(7/3)

= (1/2)*(10/3) + (7/6)

= 5/3 + 7/6 = 10/6 + 7/6 = 17/6.

So, E(2,2)=17/6≈2.8333.

Next, E(2,3):

r=2, b=3.

Options: Guess red or black.

Since b > r, better to guess black.

Compute expected value:

Guess black.

Probability correct: 3/5.

Move to E(2,2)=17/6.

Probability incorrect: 2/5.

Move to E(1,3)=13/4.

So, expected value:

(3/5)*(1 + 17/6) + (2/5)*(13/4)

Compute 1 + 17/6 = 23/6.

So, (3/5)*(23/6) + (2/5)*(13/4)

Calculate each term:

(3/5)*(23/6) = (69)/30 = 23/10 ≈2.3

(2/5)*(13/4) = (26)/20 = 13/10 ≈1.3

Total: 23/10 + 13/10 = 36/10 = 18/5=3.6.

Alternatively, writing as fractions:

(3/5)*(23/6) = (69)/(30) = 23/10

(2/5)*(13/4) = (26)/(20) = 13/10

Adding together: 23/10 +13/10=36/10=18/5.

So, E(2,3)=18/5=3.6.

Similarly, E(3,2)=18/5.

Finally, E(3,3):

This is our initial state. Let's compute E(3,3).

Here, r=3, b=3.

So, since r=b, Alice can choose either color. It won't matter because the probabilities are the same.

Let's choose to guess red.

Compute expected value:

(3/6)*(1 + E(2,3)) + (3/6)*E(3,2)

Simplify:

(1/2)*(1 + 18/5) + (1/2)*(18/5)

Compute 1 + 18/5 = 23/5.

So, (1/2)*(23/5) + (1/2)*(18/5) = (23/10) + (9/5) = 23/10 + 18/10 = 41/10=4.1.

Alternatively, using fractions:

(1/2)*(1 + 18/5) = (1/2)*(23/5) =23/10.

(1/2)*(18/5)=9/5=18/10.

Total:23/10 +18/10=41/10=4.1.

Which is 41/10, so m=41, n=10, which are coprime. Therefore, m + n=51.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes when working through multiple steps, it's easy to make an error.

Starting from E(3,3):

Each guess, choosing red or black, with probability 1/2 each.

If correct, move to E(2,3)=18/5.

If incorrect, move to E(3,2)=18/5.

Therefore, E(3,3)= (1/2)*(1 + E(2,3)) + (1/2)*E(3,2)

Which is exactly (1/2)*(1 + 18/5) + (1/2)*(18/5)

As above, 1 + 18/5=23/5, times 1/2 is 23/10.

Plus, 18/5 times 1/2 is 9/5.

23/10 + 18/10=41/10.

Yes, that's 4.1, which is 41/10.

So, the expected number is 41/10, which reduces to lowest terms as 41 and 10 are coprime. Hence, m=41, n=10, so m + n=51.

Therefore, the answer is 51.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{51}
</think>

Alice knows that 3 red cards and 3 black cards will be revealed to her one at a time in random order. Before each card is revealed, Alice must guess its color. We need to find the expected number of cards she will guess correctly if she plays optimally.

To solve this, we define \( E(r, b) \) as the expected number of correct guesses when there are \( r \) red cards and \( b \) black cards remaining. The key steps are as follows:

1. **Base Cases**:
   - \( E(r, 0) = r \) for any \( r \) (if only red cards are left, Alice will guess all correctly).
   - \( E(0, b) = b \) for any \( b \) (if only black cards are left, Alice will guess all correctly).
   - \( E(0, 0) = 0 \) (no cards left to guess).

2. **Recursive Relations**:
   - For each state \( (r, b) \), if \( r > b \), guess red: \( E(r, b) = \max \left( \frac{r}{r+b}(1 + E(r-1, b)) + \frac{b}{r+b}E(r, b-1), \frac{b}{r+b}(1 + E(r, b-1)) + \frac{r}{r+b}E(r-1, b) \right) \).
   - For each state \( (r, b) \), if \( b > r \), guess black: similar logic as above.
   - If \( r = b \), the choice does not matter.

3. **Calculations**:
   - Compute \( E(1, 1) \): Both options give the same result, \( \frac{3}{2} \).
   - Compute \( E(1, 2) \): Guessing black is better, resulting in \( \frac{7}{3} \).
   - Compute \( E(2, 1) \): Same as \( E(1, 2) \), resulting in \( \frac{7}{3} \).
   - Compute \( E(1, 3) \): Guessing black is better, resulting in \( \frac{13}{4} \).
   - Compute \( E(3, 1) \): Same as \( E(1, 3) \), resulting in \( \frac{13}{4} \).
   - Compute \( E(2, 2) \): Equal cards, resulting in \( \frac{17}{6} \).
   - Compute \( E(2, 3) \): Guessing black is better, resulting in \( \frac{18}{5} \).
   - Compute \( E(3, 2) \): Same as \( E(2, 3) \), resulting in \( \frac{18}{5} \).
   - Finally, compute \( E(3, 3) \): Results in \( \frac{41}{10} \).

The expected number of correct guesses is \( \frac{41}{10} \). Thus, \( m = 41 \) and \( n = 10 \), leading to \( m + n = 51 \).
