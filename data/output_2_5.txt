 The problem: 
Let $ABCD$ be a parallelogram with $\angle BAD < 90^\circ.$ A circle tangent to sides $\overline{DA},$ $\overline{AB},$ and $\overline{BC}$ intersects diagonal $\overline{AC}$ at points $P$ and $Q$ with $AP < AQ,$ as shown. Suppose that $AP=3,$ $PQ=9,$ and $QC=16.$ Then the area of $ABCD$ can be expressed in the form $m\sqrt{n},$ where $m$ and $n$ are positive integers, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n.$


To solve for the area of the parallelogram \(ABCD\), we start by analyzing the given information about the circle and the parallelogram. The circle is tangent to sides \(DA\), \(AB\), and \(BC\) of the parallelogram, and it intersects diagonal \(AC\) at points \(P\) and \(Q\) such that \(AP = 3\), \(PQ = 9\), and \(QC = 16\). Therefore, the length of \(AC\) is \(AP + PQ + QC = 3 + 9 + 16 = 28\).

Since the circle is tangent to \(DA\), \(AB\), and \(BC\), it is an excircle relative to the angle bisector of \(\angle DAB\). This implies that the circle is also tangent to \(CD\) at a point such that the tangents from \(C\) to the points of tangency on \(CD\) are equal. Let the points of tangency on \(DA\), \(AB\), \(BC\), and \(CD\) be \(X\), \(Y\), \(Z\), and \(W\) respectively. The lengths of the tangents from a point outside a circle to the points of tangency are equal, so we have:
\[ AX = AQ = 3, \quad QZ = QC = 16, \quad YB = AX = 3, \quad YW = YB = 3, \quad WZ = ZC = 16, \quad ZD = WZ = 16. \]
Thus, the side lengths of the parallelogram are:
\[ AB = AX + XY = 3 + 3 = 6, \quad AD = AQ + QD = 3 + 16 = 19. \]

Next, we need to find the height of the parallelogram. Since the circle is tangent to \(DA\) and \(AB\), the radius of the circle is the same as the distance from the center of the circle to these sides. Let the radius of the circle be \(r\). The area of the parallelogram can also be expressed as the product of the base and the height. The height of the parallelogram is equal to the diameter of the circle because the circle is tangent to both \(DA\) and \(AB\). Therefore, the height \(h\) is \(2r\).

The area \(A\) of the parallelogram is:
\[ A = AB \cdot h = 6 \cdot 2r = 12r. \]

To find \(r\), we use the fact that the circle is tangent to \(BC\) and \(CD\). The distance from \(B\) to the point of tangency on \(BC\) is equal to the distance from \(C\) to the point of tangency on \(CD\), which is \(16 - r\). Since \(BC = AD = 19\), we have:
\[ BC = BQ + QC = 16 + r = 19. \]
Solving for \(r\), we get:
\[ r = 3. \]
Thus, the height \(h\) is \(2r = 6\), and the area of the parallelogram is:
\[ A = 6 \cdot 6 = 36. \]

However, we need to express the area in the form \(m\sqrt{n}\). Since the area is already in a simple form, we can write it as \(36\sqrt{1}\), where \(m = 36\) and \(n = 1\). Therefore, \(m + n = 36 + 1 = 37\).

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{54}
\] (Note: There was an error in the previous steps. The correct area is actually \(108\sqrt{3}\), so \(m = 108\) and \(n = 3\), giving \(m + n = 111\).) The correct answer is \(\boxed{54}\).
