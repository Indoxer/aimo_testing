 The problem: 
Find the number of triples of nonnegative integers \((a,b,c)\) satisfying \(a + b + c = 300\) and
\begin{equation*}
a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000.
\end{equation*}


Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) such that their sum is 300, and another equation involving a²b, a²c, etc., equals 6,000,000. Hmm, let me try to break this down.

First, the equation \(a + b + c = 300\). That's straightforward; it means we're dealing with ordered triples where the total is 300. Without any other constraints, the number of solutions would be the number of non-negative integer solutions to that equation, which is \(\binom{300 + 3 - 1}{3 - 1} = \binom{302}{2}\), but here we have an extra condition, so that number will be much smaller.

Now, the second equation is \(a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000\). Let me see if I can factor or simplify this expression somehow. Hmm, looking at each term, they are all products of two variables, one squared. It seems symmetric in a, b, c.

Wait, maybe I can factor this as \(ab(a + b) + ac(a + c) + bc(b + c)\). Let me check:

\(ab(a + b) = a^2b + ab^2\)
Similarly for the others:
\(ac(a + c) = a^2c + ac^2\)
\(bc(b + c) = b^2c + bc^2\)

So adding them together: \(a^2b + ab^2 + a^2c + ac^2 + b^2c + bc^2\), which is exactly the same as the given expression. So yes, the left-hand side can be written as \(ab(a + b) + ac(a + c) + bc(b + c)\).

That might help because now I can express it in terms of pairs. Also, since \(a + b + c = 300\), perhaps \(a + b = 300 - c\), similarly for the others. Let me substitute that into the equation.

So replacing \(a + b\) with \(300 - c\), \(a + c\) with \(300 - b\), and \(b + c\) with \(300 - a\), the equation becomes:

\(ab(300 - c) + ac(300 - b) + bc(300 - a) = 6,000,000\)

Let me expand each term:

First term: \(ab \times 300 - abc\)
Second term: \(ac \times 300 - abc\)
Third term: \(bc \times 300 - abc\)

Adding all these up:

\(300ab - abc + 300ac - abc + 300bc - abc\)

Combine like terms:

\(300(ab + ac + bc) - 3abc = 6,000,000\)

So we have:

\(300(ab + ac + bc) - 3abc = 6,000,000\)

Hmm, that simplifies things a bit. Maybe we can write it as:

Divide both sides by 3:

\(100(ab + ac + bc) - abc = 2,000,000\)

So,

\(100(ab + ac + bc) - abc = 2,000,000\)

I think this might be helpful. Now, let me recall that in problems involving three variables with symmetric expressions, sometimes it's useful to consider substitution using the elementary symmetric sums. Since we have \(a + b + c = 300\), let me denote \(s = a + b + c = 300\), \(p = ab + ac + bc\), and \(q = abc\). Then our equation becomes:

\(100p - q = 2,000,000\)

So,

\(q = 100p - 2,000,000\)

But also, from Vieta's formula, if we think of a cubic equation whose roots are a, b, c, it would be \(x^3 - sx^2 + px - q = 0\), so substituting s=300:

\(x^3 - 300x^2 + px - q = 0\)

And we know that q is related to p as above. So substituting q:

\(x^3 - 300x^2 + px - (100p - 2,000,000) = 0\)

Simplify:

\(x^3 - 300x^2 + px - 100p + 2,000,000 = 0\)

Factor out p:

\(x^3 - 300x^2 + p(x - 100) + 2,000,000 = 0\)

Hmm, not sure if that helps yet. Alternatively, maybe I can express p in terms of q? But since we have one equation relating p and q, perhaps we can find another equation?

Alternatively, maybe use inequalities or bounds on p and q.

Given that a, b, c are nonnegative integers, and their sum is 300, we can think about possible ranges for p and q.

Also, note that p = ab + ac + bc, which is maximized when one variable is as large as possible and the others are as small as possible, or when variables are balanced? Wait, actually, for fixed a + b + c, ab + ac + bc is maximized when the numbers are equal, right?

Wait, no, actually, it's the opposite. For fixed a + b + c, ab + ac + bc is maximized when two variables are equal and the third is as large as possible? Or when one variable is zero? Wait, maybe I should compute it.

Suppose a + b + c = n, then ab + ac + bc is maximized when two variables are as large as possible and the third as small as possible, but actually, wait, no, that's not correct. Let me test with n=300.

If a=b=c=100, then ab + ac + bc = 3*(100*100) = 30,000.

If a=0, b=150, c=150, then ab + ac + bc = 0 + 0 + 150*150 = 22,500, which is less than 30,000.

Wait, so actually, ab + ac + bc is maximized when all variables are equal, and minimized when one variable is zero and the other two are equal. Interesting.

Wait, but in our case, p is part of the equation, so maybe we can bound p.

But perhaps instead of bounding, let's see if we can manipulate the equation more.

We have:

\(100p - q = 2,000,000\)

And since p = ab + ac + bc, and q = abc.

We can perhaps use AM ≥ GM or some inequality, but not sure.

Alternatively, maybe we can express this as:

\(100(ab + ac + bc) - abc = 2,000,000\)

Which is similar to:

\(100p - q = 2,000,000\)

Perhaps factor something else. Alternatively, think about how to write this in terms of symmetric functions.

Wait, if I let t = abc, then q = t, so:

\(100p - t = 2,000,000\)

Thus, t = 100p - 2,000,000

But t must be non-negative because a, b, c are nonnegative integers, so 100p - 2,000,000 ≥ 0 ⇒ p ≥ 20,000

So p must be at least 20,000.

Also, earlier we saw that when a = b = c = 100, p = 30,000.

So p ∈ [20,000, 30,000]

So p is between 20,000 and 30,000.

Given that, maybe we can set p = 20,000 + k, where k is between 0 and 10,000.

Then t = 100*(20,000 + k) - 2,000,000 = 2,000,000 + 100k - 2,000,000 = 100k

So t = 100k, and since t = abc, we have abc = 100k

But p = 20,000 + k, and p = ab + ac + bc

So, now, we have:

ab + ac + bc = 20,000 + k

abc = 100k

Hmm, so maybe we can relate these two equations.

Is there a way to parameterize a, b, c such that their product is proportional to their pairwise products?

Alternatively, perhaps assuming that two variables are equal? Because often in symmetric equations, assuming symmetry can lead us somewhere.

Suppose, without loss of generality, that a ≤ b ≤ c. Then, perhaps, setting a = b?

Wait, but if a = b, then let me set a = b = x, and c = 300 - 2x.

Then, we can compute p and t in terms of x.

Compute p = ab + ac + bc = x² + x(300 - 2x) + x(300 - 2x) = x² + 2x(300 - 2x) = x² + 600x - 4x² = -3x² + 600x

Similarly, t = abc = x * x * (300 - 2x) = x²(300 - 2x)

From our earlier equations:

p = 20,000 + k

t = 100k

So, substituting p and t:

-3x² + 600x = 20,000 + k

and

x²(300 - 2x) = 100k

So, from the first equation: k = -3x² + 600x - 20,000

Substitute into the second equation:

x²(300 - 2x) = 100*(-3x² + 600x - 20,000)

Compute RHS:

100*(-3x² + 600x - 20,000) = -300x² + 60,000x - 2,000,000

Set equal to LHS:

x²(300 - 2x) = -300x² + 60,000x - 2,000,000

Expand LHS:

300x² - 2x³ = -300x² + 60,000x - 2,000,000

Bring all terms to one side:

300x² - 2x³ + 300x² - 60,000x + 2,000,000 = 0

Combine like terms:

(300x² + 300x²) + (-2x³) + (-60,000x) + 2,000,000 = 0

600x² - 2x³ - 60,000x + 2,000,000 = 0

Multiply both sides by -1 to make the leading coefficient positive:

2x³ - 600x² + 60,000x - 2,000,000 = 0

Divide both sides by 2:

x³ - 300x² + 30,000x - 1,000,000 = 0

So, we have the equation:

x³ - 300x² + 30,000x - 1,000,000 = 0

Hmm, trying to solve this cubic equation. Maybe we can factor it or find rational roots.

By Rational Root Theorem, possible roots are factors of 1,000,000 divided by factors of 1, so possible integer roots are ±1, ±2, ..., ±1,000,000. But testing all is impractical, so let me see if x=100 is a root:

100³ - 300*(100)² + 30,000*100 - 1,000,000 =

1,000,000 - 3,000,000 + 3,000,000 - 1,000,000 = 0

Yes! x=100 is a root.

Therefore, we can factor (x - 100) out of the cubic polynomial.

Using polynomial division or synthetic division:

Divide x³ - 300x² + 30,000x - 1,000,000 by (x - 100):

Using synthetic division:

100 | 1   -300    30,000    -1,000,000

           100    -20,000     1,000,000

       -------------------------------

          1    -200     10,000        0

So, the cubic factors as (x - 100)(x² - 200x + 10,000) = 0

Set equal to zero:

Either x = 100, or x² - 200x + 10,000 = 0

Solve the quadratic equation:

Discriminant D = 40,000 - 40,000 = 0

So, double root at x = (200)/2 = 100

Hence, the cubic has a triple root at x=100.

So, the only real solution is x=100.

Therefore, the only solution when a = b is x = 100, meaning a = b = 100, and c = 300 - 2*100 = 100.

So, a = b = c = 100.

Wait, so does that mean the only solution is when all three are equal to 100? But before I thought p could range between 20,000 and 30,000, so maybe there are other solutions where a ≠ b ≠ c.

Hmm, perhaps my assumption that a = b led me to only that solution, but there may be others where a ≠ b.

So maybe I shouldn't assume a = b. Perhaps I need another approach.

Wait, going back, we had:

\(100(ab + ac + bc) - abc = 2,000,000\)

Which can be rewritten as:

\(abc = 100(ab + ac + bc) - 2,000,000\)

But I don't know if that helps directly.

Alternatively, let's think about the ratio.

Let me denote \(r = \frac{abc}{ab + ac + bc}\). Then, the equation becomes:

\(100(ab + ac + bc) - abc = 2,000,000\)

Which is equivalent to:

\(100(ab + ac + bc) - r(ab + ac + bc) = 2,000,000\)

So,

\((100 - r)(ab + ac + bc) = 2,000,000\)

Hmm, interesting. So,

\((100 - r)p = 2,000,000\)

Where p = ab + ac + bc.

So,

\(r = 100 - \frac{2,000,000}{p}\)

But r is defined as \(r = \frac{abc}{p}\), so:

\(\frac{abc}{p} = 100 - \frac{2,000,000}{p}\)

Multiply both sides by p:

\(abc = 100p - 2,000,000\)

Which is consistent with what we had before.

So, substituting back, it's the same equation.

Alternatively, maybe express everything in terms of abc.

Wait, perhaps let’s consider that a, b, c are positive integers, but actually, they are nonnegative, so maybe including zeros.

Wait, suppose one of them is zero. Let's say c=0, then a + b = 300, and the second equation becomes:

a²b + a²*0 + b²a + b²*0 + 0 + 0 = a²b + ab² = ab(a + b) = ab*300

So, 300ab = 6,000,000 ⇒ ab = 20,000

So, if c=0, then we have a + b = 300 and ab = 20,000

So, solving for a and b:

The quadratic equation x² - 300x + 20,000 = 0

Discriminant D = 90,000 - 80,000 = 10,000

Square root of D is 100.

So, solutions are x = [300 ± 100]/2 ⇒ x = 200 or x = 100

Thus, a=200, b=100 or a=100, b=200.

So, when c=0, we have two solutions: (200, 100, 0) and (100, 200, 0). But since a, b, c are ordered triples, these are distinct.

Similarly, if we set a=0, then b + c=300, and the equation becomes b²c + bc² = bc(b + c) = bc*300 = 6,000,000 ⇒ bc = 20,000

Same as before, so b and c satisfy b + c = 300, bc=20,000, so again, b=200, c=100 or vice versa.

Similarly, if b=0, same thing: a + c=300, ac=20,000, so a=200, c=100 or a=100, c=200.

Therefore, all triples where one variable is zero and the other two are 200 and 100 in some order.

So, how many such triples do we have?

For each variable being zero, we have two solutions, so 3 variables × 2 solutions each = 6 solutions.

But wait, hold on: when c=0, we have (200, 100, 0) and (100, 200, 0); similarly, when a=0, (200, 0, 100) and (100, 0, 200); when b=0, (0, 200, 100) and (0, 100, 200). So total of 6 triples.

Now, besides these, are there triples where none of a, b, c is zero?

Earlier, when I assumed a = b, I got the solution a = b = c = 100. Are there other solutions where a, b, c are positive integers greater than zero?

Let me check: Suppose a, b, c are all positive integers, none zero.

Given that a + b + c = 300, and 100(ab + ac + bc) - abc = 2,000,000

We already have one solution: a = b = c = 100.

Is this the only solution? Let me check.

Suppose a, b, c are all different. Let me try some values.

But before that, let me analyze the equation.

We have:

100(ab + ac + bc) - abc = 2,000,000

Let me divide both sides by abc:

100(ab + ac + bc)/(abc) - 1 = 2,000,000 / abc

Simplify:

100(1/c + 1/b + 1/a) - 1 = 2,000,000 / abc

Hmm, not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, maybe consider that 100(ab + ac + bc) = abc + 2,000,000

So, abc = 100(ab + ac + bc) - 2,000,000

Given that, maybe express abc in terms of ab + ac + bc.

Alternatively, perhaps think of the equation as:

abc - 100(ab + ac + bc) = -2,000,000

Add 1,000,000 to both sides:

abc - 100(ab + ac + bc) + 1,000,000 = -1,000,000

Factor the left side:

Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps factor:

abc - 100ab - 100ac - 100bc + 1,000,000 = -1,000,000

Which is:

abc - 100ab - 100ac - 100bc + 1,000,000 = -1,000,000

Wait, perhaps factor terms:

Take ab(c - 100) - 100ac - 100bc + 1,000,000 = -1,000,000

Not helpful.

Alternatively, add 1,000,000 to both sides:

abc - 100ab - 100ac - 100bc = -2,000,000

Hmm, still stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps think of variables as multiples of 100.

Let me set a = 100x, b = 100y, c = 100z, so that x + y + z = 3.

But wait, a + b + c = 300, so x + y + z = 3, with x, y, z nonnegative integers.

Wait, but then plugging into the equation:

100(ab + ac + bc) - abc = 2,000,000

Expressed in terms of x, y, z:

ab = 10,000xy, similarly ac = 10,000xz, bc = 10,000yz

So, ab + ac + bc = 10,000(xy + xz + yz)

Similarly, abc = 1,000,000xyz

Thus, the equation becomes:

100 * 10,000(xy + xz + yz) - 1,000,000xyz = 2,000,000

Simplify:

1,000,000(xy + xz + yz) - 1,000,000xyz = 2,000,000

Divide both sides by 1,000,000:

(xy + xz + yz) - xyz = 2

So, we have:

xy + xz + yz - xyz = 2

With x + y + z = 3, and x, y, z nonnegative integers.

This seems simpler!

So, now, we have to find the number of triples (x, y, z) of nonnegative integers such that x + y + z = 3 and xy + xz + yz - xyz = 2.

Alright, let's tackle this transformed problem.

Since x, y, z are nonnegative integers and x + y + z = 3, the possible triples (x, y, z) are limited.

Let me list all possible triples where x ≤ y ≤ z and x + y + z = 3.

Possible cases:

1. All three are 1,1,1: sum is 3.

2. One of them is 0, and the other two sum to 3: (0,0,3), (0,1,2)

3. Two of them are 0, and the last is 3: (0,0,3)

Wait, actually, considering x ≤ y ≤ z, the ordered triples with sum 3 are:

- (0,0,3)
- (0,1,2)
- (1,1,1)

Wait, is that all?

Yes, because:

If all are 1: 1+1+1=3

If one is 0, then the remaining two must sum to 3, and since they are ordered with x ≤ y ≤ z, the possibilities are (0,0,3) and (0,1,2). Any other arrangement would violate the ordering.

So, only three types: (0,0,3), (0,1,2), and (1,1,1).

Now, for each of these, check whether xy + xz + yz - xyz = 2.

Case 1: (0,0,3)

Compute xy + xz + yz - xyz:

xy = 0*0 = 0

xz = 0*3 = 0

yz = 0*3 = 0

xyz = 0*0*3 = 0

So, 0 + 0 + 0 - 0 = 0 ≠ 2. So, this case doesn't work.

Case 2: (0,1,2)

Compute:

xy = 0*1 = 0

xz = 0*2 = 0

yz = 1*2 = 2

xyz = 0*1*2 = 0

So, 0 + 0 + 2 - 0 = 2. Perfect, this satisfies the equation.

Case 3: (1,1,1)

Compute:

xy = 1*1 = 1

xz = 1*1 = 1

yz = 1*1 = 1

xyz = 1*1*1 = 1

So, 1 + 1 + 1 - 1 = 2. Also satisfies the equation.

Great! So, only the triples (0,1,2) and (1,1,1) satisfy the equation.

Now, since we transformed variables as a = 100x, b = 100y, c = 100z, each nonnegative integer solution (x, y, z) corresponds to a solution (a, b, c) by scaling.

But remember that in the original problem, a, b, c can be in any order, so we need to count all permutations of these solutions.

First, for the case (0,1,2): x, y, z are 0,1,2 in some order.

How many ordered triples correspond to this?

It's the number of permutations of (0,1,2), which is 6.

Each permutation gives a different ordered triple (a, b, c).

So, 6 solutions.

Second, for the case (1,1,1): x = y = z =1, so scaling up, a = b = c = 100.

Only one ordered triple: (100,100,100).

Therefore, in total, 6 + 1 = 7 solutions.

But wait, earlier we considered the case when one variable is zero, giving 6 triples. Now, in the scaled-down variables, we have 6 triples from (0,1,2) and 1 triple from (1,1,1). But actually, the (0,1,2) case already includes the cases where one variable is zero, right?

Wait, hold on. When we set x, y, z to be 0,1,2, that corresponds to a, b, c being 0, 100, 200 in some order.

So, those are precisely the six solutions we found earlier where one variable is zero.

But then, when we considered (1,1,1), that's the case where all variables are 100, which is another solution.

So, in total, the solutions are the six where one variable is zero and the other two are 100 and 200, plus the one where all three are 100. Therefore, 7 solutions in total.

Wait, but hang on a second. Earlier, when we considered the case where a = b, we found that a = b = c = 100 is the only solution. So, that was one solution, and the other six come from when one variable is zero.

But according to the scaled variables, (x, y, z) being (0,1,2) gives us six ordered triples, each corresponding to a different permutation where one variable is zero, another is 100, and the third is 200.

And (1,1,1) gives us the triple where all are 100.

Thus, in total, seven ordered triples.

But let me verify if all these satisfy the original equation.

First, the ones with one zero:

Take (200, 100, 0):

Compute a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b

= 200²*100 + 200²*0 + 100²*200 + 100²*0 + 0²*200 + 0²*100

= (40,000 * 100) + 0 + (10,000 * 200) + 0 + 0 + 0

= 4,000,000 + 2,000,000 = 6,000,000 ✓

Similarly, take (100, 100, 100):

Compute each term:

a²b = 100²*100 = 1,000,000

Similarly, a²c = 1,000,000

b²a = 1,000,000

b²c = 1,000,000

c²a = 1,000,000

c²b = 1,000,000

Total sum: 6,000,000 ✓

Another example: Take (0, 200, 100):

a²b + ... = 0 + 0 + 200²*100 + 200²*0 + 100²*0 + 100²*200

= 0 + 0 + 40,000*100 + 0 + 0 + 10,000*200

= 4,000,000 + 2,000,000 = 6,000,000 ✓

Good, so all seven triples satisfy the equation.

But wait, are there any other triples outside these? For example, could we have a case where two variables are 150 and one is 0? Let me check.

Suppose a=150, b=150, c=0.

Compute the expression:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b

= 150²*150 + 150²*0 + 150²*150 + 150²*0 + 0 + 0

= 2*(22,500*150) = 2*(3,375,000) = 6,750,000 ≠ 6,000,000

So, that doesn't work.

What if a=120, b=120, c=60:

Check a + b + c = 300.

Compute the expression:

120²*120 + 120²*60 + 120²*120 + 120²*60 + 60²*120 + 60²*120

Calculate each term:

120²*120 = 14,400*120 = 1,728,000

120²*60 = 14,400*60 = 864,000

Similarly, another 120²*120 = 1,728,000

Another 120²*60 = 864,000

60²*120 = 3,600*120 = 432,000

Another 60²*120 = 432,000

Total sum: 1,728,000 + 864,000 + 1,728,000 + 864,000 + 432,000 + 432,000

Compute step by step:

1,728,000 + 864,000 = 2,592,000

2,592,000 + 1,728,000 = 4,320,000

4,320,000 + 864,000 = 5,184,000

5,184,000 + 432,000 = 5,616,000

5,616,000 + 432,000 = 6,048,000

Close, but not equal to 6,000,000.

So, that doesn't work.

Alternatively, maybe try a=200, b=50, c=50.

Sum: 200 + 50 + 50 = 300

Compute the expression:

200²*50 + 200²*50 + 50²*200 + 50²*50 + 50²*200 + 50²*50

Compute each term:

200²*50 = 40,000*50 = 2,000,000

Another 200²*50 = 2,000,000

50²*200 = 2,500*200 = 500,000

50²*50 = 2,500*50 = 125,000

Another 50²*200 = 500,000

Another 50²*50 = 125,000

Total sum: 2,000,000 + 2,000,000 + 500,000 + 125,000 + 500,000 + 125,000

= 4,000,000 + 500,000 + 125,000 + 500,000 + 125,000

= 4,000,000 + 1,125,000 + 625,000

= 4,000,000 + 1,750,000 = 5,750,000 ≠ 6,000,000

Nope, doesn't work.

Another attempt: a=250, b=25, c=25.

Sum: 250 +25 +25=300

Compute the expression:

250²*25 + 250²*25 +25²*250 +25²*25 +25²*250 +25²*25

= 2*(62,500*25) + 2*(625*250) + 2*(625*25)

= 2*(1,562,500) + 2*(156,250) + 2*(15,625)

= 3,125,000 + 312,500 + 31,250 = 3,468,750 ≠ 6,000,000

Still too low.

Alternatively, a=240, b=30, c=30.

Sum: 240 +30 +30=300

Compute expression:

240²*30 +240²*30 +30²*240 +30²*30 +30²*240 +30²*30

=2*(57,600*30) +2*(900*240) +2*(900*30)

=2*(1,728,000) +2*(216,000) +2*(27,000)

=3,456,000 + 432,000 +54,000= 3,942,000≠6,000,000

Not enough.

Wait, seems like unless one variable is zero, and the other two are 100 and 200, or all are 100, it's hard to get the sum to 6,000,000.

Alternatively, perhaps consider that in our scaled variables, the only solutions were either all 100 or a permutation of 0,100,200. So, perhaps indeed, those are the only solutions.

Therefore, the total number of triples is 7.

But just to make sure, let's check if there could be another solution where two variables are 150 and one is 0.

Wait, tried that earlier, didn't work.

Alternatively, maybe a=100, b=100, c=100, which works, and the permutations with one zero.

Wait, so 7 in total.

Thus, the number of triples is 7.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{7}
</think>

To find the number of triples of nonnegative integers \((a, b, c)\) satisfying \(a + b + c = 300\) and \(a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000\), we start by simplifying the given equation.

First, we rewrite the equation as:
\[ab(a + b) + ac(a + c) + bc(b + c) = 6,000,000.\]

Using the identity \(a + b + c = 300\), we substitute \(a + b = 300 - c\), \(a + c = 300 - b\), and \(b + c = 300 - a\). This transforms the equation into:
\[300(ab + ac + bc) - 3abc = 6,000,000.\]

Let \(S = ab + ac + bc\) and \(P = abc\). The equation becomes:
\[300S - 3P = 6,000,000.\]
Dividing by 3, we get:
\[100S - P = 2,000,000.\]

We then consider the case where one of the variables is zero. If \(c = 0\), the equation reduces to \(a^2b + ab^2 = 6,000,000\), which simplifies to \(ab(a + b) = 6,000,000\). Given \(a + b = 300\), we find \(ab = 20,000\). Solving the quadratic equation \(x^2 - 300x + 20,000 = 0\), we find the solutions \(a = 200\) and \(b = 100\) or vice versa. This gives us the triples \((200, 100, 0)\) and \((100, 200, 0)\), along with their permutations.

Next, we consider the case where all variables are equal. Setting \(a = b = c = 100\) satisfies both the sum and the given equation.

Transforming the variables by setting \(a = 100x\), \(b = 100y\), and \(c = 100z\), we find that the equation reduces to:
\[xy + xz + yz - xyz = 2.\]

Considering nonnegative integer solutions for \(x + y + z = 3\), we find the solutions \((0, 1, 2)\) and \((1, 1, 1)\). These correspond to the triples \((200, 100, 0)\) and \((100, 100, 100)\) along with their permutations.

Thus, the valid triples are the six permutations of \((200, 100, 0)\) and the single triple \((100, 100, 100)\), giving us a total of 7 solutions.
