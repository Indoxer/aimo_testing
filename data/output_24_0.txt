 The problem: 
There is a positive real number $x$ not equal to either $\tfrac{1}{20}$ or $\tfrac{1}{2}$ such that\[\log_{20x} (22x)=\log_{2x} (202x).\]The value $\log_{20x} (22x)$ can be written as $\log_{10} (\tfrac{m}{n})$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.


Okay, so I've got this logarithm problem here, and I'm supposed to find the value of log base 20x of 22x, express it as log base 10 of m/n, and then find m + n where m and n are coprime positive integers. Hmm, okay. Let me try to parse this step by step.

First, let's write down what's given:

We have two logarithms that are equal:
\[
\log_{20x} (22x) = \log_{2x} (202x)
\]
And x is a positive real number not equal to 1/20 or 1/2. So we need to solve for x first, right?

Once we find x, we can compute the logarithm value and express it in terms of log base 10 of m/n.

Alright, so maybe I can use the change of base formula for logarithms here? Remember, the change of base formula says that log_b a = (ln a)/(ln b), or equivalently, (log_c a)/(log_c b) for any positive c ≠ 1. Maybe using natural logs would help me set up an equation.

Let me denote both sides with natural logarithms:

Left side: (ln(22x))/(ln(20x))
Right side: (ln(202x))/(ln(2x))

So setting them equal:
\[
\frac{\ln(22x)}{\ln(20x)} = \frac{\ln(202x)}{\ln(2x)}
\]

Hmm, cross-multiplying might help. So,
\[
\ln(22x) \cdot \ln(2x) = \ln(202x) \cdot \ln(20x)
\]

But before I go into expanding all these logarithms, which could get messy, maybe there's a smarter substitution or another property I can use.

Alternatively, since all the arguments inside the logs are linear in x, perhaps I can set y = log_{10} x or something like that. Let me think.

Wait, another idea: Maybe express each logarithm in terms of log base 10. Since the question ultimately wants the result expressed as log_{10}(m/n). So if I can manipulate the equation to express both sides in terms of log base 10, it might simplify things.

Let me recall that log_b a = (log a)/(log b), where log is base 10.

So, rewriting both sides:

Left side: log_{20x}(22x) = (log(22x)) / (log(20x))
Right side: log_{2x}(202x) = (log(202x)) / (log(2x))

So, the equation becomes:
\[
\frac{\log(22x)}{\log(20x)} = \frac{\log(202x)}{\log(2x)}
\]

Cross-multiplying:
\[
\log(22x) \cdot \log(2x) = \log(202x) \cdot \log(20x)
\]

Hmm, still looks complicated, but maybe expanding each term will help. Let me note that log(ab) = log a + log b, so each logarithm can be split into two parts.

So, let's expand all four logarithms:

First, log(22x) = log 22 + log x
Similarly, log(20x) = log 20 + log x

Same way, log(202x) = log 202 + log x
And log(2x) = log 2 + log x

So substituting back into the equation:

(log 22 + log x)(log 2 + log x) = (log 202 + log x)(log 20 + log x)

Let me denote log x as t to make it easier to write.

Let t = log x. Then our equation becomes:

(log 22 + t)(log 2 + t) = (log 202 + t)(log 20 + t)

Expanding both sides:

Left side: (log 22)(log 2) + (log 22)t + (log 2)t + t^2
Right side: (log 202)(log 20) + (log 202)t + (log 20)t + t^2

Subtracting the right side from both sides:

(log 22)(log 2) + (log 22 - log 202 - log 20)t + t^2 - [(log 202)(log 20) + (log 202 + log 2 - log 22 - log 20)t + t^2] = 0

Wait, actually, maybe instead of subtracting, let me bring everything to the left side:

Left side - Right side = 0

So,

[ (log 22)(log 2) + (log 22 - log 202 - log 20)t + t^2 ] - [ (log 202)(log 20) + (log 202 + log 2 - log 22 - log 20)t + t^2 ] = 0

Simplify term by term:

- The t^2 terms cancel out.

Now, constants:

(log 22)(log 2) - (log 202)(log 20)

Linear terms:

(log 22 - log 202 - log 20)t - (log 202 + log 2 - log 22 - log 20)t

Simplify linear terms:

Factor t:

[ (log 22 - log 202 - log 20) - (log 202 + log 2 - log 22 - log 20) ] t

Compute the coefficients inside the brackets:

Let me compute numerator:

log 22 - log 202 - log 20 - log 202 - log 2 + log 22 + log 20

Wait, maybe combining like terms step by step.

First, let's distribute the negative sign in front of the second parenthesis:

= log 22 - log 202 - log 20 - log 202 - log 2 + log 22 + log 20

Now, combine like terms:

log 22 + log 22 = 2 log 22

-log 202 - log 202 = -2 log 202

-log 20 + log 20 = 0

- log 2 remains

So overall:

2 log 22 - 2 log 202 - log 2

So the linear term coefficient is (2 log 22 - 2 log 202 - log 2) * t

Therefore, putting it all together, the equation is:

[2 log 22 - 2 log 202 - log 2] t + [ (log 22)(log 2) - (log 202)(log 20) ] = 0

Hmm, this seems a bit messy, but maybe I can factor out some terms.

Looking at the linear coefficient: 2 log 22 - 2 log 202 - log 2

I can factor out 2:

2(log 22 - log 202) - log 2

Which is 2 log(22/202) - log 2

Similarly, the constant term:

(log 22)(log 2) - (log 202)(log 20)

Hmm, maybe expressing these in terms of logarithms.

Wait, perhaps I can compute numerical values for these logarithms to see if anything simplifies.

But since all the numbers are nice, maybe they relate in some way.

Wait, 22, 20, 202, 2, 202, etc.

Wait, 202 is 10*20.2, but not sure.

Wait, 22 is 11*2, 20 is 10*2, 202 is 101*2.

Wait, 101 is a prime. Not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, maybe I can write 22 as 11*2, 20 as 10*2, 202 as 101*2.

So, let me see:

Express all logs in terms of log 2, log 10, log 11, log 5, log 101, etc.

But that might complicate more.

Alternatively, maybe take specific values or relations.

Wait, 22 is 11*2, so log 22 = log 11 + log 2

Similarly, log 202 = log 101 + log 2

Log 202 = log (101*2) = log 101 + log 2

Similarly, log 20 = log (10*2) = log 10 + log 2 = 1 + log 2, since log 10 = 1 in base 10.

Wait, but hold on, in the original problem, the logs are base 10, so when I used the change of base formula earlier, was that correct?

Wait, no, wait. Wait, actually, when I applied the change of base formula, I converted log_{a}b to (log b)/(log a), which is correct regardless of the base. But when I defined t = log x, I should clarify whether it's log base 10 or natural log.

Wait, actually, in my initial substitution, I let t = log x, but without specifying the base. That might have caused confusion because in the equation above, when I expanded, I treated log as natural log? Or was it base 10?

Wait, let's clarify:

In the original problem, all logs are in base 10 unless specified otherwise. But in the equation after applying change of base formula, I wrote log_{20x}(22x) = (log(22x))/(log(20x)), which is correct if "log" is in the same base as the original logs. Wait, but in the problem statement, the logs are in base 10, so if I use "log" as base 10, then yes, that's correct.

Therefore, going forward, "log" in the equations above is base 10.

Therefore, log 10 is 1, log 2 is approximately 0.3010, but exact expressions would be better.

So, perhaps I can assign variables to certain logarithms to simplify the equation.

Let me define:

Let A = log 2 ≈ 0.3010
Let B = log 10 = 1
Let C = log 11 ≈ 1.0414
Let D = log 101 ≈ 2.0043

Then, we can express other logs in terms of A, B, C, D.

So, log 22 = log (11*2) = C + A
log 202 = log (101*2) = D + A
log 20 = log (10*2) = B + A = 1 + A
log 202 = D + A
Similarly, log 22 = C + A
log 2 = A

So, plugging these into our equation:

[2 log 22 - 2 log 202 - log 2] t + [ (log 22)(log 2) - (log 202)(log 20) ] = 0

Substituting:

[2(C + A) - 2(D + A) - A] t + [ (C + A)A - (D + A)(1 + A) ] = 0

Simplify term by term.

First, the coefficient of t:

2(C + A) - 2(D + A) - A
= 2C + 2A - 2D - 2A - A
= 2C - 2D - A

Second, the constant term:

(C + A)A - (D + A)(1 + A)
= CA + A² - [D(1 + A) + A(1 + A)]
= CA + A² - D - DA - A - A²
= CA - D - DA - A

Simplify:

CA - D - DA - A
= CA - DA - D - A
= A(C - D - 1) - D

Putting it all together, the equation is:

(2C - 2D - A) t + (A(C - D - 1) - D) = 0

Hmm, now let me plug in the numerical approximations for A, C, D.

Given:

A = log 2 ≈ 0.3010
C = log 11 ≈ 1.0414
D = log 101 ≈ 2.0043

Compute the coefficients:

First, coefficient of t:

2C - 2D - A
= 2*1.0414 - 2*2.0043 - 0.3010
≈ 2.0828 - 4.0086 - 0.3010
≈ (2.0828 - 4.0086) - 0.3010
≈ (-1.9258) - 0.3010
≈ -2.2268

Constant term:

A(C - D - 1) - D
= 0.3010*(1.0414 - 2.0043 - 1) - 2.0043
First compute inside the parentheses:
1.0414 - 2.0043 - 1 ≈ (1.0414 - 2.0043) - 1 ≈ (-0.9629) - 1 ≈ -1.9629

Multiply by A:
0.3010*(-1.9629) ≈ -0.5919

Then subtract D:
-0.5919 - 2.0043 ≈ -2.5962

So now, the equation is approximately:

-2.2268 * t - 2.5962 = 0

Solving for t:

-2.2268 t = 2.5962

t = 2.5962 / (-2.2268) ≈ -1.165

Since t = log x, we have:

log x ≈ -1.165

Thus, x ≈ 10^{-1.165} ≈ 10^{-1 - 0.165} = 10^{-1} * 10^{-0.165} ≈ 0.1 * 0.687 ≈ 0.0687

So x is approximately 0.0687.

But the problem states that x is a positive real number not equal to 1/20 or 1/2, which is fine because 0.0687 is close to 1/15, which is approximately 0.0667, but anyway, precise value needed.

But perhaps instead of approximating, I can solve symbolically.

Wait, maybe if I keep all the expressions symbolic, I can find t exactly.

Going back to the equation:

(2C - 2D - A) t + (A(C - D - 1) - D) = 0

We can write t as:

t = [ - (A(C - D - 1) - D) ] / (2C - 2D - A )

Plugging back in terms of A, C, D:

t = [ - (A(C - D - 1) - D) ] / (2C - 2D - A )

Let me compute numerator and denominator.

Numerator:

- [ A(C - D - 1) - D ]
= -A(C - D - 1) + D
= -AC + AD + A + D

Denominator:

2C - 2D - A

So, t = (-AC + AD + A + D) / (2C - 2D - A)

Hmm, not sure if that helps, but let's see.

Alternatively, perhaps notice that 22x and 202x, 20x, 2x... maybe ratios can be simplified.

Wait, perhaps taking the ratio of the logs:

From the original equation,

log_{20x} (22x) = log_{2x} (202x)

Let me denote k = log_{20x} (22x) = log_{2x} (202x)

So, k = log_{20x} (22x)

By definition, this means that (20x)^k = 22x

Similarly, k = log_{2x} (202x) implies that (2x)^k = 202x

So, we have two equations:

1. (20x)^k = 22x
2. (2x)^k = 202x

Let me write both equations:

From equation 1:
(20x)^k = 22x
=> 20^k * x^k = 22x
=> 20^k * x^{k - 1} = 22

Equation 2:
(2x)^k = 202x
=> 2^k * x^k = 202x
=> 2^k * x^{k - 1} = 202

So now we have:

20^k * x^{k - 1} = 22 ...(1)
2^k * x^{k - 1} = 202 ...(2)

Divide equation (1) by equation (2):

(20^k * x^{k - 1}) / (2^k * x^{k - 1}) ) = 22 / 202

Simplify:

(20/2)^k = 22 / 202
10^k = 22 / 202

Simplify 22/202: 22 divides by 2 is 11, 202 divides by 2 is 101, so 11/101.

Thus,

10^k = 11/101

Taking log base 10 on both sides:

k = log_{10} (11/101) = log_{10} 11 - log_{10} 101

Which is m/n, where m = log 11 - log 101 and n = 1? Wait, but m and n must be integers.

Wait, hold on. Wait, 11 and 101 are primes, so 11/101 cannot be simplified further, so m = 11, n = 101? But wait, 11/101 is already a fraction, but the problem says "the value ... can be written as log_{10} (m/n)", so m and n are relatively prime positive integers.

But 11 and 101 are co-prime, so m =11, n=101, so m + n = 112.

Wait, but wait, hold on. Because 10^k = 11/101, so k = log_{10}(11/101). Therefore, the value log_{20x}(22x) is equal to log_{10}(11/101), so m =11, n=101, hence m + n = 112.

Wait, but before I jump to conclusion, let me verify.

Because we had k = log_{10}(11/101), which is log_{10}(11) - log_{10}(101). So, in terms of log_{10}(m/n), that is m=11 and n=101, so indeed m + n = 112.

Therefore, the answer is 112.

But just to make sure, let me recapitulate the steps:

1. Set k = log_{20x}(22x) = log_{2x}(202x)
2. Converted both equations into exponential form:
   - (20x)^k = 22x
   - (2x)^k = 202x
3. Divided the first equation by the second to eliminate x^{k -1}, resulting in (20/2)^k = 22/202 => 10^k = 11/101
4. Therefore, k = log_{10}(11/101) = log_{10}(11) - log_{10}(101)
5. So, m=11, n=101, hence m + n=112

Yep, that seems solid. So, I think the answer is 112.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{112}
</think>

Given the equation:

\[
\log_{20x} (22x) = \log_{2x} (202x)
\]

we start by converting the logarithms using the change of base formula. Let \( t = \log x \). The equation becomes:

\[
\frac{\log(22x)}{\log(20x)} = \frac{\log(202x)}{\log(2x)}
\]

Expanding each logarithm, we have:

\[
\frac{\log 22 + \log x}{\log 20 + \log x} = \frac{\log 202 + \log x}{\log 2 + \log x}
\]

Let \( t = \log x \). Substituting \( t \) into the equation, we get:

\[
\frac{\log 22 + t}{\log 20 + t} = \frac{\log 202 + t}{\log 2 + t}
\]

Cross-multiplying gives:

\[
(\log 22 + t)(\log 2 + t) = (\log 202 + t)(\log 20 + t)
\]

Expanding both sides and simplifying, we find:

\[
\log 22 \cdot \log 2 + (\log 22 + \log 2)t + t^2 = \log 202 \cdot \log 20 + (\log 202 + \log 2)t + t^2
\]

Subtracting the right side from the left side, we get:

\[
\log 22 \cdot \log 2 - \log 202 \cdot \log 20 + (\log 22 - \log 202 - \log 2)t = 0
\]

We solve for \( t \) and find that:

\[
10^k = \frac{11}{101}
\]

Taking the logarithm base 10 of both sides, we get:

\[
k = \log_{10} \left( \frac{11}{101} \right)
\]

Thus, the value \( \log_{20x} (22x) \) can be written as \( \log_{10} \left( \frac{11}{101} \right) \). Here, \( m = 11 \) and \( n = 101 \), which are relatively prime. Therefore, \( m + n = 11 + 101 = 112 \).

\[
\boxed{112}
\]
