 The problem: 
The sum of all positive integers $m$ such that $\frac{13!}{m}$ is a perfect square can be written as $2^a3^b5^c7^d11^e13^f,$ where $a,b,c,d,e,$ and $f$ are positive integers. Find $a+b+c+d+e+f.$


Alright, so I have this problem here: I need to find the sum of all positive integers \( m \) such that \( \frac{13!}{m} \) is a perfect square. Then, express that sum in terms of its prime factors, specifically as \( 2^a3^b5^c7^d11^e13^f \), and finally find the sum \( a + b + c + d + e + f \).

Hmm, okay. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that for a number to be a perfect square, all the exponents in its prime factorization must be even. So, if \( \frac{13!}{m} \) is a perfect square, then when I factorize both \( 13! \) and \( m \), the exponents in their ratio must all be even.

So, maybe I should start by finding the prime factorization of \( 13! \). That way, I can see what exponents each prime has, and then figure out what exponents \( m \) must have to make sure that when we divide \( 13! \) by \( m \), all exponents become even.

Right, let's compute the exponents of each prime in \( 13! \). The formula for finding the exponent of a prime \( p \) in \( n! \) is:

\[
\text{Exponent of } p = \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^2} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^3} \right\rfloor + \dots
\]

until \( p^k > n \).

Okay, so let's list the primes up to 13: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13.

Now, let's compute each exponent:

Starting with 2:

- \( \left\lfloor \frac{13}{2} \right\rfloor = 6 \)
- \( \left\lfloor \frac{13}{4} \right\rfloor = 3 \)
- \( \left\lfloor \frac{13}{8} \right\rfloor = 1 \)
- \( \left\lfloor \frac{13}{16} \right\rfloor = 0 \)
Total exponent for 2: 6 + 3 + 1 = 10

Next, 3:

- \( \left\lfloor \frac{13}{3} \right\rfloor = 4 \)
- \( \left\lfloor \frac{13}{9} \right\rfloor = 1 \)
- \( \left\lfloor \frac{13}{27} \right\rfloor = 0 \)
Total exponent for 3: 4 + 1 = 5

Then, 5:

- \( \left\lfloor \frac{13}{5} \right\rfloor = 2 \)
- \( \left\lfloor \frac{13}{25} \right\rfloor = 0 \)
Total exponent for 5: 2

Next, 7:

- \( \left\lfloor \frac{13}{7} \right\rfloor = 1 \)
- \( \left\lfloor \frac{13}{49} \right\rfloor = 0 \)
Total exponent for 7: 1

Similarly, for 11:

- \( \left\lfloor \frac{13}{11} \right\rfloor = 1 \)
- Higher powers would exceed 13, so exponent is 1.

And for 13:

- \( \left\lfloor \frac{13}{13} \right\rfloor = 1 \)
- Next power is 169, which is beyond 13, so exponent is 1.

So summarizing, the prime factorization of \( 13! \) is:

\( 2^{10} \times 3^5 \times 5^2 \times 7^1 \times 11^1 \times 13^1 \)

Cool, got that. Now, we want \( \frac{13!}{m} \) to be a perfect square. So, \( m \) must be such that when you divide \( 13! \) by \( m \), all exponents in the resulting prime factorization are even.

Which means, for each prime in \( m \), the exponent must adjust the exponent in \( 13! \) to an even number.

Let me think about how \( m \) must look.

Since \( m \) divides \( 13! \), it can only have primes present in \( 13! \), i.e., 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13.

For each prime, the exponent in \( m \) can be at most equal to the exponent in \( 13! \). But more importantly, after dividing \( 13! \) by \( m \), each exponent must be even. Therefore, the exponent of each prime in \( m \) must be congruent to the exponent in \( 13! \) modulo 2.

Wait, actually, no. Because if the exponent in \( 13! \) is already even, then \( m \) can take either an even or odd exponent (but not exceeding the exponent in \( 13! \)), but wait, no. Wait, if the exponent in \( 13! \) is even, then \( m \) must have an even exponent as well? Hmm, perhaps.

Wait, maybe it's better to consider separately whether the exponent in \( 13! \) is even or odd.

Let me rephrase: For each prime \( p \), the exponent in \( 13! \) is \( e_p \). We need \( e_p - f_p \) to be even, where \( f_p \) is the exponent of \( p \) in \( m \). So \( f_p \equiv e_p \mod 2 \). Therefore, \( f_p \) must have the same parity as \( e_p \).

Therefore, for each prime \( p \), the exponent \( f_p \) in \( m \) must satisfy:

- If \( e_p \) is even, \( f_p \) must be even as well (since subtracting an even from an even gives even).
- If \( e_p \) is odd, \( f_p \) must be odd as well (since subtracting an odd from an odd gives even).

Moreover, \( f_p \) must satisfy \( 0 \leq f_p \leq e_p \).

Thus, for each prime, depending on whether \( e_p \) is even or odd, the exponent in \( m \) can range over certain values.

So, now, let's go back to our specific case:

Primes in \( 13! \): 2,3,5,7,11,13.

Their exponents:

- 2: 10 (even)
- 3: 5 (odd)
- 5: 2 (even)
- 7: 1 (odd)
- 11: 1 (odd)
- 13: 1 (odd)

So, for each prime:

1. **Prime 2**: exponent 10 (even). So, \( f_2 \) must be even, and \( 0 \leq f_2 \leq 10 \). Therefore, possible exponents: 0,2,4,6,8,10. That's 6 choices.

2. **Prime 3**: exponent 5 (odd). So, \( f_3 \) must be odd, and \( 0 \leq f_3 \leq 5 \). So, possible exponents: 1,3,5. That's 3 choices.

3. **Prime 5**: exponent 2 (even). So, \( f_5 \) must be even, and \( 0 \leq f_5 \leq 2 \). Possible exponents: 0,2. That's 2 choices.

4. **Prime 7**: exponent 1 (odd). So, \( f_7 \) must be odd, and \( 0 \leq f_7 \leq 1 \). So, possible exponents: 1. That's 1 choice.

5. **Prime 11**: exponent 1 (odd). Similarly, \( f_{11} \) must be odd, so only 1. 1 choice.

6. **Prime 13**: exponent 1 (odd). Same as above, \( f_{13} \) must be 1. 1 choice.

Hence, the total number of such \( m \) is the product of the number of choices for each exponent: 6 * 3 * 2 * 1 * 1 * 1 = 6*3*2=36.

But wait, actually, no. Wait, each choice for each exponent is independent, so yes, the total number is 6*3*2*1*1*1=36. So, 36 different \( m \) such that \( 13!/m \) is a perfect square.

However, the question isn't asking for the number, but the sum of all such \( m \). Hmm, okay, so we need to compute the sum over all possible \( m \) constructed by choosing exponents as per above.

So, to find the sum, we can model it as a product of sums for each prime. Since each exponent is independent, the total sum is the product of the sums for each prime's exponents.

That is, for each prime \( p \), with exponent choices \( f_p \), the sum contributed by that prime is \( \sum_{k \in S_p} p^{k} \), where \( S_p \) is the set of allowed exponents for \( p \).

Therefore, the total sum is the product of these individual sums for each prime.

So, let's compute this step by step.

1. **Prime 2**: Exponent choices: 0,2,4,6,8,10.

So, the sum contributed by 2 is:

\( 2^0 + 2^2 + 2^4 + 2^6 + 2^8 + 2^{10} \)

Calculate this:

1 + 4 + 16 + 64 + 256 + 1024

Let me compute this:

1 + 4 = 5

5 + 16 = 21

21 + 64 = 85

85 + 256 = 341

341 + 1024 = 1365

So, sum for 2 is 1365.

2. **Prime 3**: Exponent choices: 1,3,5.

Sum contributed by 3:

\( 3^1 + 3^3 + 3^5 \)

Compute:

3 + 27 + 243

3 + 27 = 30

30 + 243 = 273

So, sum for 3 is 273.

3. **Prime 5**: Exponent choices: 0,2.

Sum contributed by 5:

\( 5^0 + 5^2 \)

Compute:

1 + 25 = 26

Sum for 5 is 26.

4. **Prime 7**: Exponent choices: 1.

Sum contributed by 7:

\( 7^1 = 7 \)

5. **Prime 11**: Exponent choices: 1.

Sum contributed by 11:

\( 11^1 = 11 \)

6. **Prime 13**: Exponent choices: 1.

Sum contributed by 13:

\( 13^1 = 13 \)

Therefore, the total sum is the product of all these individual sums:

Total Sum = 1365 * 273 * 26 * 7 * 11 * 13

Whoa, that seems like a big multiplication. Let's tackle this step by step.

First, let's note that 1365, 273, 26, 7, 11, 13 are all numbers we can factor further, but since the final expression is supposed to be in terms of prime factors, maybe it's easier to multiply them step by step while keeping track of the prime factors.

Alternatively, since we might end up with exponents in the final product, let me see.

Wait, but actually, since the total sum is going to be a product of several numbers, each of which is a sum of powers of primes, when we multiply them together, the result will have prime factors corresponding to all the primes involved in the initial factorials, each raised to some exponent.

Wait, but perhaps another approach is, instead of multiplying all these big numbers together, to keep track of the exponents for each prime as they contribute to the total sum.

But that sounds complicated because each term in the product is a sum over different exponents, so when multiplied, cross terms will create combinations.

Wait, maybe it's better to compute the total sum step by step.

Alternatively, note that each sum is multiplicative, so perhaps we can compute the product incrementally, simplifying as we go.

Let me try that.

Start with 1365.

First, 1365 * 273.

Compute 1365 * 273.

Well, 1365 * 273.

We can do this by breaking down 273 into 200 + 70 + 3.

So,

1365 * 200 = 273,000

1365 * 70 = 95,550

1365 * 3 = 4,095

Add them up:

273,000 + 95,550 = 368,550

368,550 + 4,095 = 372,645

So, 1365 * 273 = 372,645.

Next, multiply 372,645 by 26.

Compute 372,645 * 26.

Breakdown 26 into 20 + 6.

372,645 * 20 = 7,452,900

372,645 * 6 = 2,235,870

Add them:

7,452,900 + 2,235,870 = 9,688,770

So, 372,645 * 26 = 9,688,770.

Next, multiply 9,688,770 by 7.

9,688,770 * 7 = 67,821,390

Then, multiply 67,821,390 by 11.

Multiply 67,821,390 * 11.

This is equal to 67,821,390 + 678,213,900 = 746,035,290

Wait, hold on. Wait, 67,821,390 * 10 = 678,213,900

Plus 67,821,390 gives 678,213,900 + 67,821,390 = 746,035,290.

Yes, correct.

Finally, multiply 746,035,290 by 13.

Compute 746,035,290 * 13.

Break down 13 into 10 + 3.

746,035,290 * 10 = 7,460,352,900

746,035,290 * 3 = 2,238,105,870

Add them:

7,460,352,900 + 2,238,105,870

Compute:

7,460,352,900 + 2,238,105,870

Let's add:

7,460,352,900

+2,238,105,870

= 9,698,458,770

Wait, let me verify:

7,460,352,900

+2,238,105,870

Adding units:

0 + 0 = 0

0 + 0 = 0

9 + 7 = 16, carryover 1

2 + 8 + 1 = 11, carryover 1

5 + 5 + 1 = 11, carryover 1

3 + 0 + 1 = 4

6 + 1 = 7

4 + 2 = 6

7 + nothing =7

Wait, perhaps my mental addition is off. Maybe it's better to add them numerically.

7,460,352,900

+2,238,105,870

= ?

Starting from the right:

0 + 0 = 0

0 + 0 = 0

9 + 7 = 16, write down 6, carryover 1

2 + 8 + 1 = 11, write down 1, carryover 1

5 + 5 + 1 = 11, write down 1, carryover 1

3 + 0 + 1 = 4

6 + 1 = 7

4 + 2 = 6

7 + 2 = 9

So, putting it together: 9,698,458,770.

Yes, that seems correct.

So, the total sum is 9,698,458,770.

Wait, but that's the numerical value. However, the problem asks for expressing this sum as \( 2^a3^b5^c7^d11^e13^f \), so we need the prime factorization of this number.

Wow, okay, so I need to factor 9,698,458,770 into its prime components.

Given that it's a huge number, factoring it might be challenging, but perhaps there's a smarter way.

Wait, remember that earlier, we expressed the total sum as the product of sums for each prime. Each sum is itself a product of terms. Maybe we can factor each sum first before multiplying everything together.

Looking back:

Total Sum = 1365 * 273 * 26 * 7 * 11 * 13

Let me factor each of these numbers into their prime factors:

1. 1365: Let's factor this.

1365 ÷ 5 = 273. So, 5 is a factor.

273 ÷ 3 = 91. So, 3 is a factor.

91 ÷ 7 = 13. So, 7 and 13 are factors.

Thus, 1365 = 5 * 3 * 7 * 13

2. 273: As above, 273 = 3 * 7 * 13

3. 26: 26 = 2 * 13

4. 7: Prime

5. 11: Prime

6. 13: Prime

So, rewriting the Total Sum:

(5 * 3 * 7 * 13) * (3 * 7 * 13) * (2 * 13) * 7 * 11 * 13

Now, let's combine all these factors:

First, list all the prime factors:

From 1365: 5, 3, 7, 13

From 273: 3, 7, 13

From 26: 2, 13

From 7: 7

From 11: 11

From 13: 13

Now, count the exponents for each prime:

- 2: appears once (from 26)
- 3: appears twice (once from 1365, once from 273)
- 5: appears once (from 1365)
- 7: appears four times (once from 1365, once from 273, once from 26, and once alone)
- 11: appears once
- 13: appears four times (once from 1365, once from 273, once from 26, once alone)

Wait, let me recount:

From 1365: 5, 3, 7, 13 → counts: 3 once, 5 once, 7 once, 13 once.

From 273: 3, 7, 13 → counts: 3 once, 7 once, 13 once.

From 26: 2, 13 → counts: 2 once, 13 once.

From 7: 7 → counts: 7 once.

From 11: 11 → counts: 11 once.

From 13: 13 → counts: 13 once.

So, adding them up:

- 2: 1
- 3: 1 (1365) + 1 (273) = 2
- 5: 1
- 7: 1 (1365) + 1 (273) + 1 (26) + 1 (7 alone) = 4
- 11: 1
- 13: 1 (1365) + 1 (273) + 1 (26) + 1 (13 alone) = 4

Therefore, the prime factorization of the total sum is:

\( 2^1 \times 3^2 \times 5^1 \times 7^4 \times 11^1 \times 13^4 \)

So, exponents are:

a = 1 (for 2)

b = 2 (for 3)

c = 1 (for 5)

d = 4 (for 7)

e = 1 (for 11)

f = 4 (for 13)

Therefore, adding them up: 1 + 2 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 13.

Wait, hold on, 1+2 is 3, plus 1 is 4, plus 4 is 8, plus 1 is 9, plus 4 is 13.

So, the sum \( a + b + c + d + e + f = 13 \).

But just to make sure, let me double-check my reasoning.

Earlier, when calculating the total sum, I computed the product as 9,698,458,770. Then, trying to factor that number directly might be time-consuming, but alternatively, since I broke down each component into their prime factors and combined them, I think that approach is solid.

Each of the sums (like 1365, 273, etc.) were broken down into their prime components, and then I just added up the exponents across all primes. So, that method should give the correct exponents without having to deal with the massive number.

Therefore, I feel confident that the exponents are indeed a=1, b=2, c=1, d=4, e=1, f=4, leading to a sum of 13.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{13}
</think>

To solve the problem, we need to find the sum of all positive integers \( m \) such that \( \frac{13!}{m} \) is a perfect square. We then express this sum in terms of its prime factors and find the sum of the exponents.

First, we determine the prime factorization of \( 13! \):

\[
13! = 2^{10} \times 3^5 \times 5^2 \times 7^1 \times 11^1 \times 13^1
\]

For \( \frac{13!}{m} \) to be a perfect square, the exponents in the resulting prime factorization must be even. This means the exponents in \( m \) must adjust the exponents in \( 13! \) to make them even. 

We analyze the exponents for each prime:
- **Prime 2**: Exponent 10 (even). \( f_2 \) must be even (0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10).
- **Prime 3**: Exponent 5 (odd). \( f_3 \) must be odd (1, 3, 5).
- **Prime 5**: Exponent 2 (even). \( f_5 \) must be even (0, 2).
- **Prime 7**: Exponent 1 (odd). \( f_7 \) must be odd (1).
- **Prime 11**: Exponent 1 (odd). \( f_{11} \) must be odd (1).
- **Prime 13**: Exponent 1 (odd). \( f_{13} \) must be odd (1).

The number of choices for each prime's exponent:
- Prime 2: 6 choices
- Prime 3: 3 choices
- Prime 5: 2 choices
- Prime 7: 1 choice
- Prime 11: 1 choice
- Prime 13: 1 choice

The total number of such \( m \) is \( 6 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 \times 1 \times 1 = 36 \).

Next, we calculate the sum of all such \( m \). This is done by considering the sum of each prime's contributions, which are independent. The sum for each prime is:
- **Prime 2**: \( 2^0 + 2^2 + 2^4 + 2^6 + 2^8 + 2^{10} = 1365 \)
- **Prime 3**: \( 3^1 + 3^3 + 3^5 = 273 \)
- **Prime 5**: \( 5^0 + 5^2 = 26 \)
- **Prime 7**: \( 7^1 = 7 \)
- **Prime 11**: \( 11^1 = 11 \)
- **Prime 13**: \( 13^1 = 13 \)

The total sum is the product of these sums:
\[
1365 \times 273 \times 26 \times 7 \times 11 \times 13
\]

Factoring each component:
- \( 1365 = 5 \times 3 \times 7 \times 13 \)
- \( 273 = 3 \times 7 \times 13 \)
- \( 26 = 2 \times 13 \)
- \( 7, 11, 13 \) are primes

Combining all factors:
- \( 2^1 \times 3^2 \times 5^1 \times 7^4 \times 11^1 \times 13^4 \)

Summing the exponents:
\[
a + b + c + d + e + f = 1 + 2 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 13
\]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{13}
\]
