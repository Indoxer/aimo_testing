 The problem: 
For any finite set $X$, let $| X |$ denote the number of elements in $X$. Define
\[S_n = \sum | A \cap B | ,\]
where the sum is taken over all ordered pairs $(A, B)$ such that $A$ and $B$ are subsets of $\left\{ 1 , 2 , 3,  \cdots , n \right\}$ with $|A| = |B|$.
For example, $S_2 = 4$ because the sum is taken over the pairs of subsets
\[(A, B) \in \left\{ (\emptyset, \emptyset) , ( \{1\} , \{1\} ), ( \{1\} , \{2\} ) , ( \{2\} , \{1\} ) , ( \{2\} , \{2\} ) , ( \{1 , 2\} , \{1 , 2\} ) \right\} ,\]
giving $S_2 = 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 2 = 4$.
Let $\frac{S_{2022}}{S_{2021}} = \frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find the remainder when $p + q$ is divided by
1000.


To solve for \( S_n \), we start by considering the sum \( S_n = \sum |A \cap B| \) over all ordered pairs \((A, B)\) such that \( A \) and \( B \) are subsets of \(\{1, 2, \ldots, n\}\) with \( |A| = |B| \). We will count the contribution of each element \( i \) to the sum \( S_n \).

For a fixed element \( i \), the number of subsets \( A \) containing \( i \) is \( 2^{n-1} \) (since we can either include or exclude each of the other \( n-1 \) elements). Similarly, the number of subsets \( B \) containing \( i \) is also \( 2^{n-1} \). Therefore, the number of ordered pairs \((A, B)\) such that both \( A \) and \( B \) contain \( i \) is \( 2^{n-1} \times 2^{n-1} = 2^{2(n-1)} \).

Since there are \( n \) elements in the set, and each element contributes \( 2^{2(n-1)} \) to the sum \( S_n \), we have:
\[
S_n = n \cdot 2^{2(n-1)}
\]

Now, we need to find \( \frac{S_{2022}}{S_{2021}} \):
\[
\frac{S_{2022}}{S_{2021}} = \frac{2022 \cdot 2^{2(2022-1)}}{2021 \cdot 2^{2(2021-1)}} = \frac{2022 \cdot 2^{2 \cdot 2021}}{2021 \cdot 2^{2 \cdot 2020}} = \frac{2022 \cdot 2^2}{2021} = \frac{2022 \cdot 4}{2021} = \frac{8088}{2021}
\]

We need to simplify \( \frac{8088}{2021} \). Since 8088 and 2021 are relatively prime, the fraction is already in its simplest form. Therefore, \( p = 8088 \) and \( q = 2021 \).

Finally, we need to find the remainder when \( p + q = 8088 + 2021 = 10109 \) is divided by 1000:
\[
10109 \mod 1000 = 109
\]

Thus, the remainder is \(\boxed{109}\).
