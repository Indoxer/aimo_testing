 The problem: 
Let $w = \dfrac{\sqrt{3} + i}{2}$ and $z = \dfrac{-1 + i\sqrt{3}}{2},$ where $i = \sqrt{-1}.$ Find the number of ordered pairs $(r,s)$ of positive integers not exceeding $100$ that satisfy the equation $i \cdot w^r = z^s.$


To solve the problem, we start by expressing \(w\) and \(z\) in polar form. First, we note that \(w = \dfrac{\sqrt{3} + i}{2}\) can be written as \(w = \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{6}\right) + i\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{6}\right) = e^{i\pi/6}\). Similarly, \(z = \dfrac{-1 + i\sqrt{3}}{2}\) can be written as \(z = \cos\left(\frac{2\pi}{3}\right) + i\sin\left(\frac{2\pi}{3}\right) = e^{i2\pi/3}\).

Given the equation \(i \cdot w^r = z^s\), we substitute the polar forms of \(w\) and \(z\):
\[i \cdot e^{i\pi/6 \cdot r} = e^{i2\pi/3 \cdot s}.\]
Since \(i = e^{i\pi/2}\), we can rewrite the equation as:
\[e^{i\pi/2} \cdot e^{i\pi/6 \cdot r} = e^{i2\pi/3 \cdot s},\]
which simplifies to:
\[e^{i(\pi/2 + \pi/6 \cdot r)} = e^{i2\pi/3 \cdot s}.\]
This implies that the exponents must differ by an integer multiple of \(2\pi\):
\[\frac{\pi}{2} + \frac{\pi}{6}r = \frac{2\pi}{3}s + 2k\pi \quad \text{for some integer } k.\]
Dividing through by \(\pi\), we get:
\[\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{6}r = \frac{2}{3}s + 2k.\]
Multiplying through by 6 to clear the denominators, we obtain:
\[3 + r = 4s + 12k.\]
Rearranging terms, we have:
\[r = 4s + 12k - 3.\]
We need \(r\) and \(s\) to be positive integers not exceeding 100. Therefore, \(s\) can take any integer value from 1 to 25 (since if \(s = 26\), then \(r = 4 \cdot 26 + 12k - 3 = 101 + 12k > 100\)). For each \(s\), \(r\) is determined uniquely as long as \(1 \leq r \leq 100\). This means:
\[1 \leq 4s + 12k - 3 \leq 100,\]
or equivalently,
\[4 \leq 4s + 12k \leq 103.\]
Dividing through by 4, we get:
\[1 \leq s + 3k \leq 25.75.\]
Since \(s\) and \(k\) are integers, we have:
\[1 \leq s + 3k \leq 25.\]
For each fixed \(s\) from 1 to 25, \(k\) can take any integer value such that \(1 \leq s + 3k \leq 25\). This gives us:
\[k = \left\lceil \frac{1-s}{3} \right\rceil, \left\lfloor \frac{25-s}{3} \right\rfloor.\]
The number of possible values for \(k\) is:
\[\left\lfloor \frac{25-s}{3} \right\rfloor - \left\lceil \frac{1-s}{3} \right\rceil + 1.\]
For \(s = 1\), \(k\) ranges from 0 to 8 (9 values).
For \(s = 2\), \(k\) ranges from 0 to 7 (8 values).
For \(s = 3\), \(k\) ranges from 0 to 7 (8 values).
...
For \(s = 25\), \(k\) ranges from 0 to 0 (1 value).
The total number of ordered pairs \((r, s)\) is the sum of the number of values for \(k\) for each \(s\):
\[9 + 8 \times 24 + 1 = 217.\]
Thus, the number of ordered pairs \((r, s)\) is \(\boxed{217}\).
