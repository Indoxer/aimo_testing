 The problem: 
Let $w = \dfrac{\sqrt{3} + i}{2}$ and $z = \dfrac{-1 + i\sqrt{3}}{2},$ where $i = \sqrt{-1}.$ Find the number of ordered pairs $(r,s)$ of positive integers not exceeding $100$ that satisfy the equation $i \cdot w^r = z^s.$


To solve the problem, we start by expressing \(w\) and \(z\) in polar form. The complex number \(w = \dfrac{\sqrt{3} + i}{2}\) can be written as \(w = e^{i\pi/6}\) because its magnitude is 1 and its argument is \(\pi/6\). Similarly, the complex number \(z = \dfrac{-1 + i\sqrt{3}}{2}\) can be written as \(z = e^{i2\pi/3}\) because its magnitude is 1 and its argument is \(2\pi/3\).

Given the equation \(i \cdot w^r = z^s\), we substitute the polar forms of \(w\) and \(z\):
\[i \cdot e^{i\pi/6 \cdot r} = e^{i2\pi/3 \cdot s}.\]
We know that \(i = e^{i\pi/2}\), so the equation becomes:
\[e^{i\pi/2} \cdot e^{i\pi/6 \cdot r} = e^{i2\pi/3 \cdot s}.\]
Using the properties of exponents, we combine the terms on the left side:
\[e^{i(\pi/2 + \pi/6 \cdot r)} = e^{i2\pi/3 \cdot s}.\]
Since the exponents must be equal up to an integer multiple of \(2\pi i\), we have:
\[\frac{\pi}{2} + \frac{\pi}{6} r = \frac{2\pi}{3} s + 2k\pi \quad \text{for some integer } k.\]
Dividing through by \(\pi\), we get:
\[\frac{1}{2} + \frac{r}{6} = \frac{2s}{3} + 2k.\]
Multiplying through by 6 to clear the denominators, we obtain:
\[3 + r = 4s + 12k.\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[r = 4s + 12k - 3.\]
We need \(r\) and \(s\) to be positive integers not exceeding 100. Therefore, we need to find all pairs \((r, s)\) such that \(1 \leq r \leq 100\) and \(1 \leq s \leq 100\).

First, we determine the range of \(s\). Since \(r = 4s + 12k - 3\) and \(1 \leq r \leq 100\), we have:
\[1 \leq 4s + 12k - 3 \leq 100.\]
Adding 3 to all parts of the inequality, we get:
\[4 \leq 4s + 12k \leq 103.\]
Dividing through by 4, we obtain:
\[1 \leq s + 3k \leq 25.75.\]
Since \(s\) and \(k\) are integers, we have:
\[1 \leq s + 3k \leq 25.\]
This means \(s\) can take any integer value from 1 to 25. For each fixed \(s\), \(k\) must be chosen such that \(1 \leq 4s + 12k - 3 \leq 100\), which simplifies to:
\[1 \leq 4s + 12k - 3 \leq 100 \implies 1 \leq 4s + 12k - 3 \implies 4s + 12k \geq 4 \implies s + 3k \geq 1.\]
Since \(s + 3k \leq 25\), \(k\) can take any integer value from 0 up to \(\left\lfloor \frac{25 - s}{3} \right\rfloor\). Therefore, for each \(s\) from 1 to 25, there are \(\left\lfloor \frac{25 - s}{3} \right\rfloor + 1\) possible values for \(k\).

Summing these possibilities, we get:
\[
\sum_{s=1}^{25} \left( \left\lfloor \frac{25 - s}{3} \right\rfloor + 1 \right).
\]
We can break this sum into parts based on the value of \(\left\lfloor \frac{25 - s}{3} \right\rfloor\):
- For \(s = 1, 2, 3\), \(\left\lfloor \frac{25 - s}{3} \right\rfloor = 8\).
- For \(s = 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\), \(\left\lfloor \frac{25 - s}{3} \right\rfloor = 7\).
- For \(s = 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14\), \(\left\lfloor \frac{25 - s}{3} \right\rfloor = 6\).
- For \(s = 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21\), \(\left\lfloor \frac{25 - s}{3} \right\rfloor = 4\).
- For \(s = 22, 23, 24, 25\), \(\left\lfloor \frac{25 - s}{3} \right\rfloor = 1\).

Thus, the total number of ordered pairs \((r, s)\) is:
\[3 \cdot 8 + 5 \cdot 7 + 6 \cdot 6 + 7 \cdot 4 + 4 \cdot 1 = 24 + 35 + 36 + 28 + 4 = 127.\]

Therefore, the number of ordered pairs \((r, s)\) is \(\boxed{127}\).
