 The problem: 
Find the number of collections of $16$ distinct subsets of $\{1,2,3,4,5\}$ with the property that for any two subsets $X$ and $Y$ in the collection, $X \cap Y \not= \emptyset.$


<think>
Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of collections of 16 distinct subsets of the set {1,2,3,4,5}. The key condition is that for any two subsets X and Y in the collection, their intersection isn't empty. Hmm, interesting. Let me try to break this down.

First, let's understand what exactly is being asked here. We're dealing with subsets of a 5-element set, so each subset can be represented as a binary string of length 5, where each bit indicates the presence (1) or absence (0) of an element in the subset. There are 2^5 = 32 possible subsets in total.

Now, we need collections of 16 subsets. So, it's half of all possible subsets. But there's a catch: any two subsets in this collection must intersect; they can't be disjoint. That seems like a significant restriction.

I remember something about antichains in combinatorics. An antichain is a collection of sets where no one set is a subset of another. But wait, in this case, we don't have such a condition. Instead, we have the opposite: every pair must intersect. So, perhaps this is more related to the concept of intersecting families.

Yes, intersecting families! In extremal set theory, an intersecting family is a set system where any two sets share at least one common element. That fits perfectly with the problem statement.

So, the question is essentially asking: How many intersecting families of size 16 exist on a 5-element set?

But hold on, actually, it's not just the number of such families, but the number of collections. So, it's about counting how many different ways we can choose 16 subsets from the 32 available, such that any two chosen subsets intersect.

Hmm, okay. Maybe I should recall some theorems related to intersecting families. The classic result here is the Erdos-Ko-Rado theorem, which gives the maximum size of a k-uniform intersecting family. However, in our case, the subsets aren't necessarily of the same size, so maybe that theorem isn't directly applicable.

Wait, but the EKR theorem does say that for intersecting families, the maximum size is C(n-1,k-1), when n >= 2k. But again, since our subsets can be of any size, not just a fixed size, perhaps that complicates things.

Alternatively, maybe I can think about the complement problem. Each subset can be represented as a vector in a 5-dimensional vector space over the field GF(2). Then, the condition that any two subsets intersect translates to their corresponding vectors not being orthogonal—meaning their dot product isn't zero. Hmm, interesting. Is that useful?

Wait, actually, thinking in terms of linear algebra might not be straightforward because orthogonality in GF(2) is different from standard dot products. Maybe that approach is too convoluted.

Let me step back. If I have 16 subsets, each of them has to intersect with every other. So, if I fix an element, say element 1, and consider all subsets that contain 1, then any two such subsets will definitely intersect at 1. Similarly, if I fix another element, say element 2, and take all subsets containing 2, those also form an intersecting family. 

But in our case, we need 16 subsets, which is quite large. Since the total number of subsets containing a fixed element is 16 (since for each of the other 4 elements, they can be present or not). Wait, hold on: the number of subsets containing a particular element is indeed 2^(n-1) = 16 in this case, since n=5.

So, if we fix an element, say 1, then the family of all subsets containing 1 has exactly 16 subsets. Moreover, any two subsets in this family intersect because they both contain 1. Therefore, this is an intersecting family of size 16.

Similarly, fixing any other single element would give another intersecting family of size 16. But wait, the problem says "collections of 16 distinct subsets", so these are specific collections. So, each such family corresponds to choosing all subsets that contain a particular element.

But could there be other intersecting families of size 16? Or is this the only way?

Wait, suppose we have a family that doesn't fix a single element but still ensures that every two subsets intersect. For example, suppose we take all subsets that contain either element 1 or element 2. Would that work? Well, let's see: if you have a subset containing 1 and one containing 2, do they necessarily intersect? Not unless they both contain 1 or both contain 2. So, if a subset contains 1 but not 2, and another contains 2 but not 1, their intersection is empty. Therefore, such a family wouldn't satisfy the intersecting condition.

Hence, it's necessary that all subsets in the family contain a common element. Otherwise, you can have subsets that avoid each other. So, that suggests that the only maximal intersecting families (in terms of size) are those that fix a single element. But wait, the problem allows any collection of 16 subsets, not necessarily maximal.

Wait, but 16 is exactly half of the total number of subsets, which is 32. So, if we fix an element, say 1, the family of all subsets containing 1 is size 16, and any two subsets in this family intersect. Similarly, the family of all subsets not containing 1 is also size 16, but wait, those subsets are pairwise disjoint because none of them contain 1. So, that family doesn't satisfy the intersecting condition. Hence, only the family of subsets containing a fixed element gives an intersecting family.

Therefore, the only intersecting families of size 16 are those that consist of all subsets containing a particular element. Since there are 5 elements, each can be the fixed element. Thus, there are 5 such families.

Wait, but hold on. Are these the only ones? Could there be other families of size 16 that aren't fixing a single element but still ensuring intersection?

Suppose I take two different fixed elements, say 1 and 2, and then include all subsets containing 1 or 2. But as I thought earlier, that family includes subsets that may not intersect. For instance, a subset containing only 1 and a subset containing only 2 would be disjoint. Hence, that family doesn't satisfy the intersecting condition.

Alternatively, what if I fix two overlapping elements? Like, for example, fix subsets that contain either 1 or 2, but ensure that they also contain some other element. Wait, but then you might end up excluding some subsets. It's getting complicated.

Alternatively, maybe using inclusion-exclusion principles or considering the structure of the power set.

Wait, another idea: think about the dual problem. Each subset can be identified with its characteristic vector. Then, the condition that any two subsets intersect is equivalent to saying that no two characteristic vectors are orthogonal, i.e., their dot product is non-zero. But wait, in GF(2), the dot product is mod 2, so actually, non-zero would mean the dot product is 1.

But even so, how does that help? Maybe not much.

Wait, perhaps another angle: the family of subsets forms a hypergraph where every edge intersects. So, we're looking for a hypergraph with 16 edges where every pair of edges intersects. Such a hypergraph is called an intersecting hypergraph.

In hypergraph terminology, an intersecting hypergraph is one where any two edges share at least one vertex. So, yes, that's exactly our case.

And now, the question reduces to: how many intersecting hypergraphs with 16 edges are there on a 5-vertex set?

But that's a bit abstract. Maybe going back to the basics.

We know that in order to have all subsets intersect, they must all share at least one common element. Because otherwise, if they don't all share a common element, there must be two subsets that don't share any element.

Is that true? Suppose not all subsets contain a common element. Then, by the pigeonhole principle, there exists two subsets that don't share any element. Wait, is that necessarily true?

Wait, actually, no. For example, consider three subsets: {1,2}, {2,3}, {3,4}. None of them share a common element, but they don't all pairwise intersect. Wait, but in our case, we require that every pair intersects, so that example wouldn't apply.

Wait, if every pair of subsets in the family must intersect, then it's impossible to have a family where every pair shares at least one element without having all subsets share a common element.

Wait, is that a theorem? Let me recall.

Yes, actually, in set theory, there's a result called the "Erdos-Ko-Rado theorem for intersecting families." But that usually applies to uniform families. However, for non-uniform families, the situation might be different.

Wait, more precisely, if a family of subsets is such that every two subsets intersect, then the family must have a common element. Is that always true?

Wait, no, that's not necessarily true. Consider the family consisting of all subsets that contain at least two elements. Then, certainly, any two subsets will intersect because each has at least two elements, but they don't necessarily share a common element.

For example, take {1,2} and {3,4}; these two subsets are both in the family, but they don't intersect. Hence, such a family isn't intersecting.

Wait, right, so in that case, the family is not intersecting because although each subset has multiple elements, they can still be disjoint.

Hence, my initial assumption was wrong—that a family where every subset has size at least two is automatically intersecting. It isn't. So, perhaps the conclusion is that the only intersecting families of maximum size are those fixing a common element.

But in our case, the family size is 16, which is equal to the number of subsets containing a fixed element.

Is 16 the maximum size of an intersecting family in the power set of a 5-element set?

Wait, let's check. The total number of subsets is 32. The family of all subsets containing a fixed element has size 16, as we saw. Is it possible to have a larger family where every two subsets intersect?

If we try to add another subset not containing the fixed element, say, the empty set. But the empty set intersects with every subset, including itself (since the empty set is disjoint with itself? Wait, no—the empty set intersects with any non-empty set, but it's disjoint with itself because their intersection is empty.

But in our problem, the subsets are distinct, so the empty set can only appear once. So, adding the empty set to the family would create a pair (the empty set and any other subset) that intersects, but actually, the empty set is disjoint with itself, but since it's only included once, it's okay? Wait, no—if you have the empty set and another subset, their intersection is empty only if the other subset is also empty. But since all subsets are distinct, adding the empty set would make it intersect with all non-empty subsets, which is fine. But actually, wait, no: the empty set is disjoint with every other subset except itself, but since we cannot have duplicate subsets, the empty set is only in the family once. So, in the family, the empty set is allowed, but it's only disjoint with itself, which isn't a problem because we only have one copy.

But hold on, in our problem statement, the subsets are required to be distinct, but nothing is said about them being non-empty. So, the empty set is allowed. However, the family of all subsets containing a fixed element plus the empty set would have size 17. But then, is that family intersecting? Let's see: the empty set intersects with every subset in the family because the empty set's intersection with any non-empty set is empty, but wait—it's not. The empty set and any other subset would have an empty intersection. So, actually, the empty set is disjoint with every other subset in the family. Therefore, adding the empty set would violate the intersecting property because the empty set and any other subset in the family would have an empty intersection.

Thus, the family of all subsets containing a fixed element cannot include the empty set because that would create a disjoint pair. Therefore, the maximum size of an intersecting family is indeed 16, achieved by fixing a single element.

Hence, this tells us that any intersecting family of size 16 must consist of all subsets containing a fixed element. Therefore, the number of such families is equal to the number of choices for that fixed element, which is 5.

Wait, but hold on—is that really the case? Could there be another family of 16 subsets where every pair intersects, but they don't all share a common element? If not, then 5 is the correct answer.

Earlier, I considered whether taking all subsets containing either of two elements would work, but realized that it doesn't because you can have subsets containing only the first or only the second element, which are disjoint. So, that family isn't intersecting.

Another idea: suppose instead of fixing a single element, you fix a pair of elements. Then, all subsets containing at least one of the pair. But wait, that family might not have all subsets intersecting. For example, a subset containing only the first element and another containing only the second element would be disjoint. So, that family isn't intersecting either.

Alternatively, fix two elements and require all subsets to contain both. Then, the family would consist of all subsets containing both elements. The size of such a family would be 2^(5-2) = 8, which is less than 16. Hence, too small.

Alternatively, fix a single element and take all subsets containing it, which is 16. Alternatively, fix a pair and take all subsets containing at least one of them, but as before, that family isn't intersecting.

Alternatively, fix a triple and require subsets to contain at least one element of the triple. But then, similar issues arise where subsets can avoid certain elements.

Wait, another thought: perhaps use inclusion properties. For example, if all subsets contain at least one of a certain set of elements, but arranged such that any two subsets must share at least one. But I don't think that would cover the entire family unless it's the entire family of subsets containing a single element.

Wait, perhaps another angle: the concept of a filter in order theory. A filter is a family of sets where if a set is in the family and it's a subset of another set, then that superset is also in the family. But I'm not sure if that helps here.

Alternatively, think about the complement. The complement of an intersecting family is a family where every two subsets have a union equal to the entire set. Wait, no, the complement would have subsets whose complements don't intersect, meaning their complements are disjoint. So, if the original family is intersecting, the complement family has the property that every two subsets are disjoint. Such a family is called an antichain in some contexts, but actually, it's a family where every two subsets are disjoint, which is called a "clutter" or "antichain," but I'm not sure.

Wait, regardless, the point is, if I take the complements, I get a family of 16 subsets where every two subsets are disjoint. How many such families are there?

Well, the number of ways to partition the 5-element set into two parts, one part being the subsets. Wait, but in our case, each subset is unique, so perhaps this is related to the concept of a matching.

But perhaps not. Wait, if every two subsets in the complement family are disjoint, then each subset in the complement family must be a singleton? No, not necessarily, because in a 5-element set, you can have larger subsets as long as they don't overlap.

Wait, actually, in a 5-element set, the maximum number of pairwise disjoint subsets is 5 (each singleton). But our complement family has 16 subsets, which is much larger. Hence, that approach might not work.

Wait, perhaps another direction: since each pair of subsets must intersect, the family is an intersecting family. Now, the question is, how many such families of size 16 exist.

From previous reasoning, it seems that the only possibility is that all subsets contain a fixed element. Because any other structure would allow for two subsets that don't intersect.

Therefore, the number of such families is equal to the number of elements in the original set, which is 5. Hence, the answer is 5.

But wait, hold on, just to make sure, let me consider another scenario. Suppose I fix two elements, say 1 and 2, and take all subsets that contain at least one of them. As I thought before, this family has size 2^5 - 2^(5-2) = 32 - 8 = 24. But in this family, some subsets contain only 1, others only 2, and some contain both. However, subsets that contain only 1 and subsets that contain only 2 are disjoint. Hence, this family isn't intersecting. So, that doesn't work.

Alternatively, if I fix two elements, and take all subsets that contain both. Then, the family size is 2^(5-2) = 8, which is less than 16. So, not enough.

Alternatively, fix a single element, take all subsets containing it, which gives 16. Alternatively, fix another single element, giving another family. So, these are the only possibilities.

Therefore, it's convincing that the only intersecting families of size 16 are the ones where all subsets contain a fixed element, and since there are 5 elements, there are 5 such families.

Therefore, the number of collections is 5.

**Final Answer**
The number of such collections is \boxed{5}.
</think>

To solve the problem of finding the number of collections of 16 distinct subsets of \(\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}\) such that any two subsets \(X\) and \(Y\) in the collection intersect (i.e., \(X \cap Y \neq \emptyset\)), we need to consider the concept of intersecting families in combinatorics.

An intersecting family is a collection of sets where any two sets share at least one common element. For a 5-element set, each subset can be represented as a binary string of length 5. The total number of subsets is \(2^5 = 32\).

We need to find collections of 16 subsets. The key insight is that the largest intersecting family on a 5-element set consists of all subsets containing a fixed element. Fixing an element, say \(1\), results in \(2^{5-1} = 16\) subsets, each containing \(1\). Any two subsets in this family will intersect because they both contain the fixed element.

It is important to note that any other structure for the family of subsets would not guarantee intersection. For example, fixing multiple elements or considering subsets that do not all contain a single element would allow for disjoint pairs, violating the intersecting condition.

Thus, the only way to form an intersecting family of size 16 is to fix a single element and include all subsets containing that element. There are 5 elements in the set \(\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}\), each of which can be the fixed element. Therefore, there are 5 such families.

Hence, the number of collections of 16 distinct subsets with the given property is \(\boxed{5}\).
