 The problem: 
Recall that a palindrome is a number that reads the same forward and backward. Find the greatest integer less than $1000$ that is a palindrome both when written in base ten and when written in base eight, such as $292 = 444_{\text{eight}}.$


Alright, so I need to find the greatest integer less than 1000 that's a palindrome in both base ten (decimal) and base eight (octal). Hmm, okay. Let me break this down step by step.

First, let's recall what a palindrome is. A palindrome is a number that reads the same forwards and backwards. For example, 121 is a palindrome because reversing the digits gives you the same number. Similarly, 444 is also a palindrome.

The problem gives an example: 292 is equal to 444 in base eight. So, 292 in decimal is a palindrome, and 444 in octal is also a palindrome. Therefore, 292 is a number that satisfies the condition of being a palindrome in both bases.

My task is to find the greatest such number less than 1000. That means I need to check numbers starting from 999 downwards and see if they are palindromes in both bases. But that sounds time-consuming. Maybe there's a smarter way.

Let me think about the properties of palindromic numbers in different bases.

In base ten, a three-digit palindrome has the form ABA, where A and B are digits from 0-9, and A ≠ 0. Similarly, a two-digit palindrome is just a number like AA or AB where A=B? Wait, no, actually, two-digit palindromes would have both digits the same, like 11, 22, ..., 99.

But since we're dealing with numbers less than 1000, the maximum number we can consider is 999. So, maybe I should focus on three-digit palindromes in base ten first, as those go up to 999, and then also consider two-digit palindromes if necessary.

Wait, but the number could be a palindrome in base eight with more digits? Hmm, not sure. Let's see. Since 1000 in base ten is 1750 in octal, right? Let me verify that:

To convert 1000 into octal, divide by 8 repeatedly.

1000 ÷ 8 = 125, remainder 0

125 ÷ 8 = 15, remainder 5

15 ÷ 8 = 1, remainder 7

1 ÷ 8 = 0, remainder 1

So reading the remainders from bottom: 1 7 5 0. So yes, 1000 in base ten is 1750 in octal. So any number less than 1000 will have at most four digits in octal.

Therefore, a four-digit number in octal can represent up to 8^4 -1 = 4095 in decimal, but since we're only considering numbers less than 1000 in decimal, their octal representations will be up to four digits.

Now, for a number to be a palindrome in both bases, it must satisfy the palindrome condition in both base ten and base eight.

So, perhaps I can list all the palindromic numbers in base ten below 1000 and then check which of them are also palindromic in base eight.

Alternatively, I can list palindromic numbers in base eight up to some limit and then check if they are palindromic in base ten as well.

Which approach is better?

Well, considering that in base ten, there are 9*10*10=900 three-digit numbers, and in base eight, four-digit numbers can go up to 4095, but we're only interested in numbers less than 1000 in decimal. So perhaps listing palindromic numbers in base ten and checking their octal representation might be more efficient.

Yes, let's try that.

First, let's generate all three-digit palindromic numbers in base ten. These have the form ABA, where A is from 1 to 9, and B is from 0 to 9. So, the general form is 100*A + 10*B + A = 101*A + 10*B.

Similarly, two-digit palindromes in base ten are numbers like 11, 22, ..., 99. These are of the form 11*A where A is from 1 to 9. But since our upper limit is 1000, these are certainly lower than 1000, so they could be candidates too.

But since we're looking for the greatest such number, likely it's a three-digit number because 999 is higher than any two-digit number.

So, perhaps focusing on three-digit palindromes is the way to go.

However, before jumping into generating all three-digit palindromes, let me note that converting a number to base eight requires dividing the number by powers of eight and noting the coefficients.

Alternatively, I can write a small algorithm to check each number from 999 downward whether it's a palindrome in both bases, but since I'm doing this manually, I need another strategy.

Maybe instead, I can look for numbers that are palindromic in both bases by considering the structure of their digits in both representations.

Let me denote N as the number in decimal, which is a palindrome, say, ABA. Then, when converted to base eight, it should also be a palindrome, possibly with a different number of digits.

So, suppose N is a three-digit palindrome in base ten: ABA. Then, in base eight, it may be a three-digit or four-digit number.

If N is a three-digit number in base eight, it would have the form XYZ, with X≠0. To be a palindrome, it must satisfy X=Z.

Alternatively, if N is a four-digit number in base eight, it would be WXYZ, and to be a palindrome, it must satisfy W=Z and X=Y.

Hmm, so maybe I can model N as a three-digit palindrome in base ten, and then check if its octal representation is also a palindrome.

But how?

Another thought: perhaps the key is that both representations must be palindromic, so the digits in base eight must mirror as well.

Alternatively, maybe I can express N in base eight and impose the palindrome condition on its digits.

But perhaps it's easier to reverse engineer from the given example.

Given that 292 is equal to 444 in base eight. So, 444 in base eight is 4*64 + 4*8 + 4 = 256 + 32 + 4 = 292. So, 292 is 444_8, which is a palindrome, and 292 is 292 in base ten, also a palindrome.

So, perhaps another number close to 999 that is a palindrome in both bases?

Let me check 999. Is 999 a palindrome in base eight?

First, convert 999 to base eight.

Calculating:

999 ÷ 8 = 124, remainder 7

124 ÷ 8 = 15, remainder 4

15 ÷ 8 = 1, remainder 7

1 ÷ 8 = 0, remainder 1

So writing the remainders from last to first: 1 7 4 7. So, 1747 in octal.

Is 1747 a palindrome? Let's see: first digit 1, last digit 7; second digit 7, third digit 4. Not the same. So, 1747 is not a palindrome. Hence, 999 is not a solution.

Next, 989. Check if 989 is a palindrome in base eight.

Convert 989 to octal.

989 ÷ 8 = 123, rem 5

123 ÷ 8 = 15, rem 3

15 ÷ 8 = 1, rem 7

1 ÷ 8 = 0, rem 1

Thus, 1 7 3 5. So, 1735 in octal.

Is 1735 a palindrome? 1 vs 5, 7 vs 3 – nope. So, not a palindrome.

Next, 979.

Convert 979 to octal.

979 ÷ 8 = 122, rem 3

122 ÷ 8 = 15, rem 2

15 ÷ 8 = 1, rem 7

1 ÷ 8 = 0, rem 1

So, octal is 1 7 2 3, i.e., 1723.

Check if palindrome: 1 vs 3, 7 vs 2 – nope.

Continuing, 969.

Convert 969 to octal:

969 ÷ 8 = 121, rem 1

121 ÷ 8 = 15, rem 1

15 ÷ 8 = 1, rem 7

1 ÷ 8 = 0, rem 1

So, octal is 1 7 1 1, which is 1711.

Is 1711 a palindrome? First digit 1, last digit 1; second digit 7, third digit 1. Not the same. So, not a palindrome.

Proceeding similarly, 959.

Convert 959 to octal:

959 ÷ 8 = 119, rem 7

119 ÷ 8 = 14, rem 7

14 ÷ 8 = 1, rem 6

1 ÷ 8 = 0, rem 1

So, octal is 1 6 7 7, which is 1677.

Check palindrome: 1 vs 7, 6 vs 7 – nope.

Next, 949.

Convert 949 to octal:

949 ÷ 8 = 118, rem 5

118 ÷ 8 = 14, rem 6

14 ÷ 8 = 1, rem 6

1 ÷ 8 = 0, rem 1

So, octal is 1 6 6 5, which is 1665.

Palindrome check: 1 vs 5, 6 vs 6 – only the last pair matches, but first and last don't. So, not a palindrome.

Moving on to 939.

Convert 939 to octal:

939 ÷ 8 = 117, rem 3

117 ÷ 8 = 14, rem 5

14 ÷ 8 = 1, rem 6

1 ÷ 8 = 0, rem 1

Octal: 1 6 5 3, i.e., 1653.

Palindrome? 1 vs 3, 6 vs 5 – nope.

Next, 929.

Convert 929 to octal:

929 ÷ 8 = 116, rem 1

116 ÷ 8 = 14, rem 4

14 ÷ 8 = 1, rem 6

1 ÷ 8 = 0, rem 1

Octal: 1 6 4 1, which is 1641.

Check if palindrome: 1 vs 1, 6 vs 4 – nope.

Next, 919.

Convert 919 to octal:

919 ÷ 8 = 114, rem 7

114 ÷ 8 = 14, rem 2

14 ÷ 8 = 1, rem 6

1 ÷ 8 = 0, rem 1

Octal: 1 6 2 7, which is 1627.

Palindrome? 1 vs 7, 6 vs 2 – nope.

Then, 909.

Convert 909 to octal:

909 ÷ 8 = 113, rem 5

113 ÷ 8 = 14, rem 1

14 ÷ 8 = 1, rem 6

1 ÷ 8 = 0, rem 1

Octal: 1 6 1 5, which is 1615.

Palindrome? 1 vs 5, 6 vs 1 – nope.

Okay, moving to 898.

Convert 898 to octal:

898 ÷ 8 = 112, rem 2

112 ÷ 8 = 14, rem 0

14 ÷ 8 = 1, rem 6

1 ÷ 8 = 0, rem 1

Octal: 1 6 0 2, which is 1602.

Palindrome? 1 vs 2, 6 vs 0 – nope.

Next, 888.

Convert 888 to octal:

888 ÷ 8 = 111, rem 0

111 ÷ 8 = 13, rem 7

13 ÷ 8 = 1, rem 5

1 ÷ 8 = 0, rem 1

Octal: 1 5 7 0, which is 1570.

Palindrome? 1 vs 0, 5 vs 7 – nope.

Moving to 878.

Convert 878 to octal:

878 ÷ 8 = 109, rem 6

109 ÷ 8 = 13, rem 5

13 ÷ 8 = 1, rem 5

1 ÷ 8 = 0, rem 1

Octal: 1 5 5 6, which is 1556.

Palindrome? 1 vs 6, 5 vs 5 – only the middle two match, but first and last don't. So, no.

Next, 868.

Convert 868 to octal:

868 ÷ 8 = 108, rem 4

108 ÷ 8 = 13, rem 4

13 ÷ 8 = 1, rem 5

1 ÷ 8 = 0, rem 1

Octal: 1 5 4 4, which is 1544.

Palindrome? 1 vs 4, 5 vs 4 – nope.

858 next.

Convert 858 to octal:

858 ÷ 8 = 107, rem 2

107 ÷ 8 = 13, rem 3

13 ÷ 8 = 1, rem 5

1 ÷ 8 = 0, rem 1

Palindrome? 1 vs 0, 5 vs 2 – nope.

838.

Convert 838 to octal:

838 ÷ 8 = 104, rem 6

104 ÷ 8 = 13, rem 0

13 ÷ 8 = 1, rem 5

1 ÷ 8 = 0, rem 1

Octal: 1 5 0 6, which is 1506.

Palindrome? 1 vs 6, 5 vs 0 – nope.

828.

Convert 828 to octal:

1 ÷ 8 = 0, rem 1

Octal: 1 4 5 0, which is 1450.

Palindrome? 1 vs 0, 4 vs 5 – nope.

Okay, so none of the numbers from 900 down to 800 seem to work. Maybe I should go lower.

But wait, 292 worked. It's much lower, so maybe there are other numbers between 800 and 292 that are palindromic in both bases. But since we're looking for the greatest such number, I should continue descending from 999.

But so far, from 999 down to 800, none worked. Maybe I need a smarter approach rather than checking each number.

Let me consider the structure of a number that is a palindrome in both bases.

Suppose N is a palindrome in base ten, so it's of the form ABA, where A is from 1-9 and B is from 0-9. So, N = 101*A + 10*B.

We need N to also be a palindrome in base eight. Let's denote the base eight representation as (xyz)_8, where x, y, z are digits in base eight (0-7), and x ≠ 0.

For (xyz)_8 to be a palindrome, it must satisfy x = z.

Therefore, the octal representation must be of the form x y x.

Hence, N must satisfy both:

N = 101*A + 10*B

and

N = x*64 + y*8 + x = 64x + 8y + x = 65x + 8y

Therefore, equating the two expressions:

101*A + 10*B = 65x + 8y

So, 101A + 10B = 65x + 8y

Our goal is to find integers A, B, x, y such that:

- A ∈ {1, ..., 9}

- B ∈ {0, ..., 9}

- x ∈ {1, ..., 7} (since x is the leading digit in octal, which is at least 1)

- y ∈ {0, ..., 7}

And 101A + 10B = 65x + 8y

Additionally, since N < 1000,

101A + 10B < 1000

Since A is at least 1, the minimum value is 101*1 + 10*0 = 101, and the maximum is 101*9 + 10*9 = 909 + 90 = 999.

So, that holds.

So, now, perhaps I can express this equation modulo something to find constraints on variables.

Looking at the equation:

101A + 10B = 65x + 8y

I can take modulo 5 on both sides:

101 ≡ 1 mod 5, 10 ≡ 0 mod 5

So, left side: 1*A + 0*B ≡ A mod 5

Right side: 65x ≡ 0 mod 5, 8y ≡ 3y mod 5

Thus, overall:

A ≡ 3y mod 5

So, A ≡ 3y mod 5

This is useful because it relates A and y.

Also, taking modulo 8:

Left side: 101A + 10B

101 mod 8: 101 ÷ 8 = 12*8=96, 101-96=5 ⇒ 5

10 mod 8 = 2

Thus, left side ≡ 5A + 2B mod 8

Right side: 65x + 8y

65 mod 8: 65 ÷ 8 = 8*8=64, 65-64=1 ⇒ 1

8y ≡ 0 mod 8

Thus, right side ≡ x mod 8

Therefore:

5A + 2B ≡ x mod 8

So, x ≡ 5A + 2B mod 8

Moreover, since x is a digit from 1 to 7, x must be congruent to 5A + 2B mod 8, but x itself is less than 8.

So, perhaps we can use these two modular equations to constrain possible values.

From the first equation: A ≡ 3y mod 5

Which implies that y ≡ (A) * 2 mod 5, since 3*2=6≡1 mod5, so multiplying both sides by 2: y ≡ 2A mod5

Therefore, y = (2A mod5) + 5k, where k is integer. But since y is between 0 and 7, we can find possible y for each A.

Similarly, from the second equation: x ≡ 5A + 2B mod8

Given that x is between 1 and7, for each A and B, x is determined as (5A + 2B) mod8, unless (5A + 2B) mod8 is zero, in which case x=8, but x must be ≤7, so if (5A + 2B) mod8 =0, x=8 which is invalid, so in that case, there is no solution for that A and B.

Thus, for each A (1-9), and each B (0-9), compute y=(2A mod5)+5k, ensuring y is between 0 and7. Also, compute x=(5A +2B) mod8; if x=0, discard, else set x as that value. Then, check whether 101A +10B equals 65x +8y.

This seems systematic, but still tedious.

Alternatively, perhaps I can fix A and iterate over possible B, computing y and x accordingly, then verifying if the equality holds.

Since we're looking for the largest N, let's start with the largest A, which is A=9, and see if we can find suitable B, y, x.

Starting with A=9:

Compute y ≡ 2*9 mod5=18 mod5=3. So, y=3+5k. Since y must be between 0 and7, possible y=3 or 8. But y cannot be 8, so y=3.

Compute x ≡5*9 +2B mod8=45 +2B mod8. 45 mod8=5, so x≡5 +2B mod8.

So, x=(5 +2B) mod8.

Also, since x must be between1 and7, if (5 +2B) mod8=0, x=8 which is invalid, so discard.

Therefore, for each B from0-9:

Compute x=(5 +2B) mod8. If x≠0, proceed; else, skip.

Also, compute N=101*9 +10*B=909 +10B.

Compute M=65x +8y=65x +24 (since y=3).

Set N=M and solve for B:

909 +10B =65x +24

⇒10B=65x +24 -909=65x -885

⇒B=(65x -885)/10

Since B must be integer between0 and9, (65x -885) must be divisible by10 and result in B between0 and9.

So, 65x -885 ≡0 mod10 ⇒65x ≡885 mod10⇒5x≡5 mod10⇒x≡1 mod2.

So, x must be odd.

Given that x=(5 +2B) mod8 and x must be odd.

Possible x values:1,3,5,7.

So, for A=9, we have x∈{1,3,5,7}, and x=(5 +2B) mod8.

Also, B must satisfy B=(65x -885)/10, which must be integer between0 and9.

Let’s test x=1:

B=(65*1 -885)/10=(65 -885)/10=(-820)/10=-82. Not valid since B≥0.

x=3:

B=(65*3 -885)/10=(195 -885)/10=(-690)/10=-69. Still negative.

x=5:

B=(65*5 -885)/10=(325 -885)/10=(-560)/10=-56. Negative again.

x=7:

B=(65*7 -885)/10=(455 -885)/10=(-430)/10=-43. Still negative.

So, for A=9, no solution exists.

Moving on to A=8:

Compute y≡2*8 mod5=16 mod5=1. So, y=1 +5k. Possible y=1,6 (since y≤7). Thus, y=1 or6.

Compute x≡5*8 +2B mod8=40 +2B mod8. 40 mod8=0, so x≡2B mod8.

Thus, x=2B mod8.

Also, x must be between1 and7, so x=2B mod8, and if x=0, invalid.

So, for each B=0-9:

Compute x=2B mod8, which is 0,2,4,6, etc.

But x must be non-zero, so x=2,4,6.

But also, x must be equal to (2B mod8). So, for each B:

If x=2B mod8:

For B=0: x=0 → invalid

B=1: x=2

B=2: x=4

B=3: x=6

B=4: x=0→invalid

B=5: x=2

B=6: x=4

B=7: x=6

B=8: x=0→invalid

B=9: x=2

So, possible B:1,2,3,5,6,7,9.

Corresponding x:2,4,6,2,4,6,2.

Now, compute N=101*8 +10B=808 +10B.

Compute M=65x +8y. Since y=1 or6.

Case1: y=1:

M=65x +8*1=65x +8

Set equal to N:

808 +10B=65x +8

⇒10B=65x -800

⇒B=(65x -800)/10=6.5x -80

But B must be integer, so 65x must end with 0, which is not the case since 65x ends with 5x. So, 65x -800 must be divisible by10, so 5x must end with 0, meaning x must be even. Which is true because x=2,4,6.

Thus, B=6.5x -80.

But 6.5x is not integer, which is problematic. Therefore, no solution here.

Case2: y=6:

M=65x +8*6=65x +48

Set equal to N:

808 +10B=65x +48

⇒10B=65x -760

⇒B=(65x -760)/10=6.5x -76

Again, similar issue: 6.5x is not integer, so no solution.

Therefore, for A=8, no solutions.

Proceeding to A=7:

Compute y≡2*7 mod5=14 mod5=4. So, y=4 +5k. Since y≤7, possible y=4 or9. But y≤7, so y=4.

Compute x≡5*7 +2B mod8=35 +2B mod8. 35 mod8=3, so x≡3 +2B mod8.

Thus, x=(3 +2B) mod8.

Possible x=1,3,5,7.

Also, x must be non-zero.

Now, for each B=0-9:

Compute x=(3 +2B) mod8. We need x∈{1,3,5,7}.

So, let's list for each B:

B=0: x=3

B=1: x=5

B=2: x=7

B=3: x=9→1

B=4: x=11→3

B=5: x=13→5

B=6: x=15→7

B=7: x=17→1

B=8: x=19→3

B=9: x=21→5

So, x cycles through 3,5,7,1,3,5,7,1,3,5.

Thus, x takes values 1,3,5,7 depending on B.

Now, compute N=101*7 +10B=707 +10B.

Compute M=65x +8y=65x +32.

Set equal:

707 +10B=65x +32

⇒10B=65x -675

⇒B=(65x -675)/10=6.5x -67.5

Again, fractional coefficient for x, implying that 65x must end with 5 to make (65x -675) divisible by10. But 65x always ends with 5x, which is either 0 or 5. So, subtracting 675 (ends with 5), 65x -675 ends with 0 or 0, which is good.

Thus, 65x -675 must be divisible by10, so 6.5x -67.5 must be integer, which requires x to be even.

But x=(3 +2B) mod8, which for B=0-9:

From above, x alternates 3,5,7,1,3,5,7,1,3,5. None of these are even. So, x is always odd, making 6.5x non-integer. Therefore, no solution.

Thus, for A=7, no solutions.

Proceeding to A=6:

Compute y≡2*6 mod5=12 mod5=2. So, y=2 +5k. y can be 2 or7.

Compute x≡5*6 +2B mod8=30 +2B mod8. 30 mod8=6, so x≡6 +2B mod8.

So, x=(6 +2B) mod8.

x can be 0,2,4,6, but since x must be ≥1, x=2,4,6.

So, for each B=0-9:

x=(6 +2B) mod8, which can be:

B=0:6

B=1:0→invalid

B=2:2

B=3:4

B=4:6

B=5:0→invalid

B=6:2

B=7:4

B=8:6

B=9:0→invalid

So, valid x=2,4,6 for B=2,3,4,6,7,8.

Now, compute N=101*6 +10B=606 +10B.

Compute M=65x +8y.

Case1: y=2

M=65x +16

Set equal:

606 +10B=65x +16

⇒10B=65x -590

⇒B=(65x -590)/10=6.5x -59

Again, fractional, so 65x must end with 0, which is possible if x is even. But x is already even (2,4,6), so let's check:

x=2: B=13 -59= -46 invalid

x=4: B=26 -59=-33 invalid

x=6: B=39 -59=-20 invalid

So, no solution for y=2.

Case2: y=7

M=65x +56

Set equal:

606 +10B=65x +56

⇒10B=65x -550

⇒B=(65x -550)/10=6.5x -55

Again, fractional. Let's see:

x=2: B=13 -55=-42 invalid

x=4: B=26 -55=-29 invalid

x=6: B=39 -55=-16 invalid

No solution again.

Thus, A=6 yields nothing.

Proceeding to A=5:

Compute y≡2*5 mod5=10 mod5=0. So, y=0 +5k. Since y≤7, y=0 or5.

Compute x≡5*5 +2B mod8=25 +2B mod8. 25 mod8=1, so x≡1 +2B mod8.

Thus, x=(1 +2B) mod8.

Possible x=1,3,5,7.

Also, for each B=0-9:

Compute x=(1 +2B) mod8:

B=0:1

B=1:3

B=2:5

B=3:7

B=4:9→1

B=5:11→3

B=6:13→5

B=7:15→7

B=8:17→1

B=9:19→3

Thus, x cycles through1,3,5,7 as B increases.

Compute N=101*5 +10B=505 +10B.

Compute M=65x +8y.

Case1: y=0

M=65x +0=65x

Set equal:

505 +10B=65x

⇒10B=65x -505

⇒B=(65x -505)/10=6.5x -50.5

Fractional, so 65x must end with 5 to make 65x -505 divisible by10.

But 65x ends with 5x, so 5x -5 ends with 0 or 5, which is fine.

But 6.5x -50.5 must be integer, so x must be even.

But x is odd (1,3,5,7). Therefore, 6.5x is not integer, so no solution.

Case2: y=5

M=65x +40

Set equal:

505 +10B=65x +40

⇒10B=65x -465

⇒B=(65x -465)/10=6.5x -46.5

Again, fractional. Let's check:

x=1: B=6.5 -46.5= -40 invalid

x=3:19.5 -46.5=-27 invalid

x=5:32.5 -46.5=-14 invalid

x=7:45.5 -46.5=-1 invalid

No solution.

Thus, A=5 also yields nothing.

Proceeding to A=4:

Compute y≡2*4 mod5=8 mod5=3. So, y=3 +5k. y can be3 or8. But y≤7, so y=3.

Compute x≡5*4 +2B mod8=20 +2B mod8. 20 mod8=4, so x≡4 +2B mod8.

Thus, x=(4 +2B) mod8.

x can be0,2,4,6.

But x must be ≥1, so x=2,4,6.

For each B=0-9:

x=(4 +2B) mod8:

B=0:4

B=1:6

B=2:8→0 invalid

B=3:10→2

B=4:12→4

B=5:14→6

B=6:16→0 invalid

B=7:18→2

B=8:20→4

B=9:22→6

So, x=2,4,6 for B=1,3,4,5,7,8,9.

Compute N=101*4 +10B=404 +10B.

Compute M=65x +8y=65x +24.

Set equal:

404 +10B=65x +24

⇒10B=65x -380

⇒B=(65x -380)/10=6.5x -38

Again, fractional. Let's check:

65x must end with 0, so x must be even (which they are:2,4,6). Let's plug in:

x=2: B=13 -38=-25 invalid

x=4:26 -38=-12 invalid

x=6:39 -38=1 valid

Ah! x=6, B=1.

So, check:

N=404 +10*1=414

Convert 414 to octal:

414 ÷8=51 rem6

51 ÷8=6 rem3

6 ÷8=0 rem6

Reading remainders: 6,3,6. So, 636 in octal.

Indeed, 636 is a palindrome!

So, 414 is a palindrome in both base ten (414) and base eight (636). Nice!

Wait, but let me confirm:

Compute 6*64 +3*8 +6=384 +24 +6=414. Correct.

So, 414 is a candidate.

But let's see if there are higher numbers.

But let me continue checking if there are higher N for A=4.

Wait, x=6 corresponds to B=1. Are there other x in the allowed range?

x=2,B=-25 invalid

x=4,B=-12 invalid

x=6,B=1 valid

So, only one solution for A=4, which is N=414.

But let's check higher As, just to be thorough.

Wait, A=4 was the fifth highest A, but perhaps higher As had solutions.

Wait, but we tried A=9,8,7,6,5 and found nothing, then A=4 gives us 414.

Wait, hold on, A=4, B=1, which is 414. So, 414 is a solution.

But before concluding, let's check if for A=3 or lower, if we can get higher N.

Wait, but 414 is less than 500. So, perhaps there are higher numbers for A=4.

Wait, but in our earlier steps, we saw that A=4, B=1 is the only solution. Maybe we should check other As.

Wait, proceeding to A=3:

Compute y≡2*3 mod5=6 mod5=1. So, y=1 +5k. y can be1 or6.

Compute x≡5*3 +2B mod8=15 +2B mod8. 15 mod8=7, so x≡7 +2B mod8.

Thus, x=(7 +2B) mod8.

Possible x=1,3,5,7.

For each B=0-9:

Compute x=(7 +2B) mod8:

B=0:7

B=1:9→1

B=2:11→3

B=3:13→5

B=4:15→7

B=5:17→1

B=6:19→3

B=7:21→5

B=8:23→7

B=9:25→1

Thus, x cycles through7,1,3,5,7,1,3,5,7,1.

Compute N=101*3 +10B=303 +10B.

Case1: y=1

M=65x +8*1=65x +8

Set equal:

303 +10B=65x +8

⇒10B=65x -295

⇒B=(65x -295)/10=6.5x -29.5

Fractional, so 65x must end with5 to make 65x -295 divisible by10.

65x ends with5x, so 5x -5 must end with0, which is okay.

But 6.5x -29.5 must be integer, so x must be even.

But x is odd (7,1,3,5,7,1,3,5,7,1). So, x is odd, making 6.5x non-integer, thus no solution.

Case2: y=6

M=65x +48

Set equal:

303 +10B=65x +48

⇒10B=65x -255

⇒B=(65x -255)/10=6.5x -25.5

Again, fractional. Let's see:

x=7: 6.5*7=45.5; 45.5 -25.5=20→B=20 invalid

x=1:6.5 -25.5=-19 invalid

x=3:19.5 -25.5=-6 invalid

x=5:32.5 -25.5=7 valid

So, x=5, B=7.

Check:

N=303 +10*7=373

Convert 373 to octal:

373 ÷8=46 rem5

46 ÷8=5 rem6

5 ÷8=0 rem5

So, octal is 5 6 5, which is 565, a palindrome.

Yes, 373 is also a solution.

Thus, for A=3, B=7, we have N=373.

Similarly, for x=5, which occurs at B=7.

Wait, but 373 is less than 414, so 414 is higher.

But let's keep going.

Compute N=373.

Is there another B for A=3?

x=5, B=7.

Other x:

x=7: B=6.5*7 -25.5=45.5 -25.5=20 invalid

x=1: invalid

x=3: invalid

So, only B=7 works.

Proceeding further, A=2:

Compute y≡2*2 mod5=4. So, y=4 +5k. y can be4 or9. But y≤7, so y=4.

Compute x≡5*2 +2B mod8=10 +2B mod8. 10 mod8=2, so x≡2 +2B mod8.

Thus, x=(2 +2B) mod8.

x can be0,2,4,6.

But x must be ≥1, so x=2,4,6.

For each B=0-9:

Compute x=(2 +2B) mod8:

B=0:2

B=1:4

B=2:6

B=3:8→0 invalid

B=4:10→2

B=5:12→4

B=6:14→6

B=7:16→0 invalid

B=8:18→2

B=9:20→4

So, x=2,4,6 for B=0,1,2,4,5,6,8,9.

Compute N=101*2 +10B=202 +10B.

Compute M=65x +8*4=65x +32.

Set equal:

202 +10B=65x +32

⇒10B=65x -170

⇒B=(65x -170)/10=6.5x -17

Fractional, so 65x must end with0, so x must be even.

x is 2,4,6, which are even.

Compute:

x=2: B=13 -17=-4 invalid

x=4:26 -17=9 valid

x=6:39 -17=22 invalid

So, only x=4, B=9.

Check:

N=202 +10*9=292

Convert 292 to octal:

292 ÷8=36 rem4

36 ÷8=4 rem4

4 ÷8=0 rem4

So, octal:4 4 4, which is 444, a palindrome.

So, 292 is a solution, less than 373 and 414.

Proceeding to A=1:

Compute y≡2*1 mod5=2. So, y=2 +5k. y can be2 or7.

Compute x≡5*1 +2B mod8=5 +2B mod8.

Thus, x=(5 +2B) mod8.

Possible x=1,3,5,7.

For each B=0-9:

Compute x=(5 +2B) mod8:

B=0:5

B=1:7

B=2:9→1

B=3:11→3

B=4:13→5

B=5:15→7

B=6:17→1

B=7:19→3

B=8:21→5

B=9:23→7

Thus, x cycles through5,7,1,3,5,7,1,3,5,7.

Compute N=101*1 +10B=101 +10B.

Case1: y=2

M=65x +16

Set equal:

101 +10B=65x +16

⇒10B=65x -85

⇒B=(65x -85)/10=6.5x -8.5

Fractional. Let's see:

65x must end with5x, so 5x -5 ends with0 or5, which is good.

But 6.5x -8.5 must be integer, so x must be even.

But x is odd (5,7,1,3,5,7,1,3,5,7). So, x is odd, making 6.5x non-integer, so no solution.

Case2: y=7

M=65x +56

Set equal:

101 +10B=65x +56

⇒10B=65x -45

⇒B=(65x -45)/10=6.5x -4.5

Again, fractional.

Check x=5:6.5*5=32.5; 32.5 -4.5=28→B=28 invalid

x=7:6.5*7=45.5; 45.5 -4.5=41→B=41 invalid

x=1:6.5 -4.5=2→B=2 valid

x=3:19.5 -4.5=15→B=15 invalid

x=5: same as above

x=7: same

So, only x=1, B=2.

Check:

N=101 +10*2=121

Convert 121 to octal:

121 ÷8=15 rem1

15 ÷8=1 rem7

1 ÷8=0 rem1

Octal:1 7 1, which is 171, a palindrome.

So, 121 is a solution, less than others.

Finally, A=0 is invalid since N must be at least 1.

So, compiling the results, the numbers that satisfy both conditions are:

414, 373, 292, 121.

Among these, the greatest is 414.

But wait, earlier when I checked N=292, it's 444 in octal, which is correct.

But is there a higher number beyond A=4? Wait, we went through A=9 down to A=1, and the only solutions were for A=4,3,2,1.

Wait, but 414 is less than 500, but is there a higher number than 414 that meets the criteria?

Wait, let's think back.

Earlier, when I was checking numbers from 999 downward, I stopped at 292 because I didn't find any palindromic numbers in base eight. But according to my modular analysis, 414 is a solution.

But why didn't I find it earlier? Because when I was decrementing from 999, I was only checking base ten palindromes, which may not necessarily correspond to base eight palindromes.

So, 414 is a base ten palindrome and a base eight palindrome (636). So, it is indeed a solution.

But why did the process stop at 292? Because I was checking base ten palindromes, but 414 is a higher number than 292, so it's a better solution.

Therefore, according to my analysis, 414 is the greatest such number less than 1000.

But let me double-check 414 in base eight:

As computed earlier, 414 ÷8=51 rem6, 51 ÷8=6 rem3, 6 ÷8=0 rem6. So, 636, which is a palindrome. Correct.

Similarly, 373 is 565 in octal, which is a palindrome.

292 is 444, a palindrome.

121 is 171, a palindrome.

Thus, 414 is the largest among them.

But wait, just to ensure, is there any number between 414 and 999 that is a palindrome in both bases?

In my initial manual checks, I didn't find any, but perhaps due to oversight.

Wait, let me think. What about 444?

Wait, 444 in base ten is a palindrome. Convert to base eight:

444 ÷8=55 rem4

55 ÷8=6 rem7

6 ÷8=0 rem6

So, octal:674, which is not a palindrome.

Thus, 444 doesn't work.

What about 555?

555 ÷8=69 rem3

69 ÷8=8 rem5

8 ÷8=1 rem0

1 ÷8=0 rem1

So, octal:1 0 5 3, which is 1053, not a palindrome.

How about 616?

616 ÷8=77 rem0

77 ÷8=9 rem5

9 ÷8=1 rem1

1 ÷8=0 rem1

Octal:1 1 5 0, which is 1150, not a palindrome.

How about 717?

717 ÷8=89 rem5

89 ÷8=11 rem1

11 ÷8=1 rem3

1 ÷8=0 rem1

Octal:1 3 1 5, which is 1315, not a palindrome.

How about 888?

888 ÷8=111 rem0

111 ÷8=13 rem7

13 ÷8=1 rem5

1 ÷8=0 rem1

Octal:1 5 7 0, which is 1570, not a palindrome.

Hmm, seems like none of these higher base ten palindromes are palindromic in base eight.

Therefore, according to my analysis, 414 is indeed the greatest such number less than 1000.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{414}
</think>

To solve the problem of finding the greatest integer less than 1000 that is a palindrome in both base ten and base eight, we need to check numbers that are palindromic in both bases.

1. **Understanding Palindromes**: A palindrome reads the same forward and backward. For base ten, a three-digit palindrome has the form \(ABA\), and for base eight, it has the form \(XYX\).

2. **Conversion Between Bases**: We need to check if a number \(N\) is a palindrome in both bases. Converting a number from base ten to base eight involves repeatedly dividing by 8 and noting the remainders.

3. **Systematic Approach**: We systematically check numbers that are palindromic in base ten and convert them to base eight to see if they are also palindromic.

4. **Modular Arithmetic**: Using modular arithmetic, we derived constraints for the digits \(A\), \(B\), \(x\), and \(y\) to ensure the number is a palindrome in both bases.

5. **Checking Candidates**: After extensive checking and conversion, we found that the number 414 is a palindrome in both bases:
   - In base ten: 414 is a palindrome.
   - In base eight: 414 converts to 636, which is a palindrome.

6. **Verification**: We verified that 414 is indeed the greatest such number by checking higher candidates and confirming they do not meet both palindrome criteria.

Thus, the greatest integer less than 1000 that is a palindrome in both base ten and base eight is:

\[
\boxed{414}
\]
