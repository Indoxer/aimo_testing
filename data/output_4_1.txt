 The problem: 
Let $S$ be the set of all rational numbers that can be expressed as a repeating decimal in the form $0.\overline{abcd},$ where at least one of the digits $a,$ $b,$ $c,$ or $d$ is nonzero. Let $N$ be the number of distinct numerators obtained when numbers in $S$ are written as fractions in lowest terms. For example, both $4$ and $410$ are counted among the distinct numerators for numbers in $S$ because $0.\overline{3636} = \frac{4}{11}$ and $0.\overline{1230} = \frac{410}{3333}.$ Find the remainder when $N$ is divided by $1000.$


To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of distinct numerators when rational numbers in the set \( S \) are expressed as fractions in lowest terms. The set \( S \) consists of all rational numbers that can be expressed as a repeating decimal in the form \( 0.\overline{abcd} \), where at least one of the digits \( a, b, c, d \) is nonzero.

First, let's express \( 0.\overline{abcd} \) as a fraction. A repeating decimal \( 0.\overline{abcd} \) can be written as:
\[
0.\overline{abcd} = \frac{abcd}{9999}
\]
where \( abcd \) represents the four-digit number formed by the digits \( a, b, c, d \).

Next, we need to consider the fractions in their lowest terms. To do this, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \( abcd \) and \( 9999 \). The number \( 9999 \) can be factored into prime factors:
\[
9999 = 3^2 \times 11 \times 101
\]

For a fraction \( \frac{abcd}{9999} \) to be in its lowest terms, \( abcd \) must not share any prime factors with \( 9999 \). Therefore, \( abcd \) must not be divisible by \( 3 \), \( 11 \), or \( 101 \).

We will use Euler's Totient Function \( \phi(n) \) to count the number of integers up to \( n \) that are coprime to \( n \). For \( n = 9999 \):
\[
\phi(9999) = 9999 \left(1 - \frac{1}{3}\right) \left(1 - \frac{1}{11}\right) \left(1 - \frac{1}{101}\right)
\]
Calculating each term:
\[
1 - \frac{1}{3} = \frac{2}{3}, \quad 1 - \frac{1}{11} = \frac{10}{11}, \quad 1 - \frac{1}{101} = \frac{100}{101}
\]
Thus,
\[
\phi(9999) = 9999 \times \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{10}{11} \times \frac{100}{101}
\]
Simplifying step-by-step:
\[
9999 \times \frac{2}{3} = 6666
\]
\[
6666 \times \frac{10}{11} = 6060
\]
\[
6060 \times \frac{100}{101} = 6000
\]

Therefore, there are \( 6000 \) integers between \( 1 \) and \( 9999 \) that are coprime to \( 9999 \). These integers are the numerators of the fractions in their lowest terms.

Finally, we need to find the remainder when \( N = 6000 \) is divided by \( 1000 \):
\[
6000 \mod 1000 = 0
\]

Thus, the remainder when \( N \) is divided by \( 1000 \) is:
\[
\boxed{0}
\]
