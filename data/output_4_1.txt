 The problem: 
Let $S$ be the set of all rational numbers that can be expressed as a repeating decimal in the form $0.\overline{abcd},$ where at least one of the digits $a,$ $b,$ $c,$ or $d$ is nonzero. Let $N$ be the number of distinct numerators obtained when numbers in $S$ are written as fractions in lowest terms. For example, both $4$ and $410$ are counted among the distinct numerators for numbers in $S$ because $0.\overline{3636} = \frac{4}{11}$ and $0.\overline{1230} = \frac{410}{3333}.$ Find the remainder when $N$ is divided by $1000.$


To solve the problem, we first need to understand the structure of the repeating decimals of the form \(0.\overline{abcd}\). A repeating decimal \(0.\overline{abcd}\) can be expressed as a fraction:

\[
0.\overline{abcd} = \frac{abcd}{9999}
\]

where \(abcd\) is the four-digit number formed by the digits \(a, b, c, d\). Since \(abcd\) ranges from 0000 to 9999, the fraction \(\frac{abcd}{9999}\) can be simplified by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \(abcd\) and 9999. The number 9999 factors as:

\[
9999 = 3^2 \times 11 \times 101
\]

For the fraction \(\frac{abcd}{9999}\) to be in its lowest terms, \(abcd\) must not share any prime factors with 9999 other than 1. Therefore, \(abcd\) must not be divisible by 3, 11, or 101.

We will use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to count the number of integers from 0000 to 9999 that are not divisible by 3, 11, or 101. First, we calculate the number of integers from 0000 to 9999 that are divisible by each of these numbers:

- The number of multiples of 3 is \(\left\lfloor \frac{9999}{3} \right\rfloor = 3333\).
- The number of multiples of 11 is \(\left\lfloor \frac{9999}{11} \right\rfloor = 909\).
- The number of multiples of 101 is \(\left\lfloor \frac{9999}{101} \right\rfloor = 99\).

Next, we calculate the number of integers from 0000 to 9999 that are divisible by the least common multiples (LCM) of pairs of these numbers:

- The number of multiples of \(3 \times 11 = 33\) is \(\left\lfloor \frac{9999}{33} \right\rfloor = 303\).
- The number of multiples of \(3 \times 101 = 303\) is \(\left\lfloor \frac{9999}{303} \right\rfloor = 33\).
- The number of multiples of \(11 \times 101 = 1111\) is \(\left\lfloor \frac{9999}{1111} \right\rfloor = 9\).

Finally, we calculate the number of integers from 0000 to 9999 that are divisible by the LCM of all three numbers:

- The number of multiples of \(3 \times 11 \times 101 = 3333\) is \(\left\lfloor \frac{9999}{3333} \right\rfloor = 3\).

Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, the number of integers from 0000 to 9999 that are divisible by 3, 11, or 101 is:

\[
3333 + 909 + 99 - 303 - 33 - 9 + 3 = 3996
\]

Therefore, the number of integers from 0000 to 9999 that are not divisible by 3, 11, or 101 is:

\[
10000 - 3996 = 6004
\]

Thus, the number of distinct numerators obtained when numbers in \(S\) are written as fractions in lowest terms is 6004. The remainder when 6004 is divided by 1000 is:

\[
\boxed{004}
\]
