 The problem: 
Let $x,y,$ and $z$ be real numbers satisfying the system of equations
\begin{align*} xy + 4z &= 60 \\ yz + 4x &= 60 \\ zx + 4y &= 60. \end{align*}
Let $S$ be the set of possible values of $x.$ Find the sum of the squares of the elements of $S.$


Okay, so I have this system of equations with three variables x, y, and z. They all seem to be similar, each involving a product of two variables plus four times the third equals 60. Hmm, interesting. Let me write them down again:

1. \( xy + 4z = 60 \)
2. \( yz + 4x = 60 \)
3. \( zx + 4y = 60 \)

I need to find the set S of possible values of x and then compute the sum of the squares of these elements. So, first, let's see if we can solve for x, y, z.

Since all three equations are similar, maybe there's some symmetry here. Perhaps x, y, z are equal? Let me test that assumption.

Assume \( x = y = z \). Then plugging into the first equation: \( x^2 + 4x = 60 \).

So, \( x^2 + 4x - 60 = 0 \). Let's solve this quadratic equation.

Using quadratic formula: \( x = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 240}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{256}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm 16}{2} \).

So, \( x = \frac{12}{2} = 6 \) or \( x = \frac{-20}{2} = -10 \).

Therefore, if x=y=z=6 or x=y=z=-10, they satisfy the equations. So, at least x can be 6 or -10.

But wait, is that all the solutions? Maybe not. Because perhaps x, y, z aren't all equal. Maybe two are equal and one is different. Or maybe all are different.

Let me consider another approach. Let me try to express each variable in terms of another and substitute.

From the first equation: \( xy + 4z = 60 \). Let me solve for z: \( z = \frac{60 - xy}{4} \).

Similarly, from the second equation: \( yz + 4x = 60 \). Let me solve for z as well: \( z = \frac{60 - 4x}{y} \).

Wait, but I just solved for z in terms of x and y from the first equation. So, set those equal:

\( \frac{60 - xy}{4} = \frac{60 - 4x}{y} \).

Multiply both sides by 4y to eliminate denominators:

\( (60 - xy)y = 4(60 - 4x) \).

Expand both sides:

Left side: \( 60y - xy^2 \).

Right side: \( 240 - 16x \).

So, bringing everything to one side:

\( 60y - xy^2 - 240 + 16x = 0 \).

Hmm, seems messy. Maybe factor differently.

Alternatively, let's consider subtracting equations to eliminate variables.

Let me subtract the first equation from the second:

Equation 2 - Equation 1:

\( (yz + 4x) - (xy + 4z) = 60 - 60 \).

Which simplifies to:

\( yz + 4x - xy - 4z = 0 \).

Factor terms:

\( y(z - x) + 4(x - z) = 0 \).

Notice that \( (z - x) = -(x - z) \), so rewrite:

\( y(z - x) - 4(z - x) = 0 \).

Factor out \( (z - x) \):

\( (z - x)(y - 4) = 0 \).

So, either \( z = x \) or \( y = 4 \).

Similarly, subtract equation 3 from equation 2:

Equation 3: \( zx + 4y = 60 \)

Equation 2: \( yz + 4x = 60 \)

Subtract: \( zx + 4y - yz - 4x = 0 \).

Factor:

\( z(x - y) + 4(y - x) = 0 \).

Again, \( (x - y) = -(y - x) \), so:

\( z(x - y) - 4(x - y) = 0 \).

Factor out \( (x - y) \):

\( (x - y)(z - 4) = 0 \).

Thus, either \( x = y \) or \( z = 4 \).

Similarly, subtract equation 1 from equation 3:

Equation 1: \( xy + 4z = 60 \)

Equation 3: \( zx + 4y = 60 \)

Subtract: \( xy + 4z - zx - 4y = 0 \).

Factor:

\( x(y - z) + 4(z - y) = 0 \).

Again, \( (y - z) = -(z - y) \), so:

\( x(y - z) - 4(y - z) = 0 \).

Factor out \( (y - z) \):

\( (y - z)(x - 4) = 0 \).

Hence, either \( y = z \) or \( x = 4 \).

Putting it all together:

From equation 2 - 1: \( z = x \) or \( y = 4 \).

From equation 3 - 2: \( x = y \) or \( z = 4 \).

From equation 1 - 3: \( y = z \) or \( x = 4 \).

So, now we have several cases to consider.

Case 1: All variables are equal, i.e., \( x = y = z \). We already considered this earlier and found x=6 and x=-10.

Case 2: Not all variables are equal. So, some variables might be equal and others different. Let's explore the possibilities.

First, suppose \( z = x \) from equation 2 - 1.

Then, from equation 3 - 2, either \( x = y \) or \( z = 4 \). But since \( z = x \), if we take \( x = y \), then all variables are equal, which is case 1. Alternatively, if \( z = 4 \), but \( z = x \), so x=4.

If x=4, then from equation 1: \( xy + 4z = 60 \). Since x=4 and z=x=4, plug in:

\( 4y + 4*4 = 60 \implies 4y + 16 = 60 \implies 4y = 44 \implies y = 11 \).

Now check equation 2: \( yz + 4x = 60 \). Plug in y=11, z=4, x=4:

\( 11*4 + 4*4 = 44 + 16 = 60 \). It works.

Check equation 3: \( zx + 4y = 4*4 + 4*11 = 16 + 44 = 60 \). Also works.

So, another solution is x=4, y=11, z=4.

Wait, so when x=4, y=11, z=4. So x=4 is another possible value for x.

So, our set S now includes 6, -10, and 4.

Is that all? Let's see.

Case 3: Suppose instead that from equation 2-1, \( y = 4 \).

So, y=4. Then from equation 3 - 2, either \( x = y \) or \( z = 4 \). If x=y=4, then from equation 1: \( xy + 4z = 4*4 + 4z = 16 + 4z = 60 \implies 4z = 44 \implies z=11 \).

So, another solution is x=4, y=4, z=11.

But in this case, x=4, which we already had in the previous case. So, no new x value.

Alternatively, from equation 3 - 2, if z=4, then from equation 1: \( xy + 4*4 = xy + 16 = 60 \implies xy = 44 \).

From equation 2: \( y*4 + 4x = 4y + 4x = 60 \implies y + x = 15 \).

So, we have:

\( xy = 44 \)

\( x + y = 15 \)

This is a system of equations in x and y. Let's solve.

We can express y = 15 - x, plug into xy=44:

\( x(15 - x) = 44 \implies 15x - x^2 = 44 \implies x^2 -15x +44 = 0 \).

Quadratic equation: \( x = [15 ± sqrt(225 - 176)] / 2 = [15 ± sqrt(49)] / 2 = [15 ±7]/2.

Thus, x=(15+7)/2=22/2=11 or x=(15-7)/2=8/2=4.

So, x=11 or x=4.

If x=11, then y=15 -11=4. Then z=4 from before.

If x=4, then y=11, z=4 as before.

So, in this scenario, we get x=11 and x=4. x=11 is a new value.

So, adding x=11 to our set S.

So, now S is {6, -10, 4, 11}.

Is there any other case?

Case 4: Maybe another combination where \( x ≠ y ≠ z \) without being covered above.

Wait, let me think. From the earlier deductions, we had multiple conditions. Let me consider different possibilities.

Suppose, for instance, that none of the variables are equal, but all the other options (from the subtractions) lead to contradictions. Wait, but in the previous cases, we've covered when two variables are equal or when certain variables are fixed.

Wait, let's recap.

From equation 2 -1: Either z=x or y=4.

From equation 3 -2: Either x=y or z=4.

From equation 1 -3: Either y=z or x=4.

So, if we assume that none of the variables are equal, meaning z≠x, x≠y, y≠z, then we must have all the other options.

That is, y=4, z=4, and x=4.

But if y=4, z=4, and x=4, then all variables are equal, which contradicts the assumption that none are equal.

Hence, there must be at least two variables equal.

Therefore, all solutions must have at least two variables equal, leading to either all equal, x=4, or another pair equal.

Therefore, the solutions are:

1. All variables equal: x=y=z=6 or x=y=z=-10.

2. Two variables equal to 4, and the third variable equal to 11 or 4.

Wait, actually, in the case where y=4, we found x=11 or x=4.

But in the case where z=4, we also found x=11 or x=4.

So, in total, the distinct solutions for x are 6, -10, 4, and 11.

Wait, but hold on: when x=4, y=11, z=4; when x=11, y=4, z=4; and when x=6, y=6, z=6; and x=-10, y=-10, z=-10.

Are there any other solutions?

Wait, let's double-check.

When we had Case 2: z=x, then from equation 3 -2, either x=y or z=4. If x=y, then all variables are equal, which gives x=6 or x=-10. If z=4, then x=4, and we found y=11.

Similarly, when considering y=4, from equation 1 -3, either y=z or x=4. If y=z, then all variables equal, giving x=6 or x=-10. If x=4, then from equation 1, we found y=11 or something else? Wait, no, when x=4, y can be 11 or 4 depending on the case.

Wait, actually, when x=4, you can have two scenarios: one where y=11, z=4, and another where y=4, z=11.

But in both cases, x=4 remains.

Similarly, when x=11, y=4, z=4.

So, indeed, the possible x-values are 6, -10, 4, 11.

Therefore, the set S is { -10, 4, 6, 11 }.

Wait, but hold on a second. When x=11, does that correspond to a unique solution?

Yes, because when x=11, y=4, z=4, which satisfies all three equations.

Similarly, when x=4, we have two possibilities: y=11, z=4 or y=4, z=11, but in both cases, x=4.

So, x=4 appears twice but is still only one unique value.

So, the set S is {-10, 4, 6, 11}. Therefore, the elements are -10, 4, 6, 11.

Now, we need to compute the sum of the squares of these elements.

Compute (-10)^2 + 4^2 + 6^2 + 11^2.

Calculating each term:

(-10)^2 = 100

4^2 = 16

6^2 = 36

11^2 = 121

Sum: 100 + 16 = 116; 116 + 36 = 152; 152 + 121 = 273.

Therefore, the sum of the squares is 273.

Hence, the answer is 273.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{273}
</think>

Given the system of equations:
\[
\begin{align*}
xy + 4z &= 60 \\
yz + 4x &= 60 \\
zx + 4y &= 60,
\end{align*}
we need to find the set \( S \) of possible values of \( x \) and then compute the sum of the squares of these elements.

First, we consider the possibility that \( x = y = z \). Substituting \( x = y = z \) into the first equation, we get:
\[
x^2 + 4x = 60 \implies x^2 + 4x - 60 = 0.
\]
Solving this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula, we find:
\[
x = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{256}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm 16}{2}.
\]
This gives the solutions \( x = 6 \) or \( x = -10 \).

Next, we consider the cases where not all variables are equal. By subtracting pairs of equations, we derive conditions such as \( z = x \), \( x = y \), or specific values for \( y \) and \( z \). Through detailed analysis, we find additional solutions where \( x = 4 \) or \( x = 11 \).

Thus, the set \( S \) of possible values of \( x \) is \(\{-10, 4, 6, 11\}\).

To find the sum of the squares of these elements, we compute:
\[
(-10)^2 + 4^2 + 6^2 + 11^2 = 100 + 16 + 36 + 121 = 273.
\]

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{273}
\]
