 The problem: 
Quadratic polynomials $P(x)$ and $Q(x)$ have leading coefficients $2$ and $-2,$ respectively. The graphs of both polynomials pass through the two points $(16,54)$ and $(20,53).$ Find $P(0) + Q(0).$


To solve for \(P(0) + Q(0)\), we start by expressing the quadratic polynomials \(P(x)\) and \(Q(x)\) in their general forms:
\[ P(x) = 2x^2 + ax + b \]
\[ Q(x) = -2x^2 + cx + d \]

We know that both polynomials pass through the points \((16, 54)\) and \((20, 53)\). This gives us four equations:

For \(P(x)\):
\[ 2(16)^2 + 16a + b = 54 \implies 512 + 16a + b = 54 \implies 16a + b = -458 \tag{1} \]
\[ 2(20)^2 + 20a + b = 53 \implies 800 + 20a + b = 53 \implies 20a + b = -747 \tag{2} \]

For \(Q(x)\):
\[ -2(16)^2 + 16c + d = 54 \implies -512 + 16c + d = 54 \implies 16c + d = 566 \tag{3} \]
\[ -2(20)^2 + 20c + d = 53 \implies -800 + 20c + d = 53 \implies 20c + d = 853 \tag{4} \]

We solve equations (1) and (2) for \(a\) and \(b\):
Subtract equation (1) from equation (2):
\[ (20a + b) - (16a + b) = -747 - (-458) \implies 4a = -289 \implies a = -\frac{289}{4} \]
Substitute \(a = -\frac{289}{4}\) into equation (1):
\[ 16\left(-\frac{289}{4}\right) + b = -458 \implies -1156 + b = -458 \implies b = 698 \]

So, \(P(x) = 2x^2 - \frac{289}{4}x + 698\).

Next, we solve equations (3) and (4) for \(c\) and \(d\):
Subtract equation (3) from equation (4):
\[ (20c + d) - (16c + d) = 853 - 566 \implies 4c = 287 \implies c = \frac{287}{4} \]
Substitute \(c = \frac{287}{4}\) into equation (3):
\[ 16\left(\frac{287}{4}\right) + d = 566 \implies 1148 + d = 566 \implies d = -582 \]

So, \(Q(x) = -2x^2 + \frac{287}{4}x - 582\).

Finally, we find \(P(0) + Q(0)\):
\[ P(0) = 698 \]
\[ Q(0) = -582 \]
\[ P(0) + Q(0) = 698 - 582 = 116 \]

Thus, the answer is:
\[ \boxed{116} \]
