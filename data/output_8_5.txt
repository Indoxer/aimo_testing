 The problem: 
In isosceles trapezoid $ABCD$, parallel bases $\overline{AB}$ and $\overline{CD}$ have lengths $500$ and $650$, respectively, and $AD=BC=333$. The angle bisectors of $\angle{A}$ and $\angle{D}$ meet at $P$, and the angle bisectors of $\angle{B}$ and $\angle{C}$ meet at $Q$. Find $PQ$.


To find the length of \(PQ\) in the isosceles trapezoid \(ABCD\), we start by determining the height of the trapezoid. Let's denote the height of the trapezoid by \(h\).

First, drop perpendiculars from points \(A\) and \(B\) to line \(CD\), meeting \(CD\) at points \(E\) and \(F\) respectively. This creates two right triangles, \(\triangle ADE\) and \(\triangle BCF\), and a rectangle \(ABFE\). The length of \(EF\) is equal to the length of \(AB\), which is 500. Therefore, the lengths of \(DE\) and \(CF\) are each \(\frac{650 - 500}{2} = 75\).

Now, we can use the Pythagorean theorem in \(\triangle ADE\):
\[
AD^2 = DE^2 + AE^2 \implies 333^2 = 75^2 + h^2 \implies 110889 = 5625 + h^2 \implies h^2 = 105264 \implies h = \sqrt{105264} = 324.
\]

Next, we need to find the coordinates of points \(P\) and \(Q\). Since \(P\) is the intersection of the angle bisectors of \(\angle A\) and \(\angle D\), and \(Q\) is the intersection of the angle bisectors of \(\angle B\) and \(\angle C\), both \(P\) and \(Q\) lie on the line that is the perpendicular bisector of \(AB\) and \(CD\), which is also the line through the midpoints of \(AB\) and \(CD\).

The midpoint of \(AB\) is \((250, 0)\) and the midpoint of \(CD\) is \((625, 0)\). The distance between these midpoints is \(625 - 250 = 375\). Since \(P\) and \(Q\) are equidistant from these midpoints along the height of the trapezoid, the distance \(PQ\) is equal to the height of the trapezoid, which is 324.

Thus, the length of \(PQ\) is \(\boxed{324}\).
