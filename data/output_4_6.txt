 The problem: 
Let $S$ be the set of all rational numbers that can be expressed as a repeating decimal in the form $0.\overline{abcd},$ where at least one of the digits $a,$ $b,$ $c,$ or $d$ is nonzero. Let $N$ be the number of distinct numerators obtained when numbers in $S$ are written as fractions in lowest terms. For example, both $4$ and $410$ are counted among the distinct numerators for numbers in $S$ because $0.\overline{3636} = \frac{4}{11}$ and $0.\overline{1230} = \frac{410}{3333}.$ Find the remainder when $N$ is divided by $1000.$


To solve the problem, we first need to understand the structure of the repeating decimals in the set \( S \). A number in \( S \) can be written as \( 0.\overline{abcd} \), which represents a fraction of the form \( \frac{n}{9999} \), where \( n \) is an integer between 0 and 9999 (inclusive) and the decimal repeats every four digits.

The key is to determine how many distinct numerators we get when these fractions are reduced to their lowest terms. This means we need to consider the possible values of \( n \) such that \( \gcd(n, 9999) = 1 \). The number 9999 factors as \( 9999 = 3^2 \times 11 \times 101 \). Therefore, \( n \) must not be divisible by 3, 11, or 101.

We use Euler's totient function \( \phi \) to count the number of integers from 1 to 9999 that are coprime with 9999. The formula for Euler's totient function is:
\[
\phi(9999) = 9999 \left(1 - \frac{1}{3}\right)\left(1 - \frac{1}{11}\right)\left(1 - \frac{1}{101}\right) = 9999 \cdot \frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{10}{11} \cdot \frac{100}{101} = 6000
\]
Thus, there are 6000 integers between 1 and 9999 that are coprime with 9999. Since 0 is also included and does not affect the count of numerators, the total number of distinct numerators is 6000.

Finally, we need to find the remainder when 6000 is divided by 1000:
\[
6000 \mod 1000 = 0
\]
Therefore, the remainder when \( N \) is divided by 1000 is \(\boxed{0}\).
