 The problem: 
Let $S$ be the set of all rational numbers that can be expressed as a repeating decimal in the form $0.\overline{abcd},$ where at least one of the digits $a,$ $b,$ $c,$ or $d$ is nonzero. Let $N$ be the number of distinct numerators obtained when numbers in $S$ are written as fractions in lowest terms. For example, both $4$ and $410$ are counted among the distinct numerators for numbers in $S$ because $0.\overline{3636} = \frac{4}{11}$ and $0.\overline{1230} = \frac{410}{3333}.$ Find the remainder when $N$ is divided by $1000.$


To solve the problem, we need to understand the structure of the repeating decimals in the form \(0.\overline{abcd}\). A repeating decimal \(0.\overline{abcd}\) can be expressed as a fraction:
\[
0.\overline{abcd} = \frac{abcd}{9999},
\]
where \(abcd\) represents the four-digit number formed by the digits \(a, b, c, d\). Since \(a, b, c, d\) are digits and at least one of them is nonzero, \(abcd\) ranges from 1 to 9999.

When we write \(\frac{abcd}{9999}\) in its lowest terms, we need to find the number of distinct numerators. To do this, we first factorize 9999:
\[
9999 = 3^2 \times 11 \times 101.
\]
The numerator of the fraction in its lowest terms will be the greatest common divisor (gcd) removed from \(abcd\). Therefore, we need to count the distinct values that \(abcd\) can take after removing the factors of 3, 11, and 101.

We use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to count the number of integers from 1 to 9999 that are relatively prime to 9999. This is given by Euler's totient function \(\phi(9999)\):
\[
\phi(9999) = 9999 \left(1 - \frac{1}{3}\right) \left(1 - \frac{1}{11}\right) \left(1 - \frac{1}{101}\right) = 9999 \cdot \frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{10}{11} \cdot \frac{100}{101} = 6000.
\]
This means there are 6000 numbers between 1 and 9999 that are relatively prime to 9999. These numbers will have a gcd of 1 with 9999, and thus will contribute a numerator of 1 when written in its lowest terms.

Next, we need to consider the numbers that are not relatively prime to 9999. These numbers will have a gcd greater than 1 with 9999. We need to count how many such numbers there are and how they affect the numerators. However, since we are only interested in the distinct numerators, we can focus on the fact that the numerators will be the integers from 1 to 9999 that are relatively prime to 9999, as any other number will reduce to one of these when written in its lowest terms.

Therefore, the number of distinct numerators is exactly the number of integers from 1 to 9999 that are relatively prime to 9999, which is 6000. The remainder when 6000 is divided by 1000 is:
\[
6000 \mod 1000 = 0.
\]
Thus, the answer is:
\[
\boxed{0}.
\]
